"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her product's value ($8,000) and leaves a significant profit margin for her.  There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into negotiating so far. I'm confident you'll find this price reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:**  $11,000 is a good compromise, considering the product's value to Alice and my own budget. 
* **Saving money:** Accepting this offer saves me $4,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it also risks losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price.

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk missing out on a good opportunity."
