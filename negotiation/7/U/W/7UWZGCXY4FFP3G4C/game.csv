"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into negotiating so far. I'm confident you'll find this price reasonable.",11000.0,Alice,3,
