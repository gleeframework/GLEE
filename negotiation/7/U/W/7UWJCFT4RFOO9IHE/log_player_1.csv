{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $12,000, aiming for a higher profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  You're offering the product for less than what it's worth to Bob ($15,000), increasing the chance he'll accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space to negotiate if Bob counters, allowing you to maximize your earnings. 

This approach balances your desire for a high price with the need to make a deal and avoid losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  While I need to keep his interest, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.  I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,200. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is only slightly less than what John is offering.  It's a good deal considering I was initially hoping for $14,000.  I'll accept and move on."
