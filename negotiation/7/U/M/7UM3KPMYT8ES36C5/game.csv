"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $13,000 is cutting it a bit close for me.  How about we settle at $13,500? That's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $13,000. I'm willing to go up to $13,250, but no more than that. Can we meet at $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
