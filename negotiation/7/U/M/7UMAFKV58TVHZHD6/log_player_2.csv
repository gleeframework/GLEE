"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. He has 10 rounds, so he should try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better price than the initial offer, he can likely negotiate further and get closer to his desired price. It's too early to accept, and he still has several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This price allows me to move forward with the purchase while ensuring you get a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 doesn't quite work for me. How about $890,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward. Let's close this deal and make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $890,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $875,000.  Considering that Bob has already rejected two counteroffers, there's a chance Alice might become less willing to negotiate further. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer and allows Bob to move forward with the purchase. While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John or further negotiation stalling the process outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price."
