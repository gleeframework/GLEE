"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
