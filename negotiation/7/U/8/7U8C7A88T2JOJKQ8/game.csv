"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000, which is a significant discount from its true value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1150000, but I believe the product's value is worth more than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm open to further discussion.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $1150000 is still more than I can reasonably afford. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1100000. This reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1150000, so I'm offering $1125000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can seal the deal at this price.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
