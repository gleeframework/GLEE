"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he can potentially get it for less by continuing to negotiate with Alice or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is tempting, I need to be closer to $14,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference at $13,250? This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a price below its actual value. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what he'd pay for John's product. Bob has room to negotiate further and try to get closer to his desired price."
