"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is tempting, I need to be closer to $14,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference at $13,250? This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a price below its actual value. Let's close this deal!",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,250.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and it's closer to your asking price.  Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
