Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth millions in the right hands. I'm offering it to you first, for $1,850,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 means there's room for a significant profit margin.  
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net.  This allows for an ambitious opening offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's potential value (""worth millions""), creating a sense of scarcity and urgency.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to anchor Bob's thinking at a high price point. Even if he rejects the initial offer, it sets the stage for negotiation where a final price significantly above $1,000,000 is still very possible."
