"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm not comfortable with the price at this time. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $850000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $775000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm counteroffering at $825000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.  How does that sound to you?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800000, but I'm still not quite ready to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $825000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Let's see if we can make it work.",825000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $810000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about making a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $810000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm counteroffering at $820000.
