"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,025,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land closer to $900,000. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm offering $950,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows us to both come to a fair agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
