"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This is a great price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,250. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, as I mentioned before. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,8,
