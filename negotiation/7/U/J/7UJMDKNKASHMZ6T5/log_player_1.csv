Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  $8,500 is too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,000 is getting closer to my goal, I still think I can get a bit more.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,250. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, as I mentioned before. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that?

It's getting late in the game and Bob seems stubborn. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and saves me more time and effort."
