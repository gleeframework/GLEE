I'm starting high with $1,800,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, so I'm not willing to accept anything below that.  Let's see what Bob offers!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm counteroffering with $1,500,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my valuation."

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly higher price than Bob's offer to see if we can bridge the gap."

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above Bob's last offer, showing I'm ready to close the deal.  I'm hoping this small increase will convince Bob to accept."
