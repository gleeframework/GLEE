{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is only $1 less than John's price, it's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower to make the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a significant discount of $50,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's a price that's still above my ideal, but it gives us a good starting point for negotiation. If she rejects, I'll continue to adjust my offer based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 960000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $960,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to my target. It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
