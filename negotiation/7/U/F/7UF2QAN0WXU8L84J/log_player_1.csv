Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value and would be beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's maximum leaves a small window for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than $100, making this offer low-risk."
