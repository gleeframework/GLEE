"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, reflecting the value I know this product will bring you.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's a price that reflects the product's true value.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
