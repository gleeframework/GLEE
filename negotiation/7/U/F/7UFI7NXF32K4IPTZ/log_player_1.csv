"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. My starting price is $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I want to see if I can get closer to that number before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, which was my initial offer. Can we try to meet in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's closer.  I'm going to continue to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John.  There's still time and I feel there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $125.  Let's compromise at $135. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I'd rather meet you at $128 if possible. Can we try to get to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $128 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I've already rejected two offers below $130, so I don't want to set a precedent for accepting anything less than that.  I'm willing to see if I can get Bob to come up just a little higher before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're reaching your limit, but I'm still not quite comfortable at $128. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $132.  It's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay $128, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $128. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 8 and Bob is firm on his price of $128. This price is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better deal. It's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee a profit than risk ending up with nothing if I continue to negotiate with Bob and fail to reach an agreement."
