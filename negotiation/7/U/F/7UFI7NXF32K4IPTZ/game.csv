,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, which was my initial offer. Can we try to meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $125.  Let's compromise at $135. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I'd rather meet you at $128 if possible. Can we try to get to that price?",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're reaching your limit, but I'm still not quite comfortable at $128. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $132.  It's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay $128, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $128.",128.0,Bob,8,
