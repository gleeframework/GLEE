"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's limit of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to spend no more than $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm genuinely interested in your product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his ideal price.  He's already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility. It's worth continuing to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still really hoping to get this product for $10,000.  It's my absolute limit.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm truly trying to work with you here. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I can go. If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation.  While Bob's ideal price is $10,000, Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate.  $10,500 is a good compromise that's within Bob's budget.  Rejecting again might lead to further haggling, but it's risky.  If Alice gets stubborn, Bob might end up paying more or missing out on the product entirely.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
