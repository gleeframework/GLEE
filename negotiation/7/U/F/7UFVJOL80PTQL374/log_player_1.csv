"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to spend no more than $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm genuinely interested in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still really hoping to get this product for $10,000.  It's my absolute limit.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I understand he's sticking to his $10,000 limit, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm truly trying to work with you here. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I can go.
