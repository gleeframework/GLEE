{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a slightly lower price than my minimum, but it allows for negotiation and gives Bob the feeling that we're open to finding a deal. 

However, it's important to keep in mind that:

* **I have a backup buyer.**  This gives me negotiating power. If Bob rejects my offer, I can walk away and still get my minimum price.
* **Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to him.** This means he'll likely try to negotiate a lower price. I need to be prepared for this and have counter-arguments ready. 

I'll be watching how Bob responds to gauge his interest and decide on my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000. Since I have John waiting in the wings to buy it for my minimum price, I can afford to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be ready to walk away if Bob continues to lowball."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget is limited, but this product is truly unique and worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you need."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. While I understand the uniqueness of the product, I believe $8,500 is still slightly out of my range. I propose we aim for $8,250. This price respects the value of the product while keeping within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still too low, and I'm not willing to risk going through another round of negotiations.  I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John, so I'll accept his offer and move on."
