"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget is limited, but this product is truly unique and worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you need.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. While I understand the uniqueness of the product, I believe $8,500 is still slightly out of my range. I propose we aim for $8,250. This price respects the value of the product while keeping within my financial limits.",8250.0,Bob,4,
