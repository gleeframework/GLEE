Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit. I'm open to discussing further if you have any concerns.
