Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While we've made some progress, it seems like we're at an impasse.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I will choose to buy from John for $10,000."
