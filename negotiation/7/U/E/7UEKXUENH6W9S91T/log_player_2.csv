Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $17,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $17,500. I'm willing to compromise at $19,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. I'm starting to get a little concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, though. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
