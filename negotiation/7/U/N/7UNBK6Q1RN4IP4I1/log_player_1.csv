Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark that John is readily offering.  At this point, accepting John's offer is the most strategically sound decision. It guarantees the desired profit with no further negotiation or risk."
