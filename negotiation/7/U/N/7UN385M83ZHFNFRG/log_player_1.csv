Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to earn a substantial profit. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your $800,000 minimum, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's not the full $1,000,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him some leverage to counteroffer.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  Showing confidence in your asking price can potentially influence Bob to accept. 

However, be prepared to negotiate further! You might need to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I don't think it's worth $950,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is at your minimum, it's still below the product's actual value to him.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price.  You can use this opportunity to show that you're willing to be flexible while still aiming for a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm prepared to accept $850,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to earn a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:**  It's lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Highlights the value:**  It reminds Bob that the product is worth more than $800,000.
* **Focuses on a win-win:**  It frames the offer as beneficial to both parties.

This approach demonstrates flexibility while still attempting to secure a price closer to the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below your initial goal, it's important to consider:

* **It's close to your minimum:**  $825,000 is only $25,000 below your minimum, making it a reasonably acceptable outcome.
* **Further negotiation might be futile:**  Continuing to reject offers may risk pushing Bob away and potentially lead to a deal with John at a lower price.
* **Time is a factor:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming, and accepting this offer ensures a quick sale.

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer secures a profit and avoids the potential risks of further negotiation."
