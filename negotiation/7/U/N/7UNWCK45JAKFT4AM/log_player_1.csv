Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a fair offer:**  It's not too aggressive and shows you're willing to compromise.

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while keeping the negotiation open.  If Bob rejects, you can assess the situation and decide whether to counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's also below the price John is willing to pay. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue negotiating with him and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
