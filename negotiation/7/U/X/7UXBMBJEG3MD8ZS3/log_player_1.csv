Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and continue negotiating.  I'm not yet ready to settle for the John offer, as it's significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,250,000 is still below my target.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. The John offer is still not attractive enough to close the deal at this stage."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm not willing to settle for $1,225,000 just yet, especially since I have a few rounds left to reach a more favorable agreement. The John offer remains less appealing than what Bob is potentially willing to pay."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire with only two rounds remaining. Bob's latest offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than my ideal price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a high chance he won't budge further.  Given the limited time and the potential risk of ending up with a price I'm not satisfied with, selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a sale and secures a decent profit. It's a tough decision, but the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential loss."
