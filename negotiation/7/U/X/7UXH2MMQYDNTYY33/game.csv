"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product for a price that I think is very reasonable, considering its value to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair deal to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $12,200. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand this is your final offer, Alice, and I respect that.  Could we meet in the middle at $12,100?  That's the best I can do.",12100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $12,100, Bob, as it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12500.0,Alice,7,
