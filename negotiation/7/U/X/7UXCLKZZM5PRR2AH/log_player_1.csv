Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $120, the highest price Alice could theoretically get is $119 (leaving Bob with a $1 gain).
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. If Alice aims too high and Bob rejects the offer, she still makes a profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering $119 makes it very tempting for Bob to accept. He gets the product he values and saves a little, while Alice maximizes her profit."
