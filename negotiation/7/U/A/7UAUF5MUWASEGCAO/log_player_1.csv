This offer sets a starting point that is above your minimum value, giving you some room to negotiate. It also allows you to assess Bob's interest in the product and gauge how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'll try to counter with a higher price and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that's fair for both of us."
