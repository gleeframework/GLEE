"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within my budget. This gives us room to negotiate and shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great discount from the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'll try to find some common ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value this product, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a great deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows my willingness to meet halfway and makes it easier for Alice to accept a deal. The price is still within my budget and hopefully attractive enough for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. It's a good compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was thinking of. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget, although it's getting closer.  I'm not ready to give up on negotiating yet.  I'll try to counteroffer with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  Let's try $9,750. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also being within my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate, but this time I'm making a smaller step in my counteroffer. I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to keep the price as close to my target as possible. $9,750 is a price that hopefully feels more appealing to Alice without pushing her too far."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $10,500, which would be $10,125. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,125 is still above my budget of $8,000. While we are getting closer to a deal, I've already gone through 6 rounds of negotiation, and it seems Alice is not willing to go lower than $10,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation that may not result in a better price."
