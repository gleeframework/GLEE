"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm keen on making this work, $1,000,000 falls quite short of its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,150,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept.  Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
