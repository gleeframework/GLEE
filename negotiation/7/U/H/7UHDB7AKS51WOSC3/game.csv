"Alice,  $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1000000 is below my minimum, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet at $1750000?  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1750000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your budget constraints, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product.  Let's compromise at $1600000. This offer is a reasonable middle ground and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1400000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.  I'm confident this is a good opportunity for you as well.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
