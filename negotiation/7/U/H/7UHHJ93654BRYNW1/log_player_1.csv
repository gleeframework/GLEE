This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value of the product. This will be my starting point, and I'll adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am not able to pay $1,200,000 for it. Would you consider lowering the price? I am willing to pay up to $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if Bob will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $1,100,000 is the lowest I can go.  This product is truly unique and I believe it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the uniqueness of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my floor price of $1,000,000, and it's a significant improvement on his previous offer.  I'm willing to accept this offer to close the deal."
