"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit.  This price is still significantly less than Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point while leaving me space to adjust if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I still have 8 rounds to reach a deal with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, given that Bob's last offer was too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still not close to the value I believe the product holds. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm further lowering my offer but still aiming for a price above $1,000,000.  I want to show flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I'm also getting closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this deal meets my minimum threshold and secures a profitable sale.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of losing a sale altogether is too high."
