Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $20,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling the product for $18,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $17,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is getting very close to my minimum price. While I might be able to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more, it's getting risky. Accepting $17,500 guarantees a good profit and avoids the potential of losing the sale altogether.
