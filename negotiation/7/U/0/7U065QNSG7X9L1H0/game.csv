"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest!  $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a really high-quality product, and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is high-quality, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8500.  I'm still feeling a little tight on that number, but I'm willing to go down to $8750.  It's a fair compromise, and we can get this deal done.  Let me know what you think!",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $8750 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8200. Can you meet me there?",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8200.  I'm still holding out for a bit more to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and go with $8400? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?",8400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $8400. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price?,8000.0,Bob,8,
