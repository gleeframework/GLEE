Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,275,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,225,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a price point that's still significantly above my minimum. While his offer is getting more tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your persistence in finding the right deal. To demonstrate my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to accept $1,260,000. However, this is non-negotiable, and I need your decision today. This offer stands as a testament to the value I believe this product will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1260000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time Pressure:** By introducing a sense of urgency (""need your decision today""), I aim to push Bob closer to a decision.
* **Firmness:**  Labeling the offer as ""non-negotiable"" conveys seriousness and limits further haggling. 
* **Justification:** I'm still framing the price reduction as a benefit to Bob, highlighting the ""value"" he'll receive."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,260,000, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,230,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the potential returns it could bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could likely push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds, the potential gain is getting smaller and riskier. 
* **Bird in Hand:**  $1,230,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely in later rounds.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now allows me to utilize the funds sooner rather than later, potentially opening up new investment opportunities."
