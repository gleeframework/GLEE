Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price considering your value of the product is $1,000,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially having Alice reject your counteroffer, leading to you having to buy from John at a higher price."
