{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm asking for $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price well above my minimum. 
* **Confident Language:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" aim to increase its perceived worth in Bob's mind.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm directly asking for my desired price rather than suggesting a range, which can sometimes weaken your negotiating position.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  If Bob is risk-averse, he might be more likely to accept a price closer to his valuation to avoid losing the deal.
* **Time Constraints:** If I'm on a tight deadline, I might be willing to accept a lower price to guarantee a sale.

This offer aims to maximize my potential profit while acknowledging that I have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
