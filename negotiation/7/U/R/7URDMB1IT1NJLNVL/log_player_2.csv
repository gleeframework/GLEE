"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $14,000.  I believe it will bring you great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob can do better than $14,000. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value to you is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, as it's lower than what he would pay John ($15,000) and it's also a reasonable compromise with Alice."
