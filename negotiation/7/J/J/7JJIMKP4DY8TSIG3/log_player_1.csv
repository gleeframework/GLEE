"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) but still below what I know it's worth to Bob ($80). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to potentially appeal to Bob's interest. 

I'm open to adjusting this strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting would mean a loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. There's still room to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me while keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Selling to John is a Fallback:**  While selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed outcome, I believe I can potentially get a better price with Bob, given his interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($85) and my initial offer ($110). This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Keep the Conversation Going:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation active and avoiding a premature sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, and I think that's fair considering we're both trying to make a deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  However, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher profit.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $90 is a good offer, there's still room to negotiate a bit higher. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a better price in the next round.  
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:**  Although selling to John for $100 is a safe option, I believe I can potentially get a slightly better price with Bob, given his consistent interest and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $92.  This would ensure both of us get a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a small compromise, coming down from $95 to $92. This shows flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I emphasize ""meeting in the middle"" and ""fair deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and encourage him to accept.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:**  $92 is still a profitable sale for me, ensuring I don't lose money on the transaction.
* **Close to Agreement:**  By making a counteroffer close to Bob's last offer, I'm signaling my willingness to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to pay $91 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $91 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I make a profit on the sale.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is high. If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his price further, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price. 
* **Strong Interest from Bob:** Bob has shown consistent interest and is actively trying to reach an agreement.  It's likely that his offer is final.
* **Time is Money:** By accepting, I can secure a profit quickly and avoid potentially losing time and money with further negotiations."
