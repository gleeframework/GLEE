"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle for $10000.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $13000? It's still a great deal for a product like this.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession - how about $12500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11800, which is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",11800.0,Bob,6,
