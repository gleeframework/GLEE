"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high value and relevance to your requirements, we believe it's worth $8,000. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it will bring to you, I am offering this opportunity at the same price. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, she's offering the product at her own valuation, not lower. Since you have the option to buy from John at the same price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer. Rejecting might prompt a better offer from her, or you can always buy from John at $8,000."
