Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'd like to offer you. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, which might make Bob more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  Bob is showing interest and I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $85, which is closer to my desired price.  While I could potentially try to push for a higher amount, there's a risk of losing the sale altogether.  At this point, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best way to secure a decent profit."
