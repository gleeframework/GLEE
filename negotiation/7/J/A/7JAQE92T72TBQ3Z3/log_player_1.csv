Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,800,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a better price. I have 9 rounds remaining, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
