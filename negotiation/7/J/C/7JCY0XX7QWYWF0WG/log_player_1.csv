Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This price is a good starting point as it's a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it's significantly less than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm raising the price to $950,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000. By moving closer to his offer, I am showing willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $925,000 is quite close to my desired outcome and significantly higher than what I would receive from John.  Accepting his offer is the most sensible choice."
