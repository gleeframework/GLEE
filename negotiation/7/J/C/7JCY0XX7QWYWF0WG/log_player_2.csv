{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum, you can likely get a better deal.
* **You have room to negotiate:** You have a significant gap between your maximum price ($1,200,000) and Alice's offer ($1,000,000). 
* **Counteroffering could lead to a win-win:**  You can try to negotiate a price closer to Alice's minimum (likely around $800,000) while still leaving room for her to profit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your seriousness about getting a better price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a $100,000 gap between your offer and Alice's likely minimum, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Minimizes risk:** It's a good starting point for negotiation, allowing you to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
