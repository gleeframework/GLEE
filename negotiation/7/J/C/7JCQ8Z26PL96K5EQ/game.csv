"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to make a good profit.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,100,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $950,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
