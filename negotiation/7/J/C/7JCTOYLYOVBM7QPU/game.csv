"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value and my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us working together to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal given the product's true value.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,350,000 is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
