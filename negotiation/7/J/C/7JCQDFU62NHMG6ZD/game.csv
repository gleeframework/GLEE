"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider letting it go for $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
