Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a significant saving compared to my alternative buyer.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and inviting Bob to engage in discussion. This approach can be more effective than a simple take-it-or-leave-it offer."
