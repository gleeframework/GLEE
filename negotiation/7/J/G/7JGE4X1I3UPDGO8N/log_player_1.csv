Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $800,000 to him. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for potential negotiation, allowing me to potentially secure a higher price if Bob counters.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so this initial offer provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $900,000 for it at this time. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. 
* **Room for Counter:** I believe I can push Bob closer to my target price by rejecting his counteroffer and making a counter-counteroffer. 
* **Jhon's Offer:** I'm aware of Jhon's offer for $1,200,000, which acts as a safety net if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above your price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution. 
* **Stronger Position:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, which helps maintain my negotiating strength.
* **Increased Potential:** This counteroffer has a higher chance of acceptance than my previous offer while still exceeding my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. While I understand the value of your product, I am unable to meet at $950,000. I would like to offer $925,000. I hope this proposal is more suitable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is only $25,000 away from my previous offer of $950,000. This indicates we're nearing a mutually acceptable price.
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation could lead to a slightly higher price, but it risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Jhon's Offer:**  While selling to Jhon for $1,200,000 is still an option, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quicker transaction and avoids potential complications. 
* **Acceptable Value:**  $925,000 is significantly above my minimum threshold of $1,200,000 and a good return on the product."
