"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low.  $11,000 is my lowest offer. If we can agree on that price, I'm happy to close the deal. Let's see if we can work something out.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to close the deal.  Let's make it happen!",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,900. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,900 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $10,800?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10800.0,Bob,6,
