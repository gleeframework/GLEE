"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to the $150 value Bob sees in the product, without pushing him away with an unrealistic price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than my minimum of $80, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $120 was a bit high.  Let's try $100.  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you see in the product, and it's closer to what I need to get."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $100 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$95 is a good price for me.  It's above my minimum, and Bob seems to be getting closer to my desired price.  I think it's a good compromise."
