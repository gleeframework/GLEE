Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering Bob a price of $1,500,000. This is a higher price than John's offer of $1,200,000, but it's still below the product's minimum value to me. 
* This strategy aims to maximize profit by:
    * **Getting a higher price:** There's a chance Bob might value the product more than $1,500,000 and accept the offer.
    * **Minimizing risk:**  If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, ensuring a reasonable profit.

By offering a price slightly higher than John's, I'm balancing the potential for higher earnings with the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
