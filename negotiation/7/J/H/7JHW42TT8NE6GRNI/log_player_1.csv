"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer.  We'll see how he responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get more. Bob's counter-offer shows he is willing to negotiate, so I'll continue to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000} 
```

I'm making a slight concession from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  This counter-offer shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway, while still leaving space for potential future concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,375,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'm not sure if I can push Bob higher, but I have a few rounds left to explore.  I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going back to Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway and potentially close the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I have a few rounds left to see if I can push him a bit further. We're getting close to the point where selling to John might be the better option, but I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again.  This is likely my final counteroffer before considering selling to John.  If Bob rejects this offer, it's time to evaluate the risk of continuing with him versus securing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached the point where it's more advantageous to accept John's offer. The price is lower than what I've been hoping for, but it's still above my minimum, and Bob's counteroffers are getting too low.  I'm running out of time, and securing the deal with John guarantees a sale without further risk."
