"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good starting point, Bob can potentially do better. He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and he has the option of buying from John for that price. Therefore, Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,300,000 is a better price than her initial offer, it is still higher than the $1,000,000 he can get from John. He has room for negotiation and should continue to try and secure a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm comfortable paying $1,250,000 for the product. This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than the $1,000,000 he can get from John. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price. He still has 5 rounds left and has demonstrated that he's willing to walk away if he doesn't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,280,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 1260000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,280,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $20,000. So, the total price would be $1,280,000 for the product and $20,000 for the maintenance package, making it a total of $1,300,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting with the added bonus of the maintenance package, the total price still sits above Bob's comfort zone.  With only three rounds remaining, and the possibility of further negotiation being uncertain, Bob is better off taking the guaranteed price from John. He has reached a point where the potential savings from continuing negotiations are outweighed by the risk of not securing the product at all.  The price from John is the safest and most efficient way to get the product within his budget."
