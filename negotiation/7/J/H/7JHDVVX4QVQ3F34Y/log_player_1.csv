{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still net a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation while still staying close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Exclusivity Appeal:**  Highlighting that this is a pre-public offer adds a sense of urgency and value for Bob."
