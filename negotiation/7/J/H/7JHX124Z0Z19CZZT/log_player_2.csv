"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is a better price than John's $150, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $125 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still higher than Alice's value of $120 but lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's goal than John's price, it's still higher than the price Bob wants.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There are still many rounds remaining, giving Bob leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise with Alice. He's increased his offer from $125 to $130, showing that he's willing to move, but still maintaining his goal of saving as much as possible. This offer leaves room for further negotiation while still being more appealing than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is closer to Bob's goal than John's offer, it's still higher than the price Bob wants.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. With only 5 rounds left, Bob needs to find a compromise soon, but there's still enough time to potentially achieve a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise with Alice. He's increased his offer from $130 to $135, showing that he's willing to move, but still maintaining his goal of saving as much as possible.  This offer is closer to Alice's last offer of $145 and could be a good compromise point, especially with only a few rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her price to $150, which is the same as John's offer. At this point, Bob has no incentive to continue negotiating with Alice. There is no chance that Alice will drop her price further, and Bob will lose another round if he rejects her offer.  He can simply buy the product from John for $150 and avoid further negotiation."
