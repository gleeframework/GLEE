"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
