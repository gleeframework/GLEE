Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges the value to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is a good price, I can potentially do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm willing to go a bit lower to $13,500. This is still a great price for you, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Can you meet me at $12,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent profit."
