Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. That's my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $9,500. Bob's offer is too low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8,500? This would still give you a good deal, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $8,250 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I believe I can still squeeze out a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still slightly too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,375?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 8375} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $8375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like we're at an impasse. It's getting too close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer any further. To avoid losing valuable time, I'll sell the product to John for $8,000."
