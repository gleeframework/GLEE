Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While aiming high, a price too close to $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a fair deal and could lead to rejection.

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a sale above your minimum price."
