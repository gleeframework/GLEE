"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is way above my budget of $8,000. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer on the table, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price.  I'm not willing to buy from John yet, as I might be able to secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as my initial offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,250 for the product. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to reach my target price. I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is my best and final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high for me.  I've reached the point where further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring I stay within my budget."
