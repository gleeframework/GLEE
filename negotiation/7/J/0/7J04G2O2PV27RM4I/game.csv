"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer on the table, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as my initial offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,250 for the product. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
