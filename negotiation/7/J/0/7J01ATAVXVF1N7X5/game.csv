"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is far beyond my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $800000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we've discussed.  Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offers, and I truly believe it's the fairest price we can both agree on. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. While $1100000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm offering $1000000 for the product.  This is a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to reach a final price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your efforts to find common ground. However, $1000000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to come down in price. While $1150000 is getting closer, it's still not within my budget. I'm going to offer $1050000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we've discussed. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
