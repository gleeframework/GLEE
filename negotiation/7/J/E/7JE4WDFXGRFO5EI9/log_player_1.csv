Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice subtly introduces the possibility of Bob missing out, potentially pushing him to accept.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone remains conversational (""What do you think?"") allowing Bob to counter-offer or engage in negotiation.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has room to negotiate down towards her minimum of $15,000, knowing she has John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
