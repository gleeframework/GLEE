**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the door open for a potential counter-offer closer to your budget or can proceed with your backup plan."
