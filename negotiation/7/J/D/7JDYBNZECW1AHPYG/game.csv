"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,800. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",12800.0,Alice,5,
