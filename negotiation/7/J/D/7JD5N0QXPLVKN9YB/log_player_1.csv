Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation and potential counteroffers.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It shows that you're willing to negotiate, but also value your product. 

By offering a slightly lower price, you may incentivize Bob to accept your initial offer, while still giving yourself room to negotiate if he chooses to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  You should reject his offer and counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my original offer. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $85 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $77 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $80 you can get from John.  Since you're aiming to maximize your profit, selling to John is the best option in this scenario."
