"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my original offer. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $85 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",77.0,Bob,4,
