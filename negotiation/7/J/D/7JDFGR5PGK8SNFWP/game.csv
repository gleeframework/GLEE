"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12000. I'm willing to consider a price of $13500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11750? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not ready to accept $11750. I'm willing to consider a price of $12800, which is a bit higher than my previous offer. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. How about $11000? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
