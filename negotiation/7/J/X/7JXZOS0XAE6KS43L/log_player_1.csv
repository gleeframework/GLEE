Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth a great deal more, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible, while still exceeding her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers (""before I make it available to others"") can incentivize Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he's a savvy negotiator, he might try to lowball. Alice needs to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price she's comfortable with, knowing she has John as a backup buyer."
