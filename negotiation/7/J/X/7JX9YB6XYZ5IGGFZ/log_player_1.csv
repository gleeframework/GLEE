Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher price first.  
* **Finding a Balance:** Bob values the product at $800,000, and I value it at no less than $1,200,000.  Offering it at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation but keeps me well above Bob's valuation.
* **Psychology:** Starting with a strong offer shows I'm serious about the value, but the slightly lower price than my guaranteed sale might make Bob feel he's getting a better deal. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, I'm comfortable with that risk because I have a backup buyer."
