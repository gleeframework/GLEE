"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $950,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
