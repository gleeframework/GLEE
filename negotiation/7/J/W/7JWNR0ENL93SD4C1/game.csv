"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I appreciate you coming back with $8,000,  that price point wouldn't be feasible for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $11,500?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is a tempting offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. How about we split the difference and land at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
