"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing it's worth even more to you.  Let's discuss a mutually beneficial deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your maximum value:** $1,000,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000

You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. By rejecting, you can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John at your maximum price."
