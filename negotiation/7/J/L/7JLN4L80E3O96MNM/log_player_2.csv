"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very competitive price.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can save $5 by going with John. Her message is a bit pushy (claiming it's worth $100 to you), and you're willing to pay John $100. There's no guarantee she'll offer a lower price."
