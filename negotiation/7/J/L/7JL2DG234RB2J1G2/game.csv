"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that this product would be valuable for me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
