Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's below your minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation. This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer, while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John, so I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my ideal price.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  Given John's offer of $15,000, I'll sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
