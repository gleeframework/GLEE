"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
