Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has some wiggle room to counteroffer without feeling pressured.
* **It reflects the value to Bob:** It's lower than the $15,000 value to him, making it a potentially attractive deal.

I'll be ready to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $14,000. However, I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about if I offer you $13,000 for the product? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can push for a higher price.  The negotiation is still early, and there's a chance Bob will go higher to secure the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $13,500 is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer."
