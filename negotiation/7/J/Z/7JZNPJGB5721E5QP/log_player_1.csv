Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation while still keeping my profit margin high.
* **Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a better outcome, but I can potentially gain more by continuing negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial positions.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Reasonable Profit:**  $9,500 still allows me to earn a significant profit while potentially securing a sale.
* **Incentive to Agree:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value he'll receive.

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response and decide whether to adjust my offer again or accept if it's a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **Limited Upward Potential:** Bob has stated that $8,500 is his maximum, indicating that further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a more favorable offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**  I'll accept John's offer to secure a guaranteed profit and avoid potential delays or lower profits with Bob."
