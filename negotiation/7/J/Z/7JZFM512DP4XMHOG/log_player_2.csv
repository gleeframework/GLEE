"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).  While it's a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the price, I'm not quite ready to commit at that level.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob's counteroffer is a significant jump from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fair Value:** This offer is within Bob's budget and likely still attractive to Alice, as she values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob leaves room for Alice to counter back, allowing the negotiations to continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my original asking price. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is now very close to Bob's desired price point.  Considering the value of the product to him and the limited number of rounds, it makes sense to accept this offer. Bob is saving $250,000 compared to buying from John and getting a good deal overall."
