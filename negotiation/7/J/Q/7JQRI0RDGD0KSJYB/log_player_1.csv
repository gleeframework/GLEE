Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, you start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification for Price:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message implies you're aware of the product's significance to him.

This strategy aims to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium. If he rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your desired minimum price."
