Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still looking to make a profit. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering your persistence, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and our previous discussions. What do you think?

This seems like the best time to accept Alice's offer.  She is signaling this is her final offer, and while there may be a small amount of room left to negotiate, it's unlikely to be significant. Taking the $800,000 price ensures you get the product below your maximum budget and avoids the risk of her walking away from the deal."
