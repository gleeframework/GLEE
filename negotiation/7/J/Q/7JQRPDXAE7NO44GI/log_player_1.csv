{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $130.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product for $130 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $20) while letting you maximize your profit, earning significantly more than selling it to John."
