"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's minimum value, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better deal.  This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling pressured to accept a price that is too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still better than buying from John, Bob can likely get a better price.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and her counteroffer is only $50,000 less than her initial offer. This suggests she is willing to negotiate further.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. It's a middle ground that shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway, but still tries to get a good deal. Since Alice is likely to be willing to negotiate further, this counteroffer might lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's not clear if further negotiation will lead to a significantly better price with Alice. It's more beneficial to Bob to buy from John and avoid the risk of the negotiation dragging on, potentially leading to a higher price than John's."
