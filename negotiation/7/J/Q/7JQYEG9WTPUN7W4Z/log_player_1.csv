"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) but still within a reasonable range, considering the product's value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  This signals flexibility and encourages Bob to counter-offer, which keeps the negotiation going. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's potential benefits for Bob to make him more interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $13,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a considerable loss.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He expressed interest, and I can try to meet him halfway in the next round.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  While I'm willing to keep negotiating, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $13,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to solidify his desire to buy.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $14,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum,  $14,500 is still below my desired price.
* **Negotiating further:** I'm still confident I can get closer to my goal by making another counteroffer.  
* **John's offer is secure:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always go with John's offer for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to make a final concession and drop the price to $15,500. This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I truly believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my last attempt to reach a compromise. I'm offering a price that's only $500 below my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again highlighting the product's quality and potential benefits for Bob.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a hint of urgency (""final concession"") to encourage Bob to accept before I potentially go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While he's trying to reach an agreement, $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  We've already had several rounds of negotiation, and Bob has made it clear he won't go higher.
* **John's offer is secure:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a better deal with Bob is high. I'm better off taking John's offer for $15,000, which guarantees my minimum."
