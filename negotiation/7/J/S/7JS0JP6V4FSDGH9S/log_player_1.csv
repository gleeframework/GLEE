Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 130}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $90. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob that's higher than his offer but lower than my minimum price. Let's try to find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 110}

I'll wait to see what Bob thinks!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send the counteroffer I previously decided on:

{""product_price"": 110}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another offer of $100. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

However, I'm getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing the sale. I'll make a final counteroffer that's close to my minimum price.
