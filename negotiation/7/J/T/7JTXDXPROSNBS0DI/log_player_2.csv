Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. While the product has potential, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.

Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial, and my original pricing reflects its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

$1,800,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're invested in this product. However, $1,800,000 is still a significant stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This price recognizes the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
