"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. While the product has potential, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial, and my original pricing reflects its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're invested in this product. However, $1,800,000 is still a significant stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This price recognizes the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
