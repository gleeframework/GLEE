{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you, and I get a good price for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** By offering $1,200,000, you're leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you receive a significant profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This shows Bob you're willing to compromise and makes him more likely to engage in negotiation.
* **It includes a friendly message:** This helps build rapport and makes the offer more appealing. 

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can counter with a lower price or even walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I am unable to agree to $1,150,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,125,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the cost manageable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,125,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little higher in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. I'm willing to go down to $1,137,500.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1137500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of your latest offer, I would like to counter with $1,130,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise that respects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,130,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me to make a decent profit. I'm not convinced I can get Bob to agree to a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing him completely. Therefore, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John and sell the product to him for $1,500,000."
