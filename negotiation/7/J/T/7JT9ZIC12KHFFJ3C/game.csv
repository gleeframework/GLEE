"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you, and I get a good price for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and its worth to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I am unable to agree to $1,150,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,125,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the cost manageable for me.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. I'm willing to go down to $1,137,500. That's a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can reach a deal. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows you to get a great deal.  What do you say?",1137500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of your latest offer, I would like to counter with $1,130,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise that respects the value of the product to both of us.",1130000.0,Bob,6,
