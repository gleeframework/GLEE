""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000) allows for negotiation and profit maximization.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:** Emphasizing the exclusivity of the offer might make Bob more inclined to accept before he potentially loses the opportunity.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests a willingness to negotiate, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly justifies the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum acceptable amount.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of securing a price closer to $1,100,000. Even if Bob negotiates down, she still has a comfortable buffer before reaching her guaranteed sale price with John."
