"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  It offers unique capabilities that go beyond standard market offerings. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's value while recognizing your budget considerations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique capabilities, but I still believe $950,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous discussions, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we're getting closer. How about we settle on $1,000,000?  This reflects a significant investment from your end while still acknowledging the unique value proposition of the product.  Do you think this could work?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still think $950,000 is the maximum I can stretch to. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be within my budget. Can we meet at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
