"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). This means you can get a good deal while still ensuring Alice makes a profit."
