"I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product for a limited time. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is my best counteroffer for now.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,000, Bob. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make a profit. I can do $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from this price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
