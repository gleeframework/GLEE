"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer of $16,000 is far above your $8,000 limit and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to buy from John at a significantly lower price."
