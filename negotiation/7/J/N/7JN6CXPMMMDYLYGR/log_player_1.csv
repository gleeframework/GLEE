Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,000?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth more than that to me.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000, which is the price I can get from another seller. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob seems unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.  Since we have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, it makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob short and sell to John."
