This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum, but also leaving room for negotiation. It's a good strategy to start high and see how Bob reacts.  We'll adjust based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, while still getting me a decent price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a slightly higher price,  $12,500 is significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  It's a good deal considering it's above my minimum, and we've reached a point where further negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether."
