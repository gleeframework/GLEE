Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you might find valuable. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $10,000 gives me room to negotiate downward if Bob counter-offers.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging,  making Bob feel valued and more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the potential value of the product to Bob makes him consider the offer more seriously. 

This strategy allows me to maximize potential profits while keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and counter-offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7500.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$7,500 is below my minimum:**  I'm unwilling to sell for less than $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to pay more than his initial proposal.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially leading to a more profitable deal.

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired $8,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product. 
* **Justifying the price:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and open to discussion, keeping the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer balances my need to earn a reasonable price with my desire to continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to be in the $8000 range.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8250?  That would be a good middle ground for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $8,250 is only $250 below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Likely best outcome:**  Further negotiation might result in a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob backing out entirely is high. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $8,000 would net me less than accepting Bob's offer. 

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, securing a sale close to my minimum acceptable price and avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation."
