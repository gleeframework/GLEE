Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies it might be worth even more than $15,000 to Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice mentions she has another buyer, she doesn't want to rely on this too heavily.  It's more effective to focus on the value proposition for Bob.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"", Alice invites Bob to engage in a conversation rather than just giving a flat yes or no.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to make a deal he finds acceptable."
