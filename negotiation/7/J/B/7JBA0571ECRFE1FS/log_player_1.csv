"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secures a good price. I'm also leaving some buffer in case Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  I have 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $8,000 as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target. I'm also mindful of the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price of $8,000, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price. It's worth the risk to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $8,750. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob my willingness to meet him halfway, and encourage him to accept.  It's a calculated risk, but with 5 rounds remaining, I'm feeling optimistic about reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, it's a good deal considering the remaining rounds. There's a risk of getting a lower price if I continue, and I'm not sure if Bob is willing to go higher. It's safer to secure the deal at this price than to risk losing the sale completely."
