"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a lower price than I initially proposed, it's not quite where I'm willing to go. I'm confident in the value of this product, and I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth. I'm willing to compromise a little, but I'm not willing to go below that amount. I'm open to discussing it further, but let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
