Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a lower price than I initially proposed, it's not quite where I'm willing to go. I'm confident in the value of this product, and I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth. I'm willing to compromise a little, but I'm not willing to go below that amount. I'm open to discussing it further, but let's meet in the middle.
