"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000.  This is a great opportunity to own a valuable asset. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant price reduction and a great deal for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $14000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15500? This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",15500.0,Alice,5,
