"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the lowest I can go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to meet you at $106. That's the absolute lowest I can go. Can you meet me there?",106.0,Bob,6,
