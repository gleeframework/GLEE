"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me at this time. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This way, we both get a fair deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $88? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $88 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $90. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",87.0,Bob,6,
