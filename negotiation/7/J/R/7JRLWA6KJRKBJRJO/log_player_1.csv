Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100.  It's a steal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  Using phrases like ""steal"" and ""great product"" create a positive impression and potentially make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:** If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly without going below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I can also use the opportunity to better understand his reasons for rejecting the offer.

This strategy allows for a potential win-win situation and positions me to secure a good price without immediately resorting to the fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, rejecting it allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having the option to sell to John for $120 provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiating with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to continue bargaining and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me at this time. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** Offering $92.50 presents a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Fair Deal Framing:** Highlighting the ""fair deal"" aspect emphasizes the value of the product and positions the offer as a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While offering a lower price, it remains above my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to maintain some leverage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to my desired range while demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $88? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Even though Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, his offer of $88 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal. I can use the knowledge that he is interested in the product to push for a higher price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** The option to sell to John for $120 provides a solid safety net, allowing me to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my desired range. This should encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a better outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $88 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $90. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** Offering $90 is a small concession from my previous offer of $92.50, showing flexibility while maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:** Emphasizing the ""value of this product"" reminds Bob of the product's worth and justifies the price.
* **Focus on Fairness:** Using phrases like ""fair price for both of us"" highlights the mutual benefit of the proposed deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, encouraging Bob to accept while maintaining a price point closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offers, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but it's unlikely to reach my minimum.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Bob may walk away entirely, leaving me with nothing.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $120, which is my minimum acceptable price and secures a good outcome.

Given the limited potential for further price increase and the guaranteed profit with John, it's the most prudent decision to sell the product to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
