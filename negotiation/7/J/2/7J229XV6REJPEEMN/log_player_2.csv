"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1400000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and it's an excellent price considering the product's worth to you.  Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though she's offering a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to buy from John for the lower price."
