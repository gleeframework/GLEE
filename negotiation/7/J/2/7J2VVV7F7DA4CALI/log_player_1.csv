Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price closer to your own valuation leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for profit:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 still allows for a significant profit margin over John's offer ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies you're open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough to entice Bob into negotiations."
