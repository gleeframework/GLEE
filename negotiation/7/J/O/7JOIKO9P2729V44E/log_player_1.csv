{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by presenting a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at more than $10,000, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This price reflects the value you'll receive and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I've already made a significant concession, and further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better price.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure I get my minimum desired value."
