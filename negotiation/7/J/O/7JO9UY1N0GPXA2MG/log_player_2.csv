"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high.  We should try to negotiate it down closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach tests Alice's willingness to lower the price and gives us a sense of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved closer to our desired price range, but we can still try to negotiate a better deal.  We're very close to John's price, so Alice needs to come down further to be competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We are now negotiating strategically.  By suggesting a split of the difference ($8,500 offered by Alice and $6,500 offered by us), we're proposing a solution that seems fair and might be agreeable to Alice while still getting us closer to our desired price point.  We also don't want to go too low too quickly and risk offending Alice."
