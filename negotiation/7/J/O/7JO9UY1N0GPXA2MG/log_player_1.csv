Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, and I can adjust my price accordingly.
* This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still maintaining a chance of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  It's also far below the initial offer I made, which was already a considerable discount. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum value, giving me a better chance of securing a more profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** $8,500 is a compromise. It's halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $6,500. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a reasonable price.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate my stance. I use positive language (""good deal"") and emphasize the value of the product to encourage a deal.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. However, it's closer to my desired price and represents a significant increase from his previous offer.  

Considering that further negotiation could drag on and potentially lead to a lower offer, accepting his offer now guarantees a sale at a reasonable price. This is particularly important as I can always sell to John for $12,000 if this deal falls through."
