"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to my maximum budget of $8,000? I believe this product could still be valuable to me at a more reasonable price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my situation. While I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, I still feel that $11,500 is beyond my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to my maximum of $8,000? I'm hopeful for a mutually beneficial arrangement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
