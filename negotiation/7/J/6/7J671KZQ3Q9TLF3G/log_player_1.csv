Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to my maximum budget of $8,000? I believe this product could still be valuable to me at a more reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my situation. While I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, I still feel that $11,500 is beyond my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to my maximum of $8,000? I'm hopeful for a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly anchored at $8,000 and  unlikely to move much higher. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap. Selling to John ensures receiving the product's minimum value."
