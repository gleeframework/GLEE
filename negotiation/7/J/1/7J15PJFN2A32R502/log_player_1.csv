Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential win-win because your minimum is higher than Bob's maximum.  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could work.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate but avoid being so high that Bob walks away without countering.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting near the upper end of the potential agreement zone but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:** The language implies the product's value is even higher, giving you leverage.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to slightly reduce your price, but hold firm to a number above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup gives you a strong negotiating position.  You don't need to be desperate, which helps when negotiating with Bob."
