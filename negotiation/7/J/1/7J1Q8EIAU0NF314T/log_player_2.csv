"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a better deal than John's $100, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower price, hoping to bridge the gap between Alice's offer and his own budget. A $105 offer is still a decent profit for Alice, and hopefully, it will entice her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $115. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price.  Bob is determined to get the best possible deal and wants to continue negotiating. He can still potentially get a lower price if he keeps pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's close to his budget but also offers a decent profit for Alice.  $110 is a compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the direction we're heading, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. I'll offer it to you for $112. It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is only $2 more than Bob's counteroffer. While Bob wants to save as much money as possible, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to more rounds, and with only 5 rounds left, it's a risk to potentially end up buying from John for $100.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
