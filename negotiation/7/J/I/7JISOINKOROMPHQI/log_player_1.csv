{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm still willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only $5 more than what John would pay, it's still a better deal than my minimum value and worth the effort of the negotiation."
