"I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer, so I'll counter with $7200. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",7200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $7000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $7100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",7100.0,Alice,5,
