"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$600,000 is a good price, but there's potential for a better deal.**  It's always worth exploring options before committing. 
* **10 rounds is a lot of time to negotiate.**  There's no need to rush into a decision. 
* **Buying from John is a safety net.**  Knowing you have that option gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A $100,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is significant, but it's not unreasonable given the product's potential value to you.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further and give you an idea of her bottom line.
* **Staying within Budget:** The counteroffer keeps you well within your $800,000 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise between your last counteroffer and her previous offer. 
* **Value for Money:**  $550,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price and still within your budget.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal with Alice (or having to pay John's higher price) is not worth it at this point."
