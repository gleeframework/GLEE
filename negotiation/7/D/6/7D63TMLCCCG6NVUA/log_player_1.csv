{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain from its acquisition."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we have a strong alternative buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This allows us to start high.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offered price of $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still keeping us significantly above his valuation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential""  and ""significant returns"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth closer to our asking price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We expect Bob might counter-offer, and we'll need to be prepared to negotiate based on his response.  Our bottom line is to not go below $1,500,000 as we have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
