"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $110.
* **You save money compared to John:** Buying from Alice saves you $10 compared to buying from John. 

While you could potentially try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential savings."
