{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,100,000.  This price allows both of us to make a good profit while still respecting the value of this product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we are getting closer, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to secure a profitable deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than previous offers, it's still over his budget.  He should continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to his goal of $800,000. There's still time to reach a more favorable deal."
