Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's truly unique and I believe it would be a great asset to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value of $800,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before considering selling to John. I have 8 rounds remaining and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,100,000.  This price allows both of us to make a good profit while still respecting the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price would allow both of us to secure a fair deal and move forward.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,000,000. I have 6 rounds remaining and I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John in the following round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we are getting closer, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to secure a profitable deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a successful agreement. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  We only have four rounds remaining, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing."
