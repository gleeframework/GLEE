"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's truly unique and I believe it would be a great asset to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,100,000.  This price allows both of us to make a good profit while still respecting the value of this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price would allow both of us to secure a fair deal and move forward.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we are getting closer, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to secure a profitable deal.  Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a successful agreement. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
