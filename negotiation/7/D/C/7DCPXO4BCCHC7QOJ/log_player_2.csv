# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your backup plan."
