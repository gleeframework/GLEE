Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) without pushing him away.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,300,000 gives you significant room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a backup at $1,000,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so the offer to Bob should reflect that.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is professional and acknowledges the value proposition for Bob, increasing the chance of a successful deal."
