Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. Could you consider a price of $1,000,000? This allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm firm on my offer of $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob is unlikely to budge from his $800,000 offer.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
