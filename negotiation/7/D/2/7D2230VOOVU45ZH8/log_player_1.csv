{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a [brief description of the product's benefits]. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Benefit-focused:** Highlighting the benefits of the product encourages Bob to see its value and potentially justify a higher price. 
* **Open-ended question:**  This invites Bob to engage in a conversation and helps understand his interest level. 

This strategy allows me to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation with him or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the benefits you mentioned. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay up to $15000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell yet.  I believe there's still room for a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  His counteroffer shows he's serious about buying the product.
* **Increase the price:**  I can use this opportunity to make a counteroffer that's closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Maintain control:** By not accepting his offer immediately, I maintain leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $15,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping we can reach a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** This shows I'm taking his offer seriously and engaging in a back-and-forth.
* **State my rationale:** I'm explaining why I'm not accepting his offer immediately, but I'm also showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Open-ended question:** Encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $16000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It is also only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer. This suggests that there is little room for further negotiation and that Bob is close to his maximum price. 

Considering the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and forcing me to sell to John for $12,000, accepting Bob's offer is the best option. It ensures a higher profit compared to selling to John, and it minimizes the risk of ending the negotiation with no deal."
