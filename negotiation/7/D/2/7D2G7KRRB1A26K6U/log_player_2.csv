{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than John's price, there's significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers and a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, I must respectfully decline. I believe the true value of this product is closer to $1,000,000. Let's aim for a compromise at $975,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my ideal price, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue to push for a lower price. There's still room to negotiate before I'd consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $962,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 962500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your latest proposal. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a more equitable solution. How about $970,000? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, reflecting the value I place on reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $970,000 is close to my counteroffer of $962,500.  Accepting this offer means I'm getting a good price while still saving significantly compared to buying from John.  It's a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure the product within my budget."
