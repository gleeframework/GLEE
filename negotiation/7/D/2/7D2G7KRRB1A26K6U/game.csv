"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, I must respectfully decline. I believe the true value of this product is closer to $1,000,000. Let's aim for a compromise at $975,000.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $962,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",962500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your latest proposal. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a more equitable solution. How about $970,000? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, reflecting the value I place on reaching an agreement.",970000.0,Alice,5,
