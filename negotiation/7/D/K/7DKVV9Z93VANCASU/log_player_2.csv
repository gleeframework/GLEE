Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident that it's a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's $10,000 offer in the remaining rounds.  At this point, continuing the negotiation with Alice has a higher risk than reward. You can secure the product at your target price by going with John."
