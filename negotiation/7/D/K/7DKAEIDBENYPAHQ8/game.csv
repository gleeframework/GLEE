"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  However, $950,000 doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This price is a significant compromise, and I truly believe it's the best I can do.  If you're still interested, please let me know.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
