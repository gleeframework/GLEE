,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $90 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $87?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $87 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much profit. How about we try $92?",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to keep working with you.  $92 is closer, but I'm really hoping to get it for $89.  That would be a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $89 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $91, but that's as low as I can go.",91.0,Alice,7,
