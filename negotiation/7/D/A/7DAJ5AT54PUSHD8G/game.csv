"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise at $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
