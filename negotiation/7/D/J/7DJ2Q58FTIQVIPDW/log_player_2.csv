"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her product's value to her, you can get a better deal by buying from John for $100."
