Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $9,500.  I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential negotiation (if needed) while still aiming for a strong profit margin. 
* **Strong Initial Offer:** A confident initial offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product."
