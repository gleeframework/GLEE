"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, I'm going to need to come in lower than $900,000 to make this work for me.  How about $850,000?  This is still a good profit for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to prioritize my own interests and ensure I get a fair price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:** It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer.
* **The price is still within Bob's budget:** $875,000 is significantly less than the $1,000,000 Bob would pay John.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a much better price:** Alice has already moved closer to Bob's desired price, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether. 

Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a favorable price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
