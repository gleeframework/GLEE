Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, I'm going to need to come in lower than $900,000 to make this work for me.  How about $850,000?  This is still a good profit for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
