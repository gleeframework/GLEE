"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking for something within my budget of $80. Would you consider selling it for that amount?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good price for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose $95 as my offer. This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and I believe we could reach an agreement. I would like to counter with $100 for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my price. While I value our negotiation, $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's close this deal, how does that sound?",105.0,Alice,7,
