"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $170 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $170 is a price that Bob might be willing to negotiate down from, but it's still high enough to give me some profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise to close the deal, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking for something within my budget of $80. Would you consider selling it for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is simply too low to consider. I will continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if a reasonable price isn't reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good price for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm making a counteroffer that's still higher than Bob's offer, but significantly lower than my initial price. I'm also justifying the price by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $120 is closer to my minimum, it still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is hesitant. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly, which can help keep the negotiation from becoming adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose $95 as my offer. This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer isn't close enough for me to consider accepting. I will continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell to John, as time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm offering a moderate counter-offer, slightly closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to emphasize that it's a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Urgency Implicit:** While I don't explicitly mention the time limit, I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a good deal for both of us. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while still protecting my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and I believe we could reach an agreement. I would like to counter with $100 for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price of $150, $100 is still too low.  I'm running out of time, but I'm not going to give up on getting a better price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes that he'll increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my price. While I value our negotiation, $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's close this deal, how does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show I'm flexible, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I highlight that I'm making a ""significant compromise"" to encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Urgency:**  I use phrases like ""Let's close this deal"" to subtly emphasize that time is running out. 

This approach is designed to incentivize Bob to accept, while still protecting my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $102 for the product. This would be a fair compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $102 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's clear that we are not going to reach a deal that satisfies both of us.  I've already wasted several rounds and I'm running out of time. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
