# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though you're willing to spend up to $150, Alice is offering the product for $140, saving you $10.
* **It's still within your budget:** The price is below your maximum of $150. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
