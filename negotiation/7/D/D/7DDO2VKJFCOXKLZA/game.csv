"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a step closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This still allows me to achieve a good return on my investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
