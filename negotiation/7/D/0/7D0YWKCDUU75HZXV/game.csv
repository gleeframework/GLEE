"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1600000?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $1520000?",1520000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1520000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1580000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you say?",1580000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced $1580000 is the right price. I'm willing to compromise again, so how about we try $1550000?",1550000.0,Bob,6,
