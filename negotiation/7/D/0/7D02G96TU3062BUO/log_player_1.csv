"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters. If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still too low. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a profit significantly higher than what John would offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but still not at a point where I'm ready to accept. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to show commitment to a deal, but I'm also aware that we're running out of rounds. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is too high.  Even though I would prefer to get more, selling to John guarantees me my minimum value.  I'll cut my losses and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
