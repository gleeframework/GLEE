"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, Alice is clearly trying to oversell the product. There's a good chance you can get a better price by rejecting this offer and seeing if she'll come down.  You'll still have John as a backup option."
