Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,750,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer acts as a gauge for Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you haven't lost anything."
