{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
