"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $14000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's a range where both of us can benefit. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I'm willing to come down to $14200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,200 is still a good deal for me. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and it's close to my counteroffer of $13,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that the price won't drop significantly further, and I don't want to risk losing the product to someone else.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
