"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I'm willing to come down to $14200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000.",14200.0,Alice,3,
