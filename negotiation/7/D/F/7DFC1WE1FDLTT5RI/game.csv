"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,200. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $11,200. How about we try $10,975?",10975.0,Alice,5,
