"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing my own valuation.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates down, starting high increases the likelihood of a final price closer to my desired range.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's response will reveal how eager he is to buy and how much he might be willing to pay.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** By setting the initial price, I frame the negotiation on my terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in the next round to guide the price closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the product's value remains higher than your proposed price. Would you be willing to consider $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer as ""generous"" to build rapport and signal that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I lower my price by $250,000, a significant amount that might encourage Bob while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Maintain Value:** I reiterate the product's high value without directly rejecting Bob's perception. This keeps the negotiation focused on the product's worth.
* **Open Question:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation flowing. 

I believe this counteroffer strikes a balance between demonstrating flexibility and holding firm to a price point that reflects the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, the difference is no longer significant enough to risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
