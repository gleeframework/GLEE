"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it allows room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates that I believe in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is still a good value for me, as it's closer to my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm starting to feel like I might be better off selling to John. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round, but if it's rejected I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,450,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer and closer to my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I won't settle for a price too far below my value. If this is rejected, I'm likely going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm starting to run out of negotiating room.  It's getting increasingly likely that I won't be able to get closer to my desired price.  To avoid risking a further drop in price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees me a good outcome."
