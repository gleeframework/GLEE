"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, and you should aim to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the return on investment, but I believe this product has tremendous potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $820000. This price still reflects its true value, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your ideal range.  You've demonstrated you're willing to negotiate, so rejecting her offer allows you to continue the process and potentially get an even better price.  You can counter with a price slightly higher than your previous offer, showing you are serious but still aiming for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $780000. This price is still a good value for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the potential in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  $780,000 is a good price, especially considering you can always buy from John for $1,500,000.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a much lower price, and it's worth securing the product at this price."
