Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?
