This offer is exclusive to you and reflects our confidence in its ability to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this exceptional deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($950,000):** This is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and offers a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **John's price ($1,200,000):**  This is your fallback option, but it's more expensive.

Since Alice's offer is within your budget and cheaper than John's, it's the most financially advantageous choice."
