"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you considering your valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise considering the value this product holds for you. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  $875,000 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers at $887,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen.",887500.0,Alice,5,
