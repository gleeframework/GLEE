"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you considering your valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise considering the value this product holds for you. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. $900,000 is still higher than his desired price, but it's getting closer. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  $875,000 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers at $887,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $887,500 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer of $950,000, and it's closer to Bob's desired price point. 
* **Time:**  The negotiation is progressing, but it's important to consider the limited rounds remaining. 
* **Risk:**  While a slightly lower price might be achievable, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate or reject future offers, making the deal with John more likely. 

Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price without risking the opportunity entirely."
