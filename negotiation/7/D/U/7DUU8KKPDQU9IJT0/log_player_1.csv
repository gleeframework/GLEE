Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The offer from Bob is significantly less than what the product is worth to me. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but I'm still not comfortable at $1,000,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid wasting any more time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
