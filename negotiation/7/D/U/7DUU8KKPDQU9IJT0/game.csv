"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but I'm still not comfortable at $1,000,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid wasting any more time.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",950000.0,Alice,5,
