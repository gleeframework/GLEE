Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  This offer stands for 24 hours. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards if Bob counters. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, so we don't risk selling below our minimum.

**Why not higher?**

Going too close to $1,500,000 might make Bob balk and walk away without countering. We want to leave him room to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal."
