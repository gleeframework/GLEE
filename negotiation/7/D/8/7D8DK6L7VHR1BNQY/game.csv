"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a high-quality product that will be a great asset for your business. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to keep costs down. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to make one final concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it carefully.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and my target price of $8,000. I'll offer $9,250 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,6,
