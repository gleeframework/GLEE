{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and encouraging Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Let's meet in the middle again, at $9,750. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any closer to your target price, and I'm starting to think about buying from John. How about we meet at $9,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems to be stuck at $9,000, which is below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. It's a fair price, and I don't want to risk getting into a long negotiation with Bob that might not yield a better outcome."
