"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That way we both get a fair price.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's the best I can do.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Let's meet in the middle again, at $9,750. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not getting any closer to your target price, and I'm starting to think about buying from John. How about we meet at $9,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Bob,6,
