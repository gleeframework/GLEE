"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we settle at $700,000? That would make this a viable deal for me."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'll offer you a price of $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and you have a guaranteed option for $800,000 with John.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best price."
