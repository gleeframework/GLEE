Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product could be valuable for me, but the price needs to work on my end. How about we bring it down to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we settle at $700,000? That would make this a viable deal for me.
