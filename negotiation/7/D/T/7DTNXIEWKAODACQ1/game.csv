"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product could be valuable for me, but the price needs to work on my end. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we settle at $700,000? That would make this a viable deal for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'll offer you a price of $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
