Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that is above my minimum threshold of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be motivated to accept this offer as it's still below his perceived value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still below what I believe I can get. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $110. This is a compromise from my original offer and still provides a good margin for me. I believe this price is fair enough for Bob to accept, but also high enough to secure a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum threshold. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose him completely.  John is offering the same amount, so I'll sell to him to avoid any further delays or uncertainties."
