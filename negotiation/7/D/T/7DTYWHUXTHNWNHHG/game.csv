"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it would be closer to my desired price. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $950,000. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
