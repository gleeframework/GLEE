"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, my minimum price is $160, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. Is that something you'd be interested in?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $140 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $80? This would be a great opportunity for us to make a deal quickly.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $80, so I can offer it to you for $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for staying with me on this. I appreciate the compromise. How about we split the difference between $110 and $80 and close the deal at $95?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is still a compromise, but I need to make a profit. Is that something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,7,
