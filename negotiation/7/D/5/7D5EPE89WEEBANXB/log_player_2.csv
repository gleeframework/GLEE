"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is a concession, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You have two options:

1. **Reject and counteroffer:** This allows you to try and push for a lower price, ideally closer to your maximum budget of $800,000.
2. **Buy from John:**  This guarantees you the product at your maximum budget, but you miss the potential for a better deal.

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the more strategic option."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll make a counteroffer of $980,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $980,000.  While this is lower than her initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  

At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John, who is offering it for your maximum budget. You'll save $180,000 compared to Alice's offer.  While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price with Alice, the risk of further negotiations dragging on and potentially ending with a higher price than John's offer outweighs the potential savings."
