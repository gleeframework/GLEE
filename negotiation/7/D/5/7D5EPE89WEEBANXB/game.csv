"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair offer that allows you to make a profit, while giving me a good deal.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll make a counteroffer of $980,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
