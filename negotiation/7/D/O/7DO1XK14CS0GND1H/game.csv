"Hi Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I agree it has potential, the price point is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $1,400,000 is still quite a way from what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is substantial.  I can't go as low as $750,000.  Let's settle at $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction on my end.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement on price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my reach.  I can offer up to $800,000 for this product. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
