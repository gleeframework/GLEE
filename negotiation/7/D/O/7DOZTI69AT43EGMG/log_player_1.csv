Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $800,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, the product's value justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm confident the product is worth $800,000, and that's the highest I can go.  If you're not willing to accept that price, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his maximum budget of $800,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price. Since John is offering the same amount, it's time to move on and secure the sale."
