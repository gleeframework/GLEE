**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is only $20,000 above your target price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks her sticking to her ""final"" price or even walking away. Accepting the $720,000 secures the product at a good price."
