Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000** 
* **Lower than the product's worth to Bob of $10,000**

This creates a win-win situation:

* **I get a profit of $1,500, which is better than selling to John.**
* **Bob gets a good deal, saving $500 compared to his maximum willingness to pay.**

There's a good chance Bob will accept this offer, as he's still getting a bargain."
