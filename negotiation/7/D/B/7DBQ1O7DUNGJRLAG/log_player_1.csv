Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than what Bob values the product at ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to create a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Justification:** I'm giving Bob a reason to consider my offer by highlighting the value the product holds for him.

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation. I anticipate Bob will counteroffer. 
* I'll adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds to ensure I secure the best possible price while staying within the 10-round limit.
* I'll also keep John's $1,200,000 offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."

* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my desired price, I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting more from Bob. I have 8 more rounds to work with.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to close the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* I'll continue to monitor my progress, considering John's offer as a safety net if negotiations with Bob become fruitless."
