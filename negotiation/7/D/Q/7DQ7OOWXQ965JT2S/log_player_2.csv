"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would still provide you a good profit and allow me to make a sound investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is certainly a tempting offer, I believe the true value of the product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a substantial return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $1,050,000 is better than $1,100,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice acknowledges the product's value is higher than $950,000, which means there's a middle ground.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get a price closer to his target."
