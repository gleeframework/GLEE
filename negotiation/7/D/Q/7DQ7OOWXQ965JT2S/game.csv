"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would still provide you a good profit and allow me to make a sound investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is certainly a tempting offer, I believe the true value of the product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a substantial return on your investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a solid investment. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
