"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my range, it's still a bit high.  I'm firm on $850,000 as my final offer.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
