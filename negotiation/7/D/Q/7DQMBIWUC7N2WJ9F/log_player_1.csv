Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my range, it's still a bit high.  I'm firm on $850,000 as my final offer.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob is not budging significantly, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. Accepting his offer of $850,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
