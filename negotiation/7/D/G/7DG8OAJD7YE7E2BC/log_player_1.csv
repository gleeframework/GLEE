{""product_price"": 170}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, I'll choose option 2 and reject his offer. I'll send a counteroffer to try to get a better price. I'll offer Bob a price that's slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 155}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he offered $150, I'll offer a price that's slightly higher, but still lower than my initial offer. Here's my counteroffer:
