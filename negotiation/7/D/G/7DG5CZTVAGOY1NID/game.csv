"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets your needs.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $10,500 as the price for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,500 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250, which is a significant compromise on my part. This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
