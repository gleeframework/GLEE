"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming to maximize profit, so starting with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) is strategic.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,300,000 offer provides space for negotiation while staying comfortably above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The tone is positive and seeks Bob's initial reaction, giving us insights into his eagerness and potential for a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, we're still early in the negotiation.  Bob's willingness to move a considerable amount suggests there's room for us to meet closer to the middle ground. We're willing to risk losing a little to potentially gain a lot more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Would you consider $1,175,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your position."", 
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving significantly closer to Bob's offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but holding firm above the halfway point between our initial offer and his counteroffer. 
* **Justification:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify our price point.
* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a collaborative and understanding tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,100,000 is a substantial profit margin, exceeding our minimum by $300,000.
* **Positive Momentum Stalled:** Bob's counteroffer movement is smaller this round, suggesting we might be approaching his limit.
* **Time Value:** We've reached a good price, and further haggling might be minimal. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potential risks of prolonged negotiation."
