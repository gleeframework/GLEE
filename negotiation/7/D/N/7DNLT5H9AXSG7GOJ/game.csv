"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? It's still a great deal for you!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still too much for me. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $112.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $118.75?  That way we both get a fair deal, and I can still make a decent profit.",118.75,Alice,5,
