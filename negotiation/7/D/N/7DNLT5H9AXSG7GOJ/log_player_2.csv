Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $112.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $118.75?  That way we both get a fair deal, and I can still make a decent profit.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I'm going to buy the product from John for $100.  While I'm not thrilled about Alice's latest offer, I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like she's not budging much.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially reaching a deal that's still above my target.  I'll take the guaranteed price from John."
