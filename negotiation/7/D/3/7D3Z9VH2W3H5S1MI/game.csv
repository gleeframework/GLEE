,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal for the product's value. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit shy of that price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can agree on it.",10250.0,Bob,4,
