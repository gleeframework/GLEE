"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,800 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,150? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $10,150 is the best price. I'm willing to pay $9,500, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the purchase.",9500.0,Bob,6,
