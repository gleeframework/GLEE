Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm open to further negotiation, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a significant concession on my part. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is unlikely to go substantially lower than $9,000. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is your maximum price."
