Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a reasonable offer considering Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to pique his interest. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize profit:** Starting with a lower price increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer, allowing me to make a quick sale and secure a good profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have room to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** The threat of selling to John for $15,000 serves as a leverage point if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's too low to consider, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. 

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a higher price. This allows me to maintain leverage and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000:**  This counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob a reasonable opportunity to accept while allowing me to secure a better price than his initial offer.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that this is still a good deal despite the higher price. It encourages further negotiation and maintains a positive tone.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** This counteroffer allows me to maintain leverage by demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear lower limit.
* **Explore potential agreement:**  $9,000 is a price that Bob might be willing to consider, particularly if he truly values the product.
* **Prepare for rejection and further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I am prepared to continue negotiating and potentially lower my price further, but always staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, making it more beneficial for me to continue negotiating with Bob to try and reach a higher price. 

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm open to further negotiation, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a significant concession on my part. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:**  This counteroffer is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway, but still maintains a reasonable profit margin for me.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It frames the $10,000 price as a concession on my part, encouraging Bob to see it as a fair offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is advantageous to me.
* **Explore potential agreement:** $10,000 might be a price Bob is willing to accept, especially if he values the product and recognizes the concessions I've made.
* **Prepare for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I am ready to continue negotiating, potentially lowering my price slightly, but always remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
