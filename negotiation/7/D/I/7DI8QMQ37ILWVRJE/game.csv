This price reflects the significant value you'll gain, while allowing me to maximize my return. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we aim for $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I understand your perspective, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price still represents a significant gain for you, while also allowing me to achieve my desired outcome. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
