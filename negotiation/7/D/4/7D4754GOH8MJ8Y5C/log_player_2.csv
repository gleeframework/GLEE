"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth $12,000 to you, and John is also selling it for $12,000, you can reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This doesn't save you money, but it avoids the risk of Alice changing her offer in the future."
