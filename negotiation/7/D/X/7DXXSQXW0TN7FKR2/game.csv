"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,500? This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already willing to give up some profit.",10000.0,Alice,5,
