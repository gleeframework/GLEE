"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $7000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $11000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and still allows me to cover my costs.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting close!  Your offer of $9000 is very tempting, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
