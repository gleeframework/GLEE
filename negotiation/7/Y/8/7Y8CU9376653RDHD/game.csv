"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $850,000 for it.  This would still allow you a healthy profit and hopefully make this a win-win situation. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. Let's try to find a middle ground.",925000.0,Alice,5,
