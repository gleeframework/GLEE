Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than what I'd get from John. I'm going to counter and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering a compromise price, slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not quite there. While I could counter again,  John offers a guaranteed $800,000 which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid further negotiation and secure a known outcome."
