"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 as possible. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,200,000, which gives me a solid fallback position if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I'll use this round to gauge how much more Bob is willing to pay and if he's really committed to closing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000.  This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also mindful of the value of my time. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum, but if Bob continues to stall, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer at $1,250,000  shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm also leaving a small buffer for further negotiation if needed.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll strongly consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob is becoming unproductive.  He's not willing to come close to my minimum, and I'm running out of time.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is more than I'm likely to get from Bob.  To secure the deal and maximize my profit, I'm going to sell the product to John."
