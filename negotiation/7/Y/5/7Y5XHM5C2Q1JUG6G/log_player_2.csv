"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $22,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and he should see if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $22,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in this product but would only be able to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $19,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $19,000 is better than $22,000, it's still far above his budget of $8,000. There's still room for negotiation, and he should see if he can get a better price from Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $19,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your firm stance.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some movement on your end too. How about $16,500? This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,500 is closer to his budget than previous offers, it's still a significant amount more than he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and he should see if he can get a lower price from Alice."
