Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $22,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in this product but would only be able to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $19,000."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $19,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm stance.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some movement on your end too. How about $16,500? This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still above what I can afford.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $11,250, which is halfway between your last offer and my original offer. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his offer.  While going back and forth *might* get you a bit more than $11,250, it's not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
