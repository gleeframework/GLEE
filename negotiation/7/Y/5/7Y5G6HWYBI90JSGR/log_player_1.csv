{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so offering it below this price makes it attractive to him.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80, but aiming higher is always better.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring you make a good profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $80, ensuring you won't be left with the product if Bob declines.

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value while staying above your minimum, you maximize your chances of a successful sale at a favorable price."
