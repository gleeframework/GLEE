"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is attractive, but it's still above the product's worth to her ($1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my intent to negotiate aggressively and hopefully forces Alice to consider a more reasonable price closer to the product's worth to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above the product's worth to her. I'm confident I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still keeping it below the product's worth to Alice. Hopefully, this encourages her to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she will reject my next counteroffer, and we'll be further from a deal. It's likely that I'll be able to negotiate a better price with John, but that comes with a higher cost.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
