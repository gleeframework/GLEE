"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's a truly unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Considering my budget and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

We're still a ways off from a price I'm comfortable with, but there's room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,200,000 is still below what I envisioned, I'm ready to be flexible.  How about we settle at $1,450,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end and keeps the deal within a reasonable range."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,325,000. This is a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product and keeps us both happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

While I could hold out for more, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a substantial profit. Accepting now ensures a successful deal and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or me missing out by going too high."
