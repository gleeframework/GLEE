Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've expressed interest in. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, knowing it's slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the ""great deal"" to entice Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer at $100, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but there's still room for me to get a better price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can push for a higher price by counteroffering. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a buyer for $100 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $90, aiming to find a middle ground closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. That's still a great deal for this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $110 to $95, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's closer to Bob's offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" and the ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** The message invites further discussion, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. That's the maximum I can afford, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Upside:**  While I could counteroffer, it's unlikely that Bob will budge much further.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $100, which is more than Bob's offer. 

**Conclusion:**  It's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John and secure a certain profit than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
