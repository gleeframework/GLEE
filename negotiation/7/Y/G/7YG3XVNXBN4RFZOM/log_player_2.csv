"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is within your budget and a better deal than John's offer. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
