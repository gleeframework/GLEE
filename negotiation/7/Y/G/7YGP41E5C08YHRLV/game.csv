"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $800000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and it's the maximum I can afford. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, considering its worth to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800000 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your honesty. However, considering the product's worth to me is at least $800000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $815000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,5,
