"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for your budget, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $750,000, which is $787,500. I think this is a fair price that balances both of our interests. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise. I see we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one? That puts us at $768,750.  Do you think that would work?",768750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000, which is slightly above your latest offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",785000.0,Alice,7,
