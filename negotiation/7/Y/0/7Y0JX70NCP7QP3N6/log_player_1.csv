"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $7,500 is better than selling to John, I can still do better.  I'll try to meet him in the middle with a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

Bob keeps lowering his offer, and I'm not comfortable going any lower than $8,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $8,000."
