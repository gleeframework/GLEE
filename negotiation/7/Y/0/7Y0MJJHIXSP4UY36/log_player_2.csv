"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is way above my budget. It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I like it, $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) than Alice's initial price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is polite but clear about my budget limitations.  I want to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My goal is to acquire the product for under $100. By starting low, I aim to move the negotiation towards a price point that works for me while staying below my alternative option (buying from John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down in price, but $125 is still significantly more than I'm willing to pay and above my alternative option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to reach a more agreeable price. 

I'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I've increased my offer by $15, showing Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price. 
* **Target Range:** This counteroffer keeps me within my target range (below $100) while aiming for a price point that might be acceptable to both of us.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The message emphasizes fairness and compromise, encouraging Alice to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can offer it to you for $115. That's my best price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice is slowly coming down, $115 is still above my $100 budget and more expensive than buying from John.
* **""Best Price"" Tactic:** Her claim of ""best price"" could be a negotiation tactic. I'm willing to call her bluff and see if she'll budge further.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice won't come down to a reasonable price. 
 
I'll continue negotiating for another round, but I'm getting close to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm still very interested in the product, but $115 is just a bit outside what I can do.  Would you consider $100? That's the top of my budget, and I think it's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is my final offer and matches my absolute maximum budget. It's also my fallback option with John.
* **Direct but Respectful:** I'm being upfront about this being my top price while maintaining a polite and respectful tone. 
* **Decision Point:** This offer will likely determine if I continue negotiating with Alice or take John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $110. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go below $110, which is still above my maximum budget and my alternative option with John.
* **No More Concessions:**  Her language suggests she's firm on this price. 
* **Time to Move On:**  Rather than wasting time on further negotiation, I'll accept John's offer of $100. It's time to cut my losses and get the product at the best available price."
