"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would represent a significant discount from my initial offer and could be a win-win for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but still below your initial asking price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  If this doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'm confident I can find a buyer at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, but I'm still unable to meet you at $1,000,000. I'd like to propose a final price of $980,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",980000.0,Bob,6,
