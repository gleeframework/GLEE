"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than it's worth to you and I'll still be able to get a decent price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $875,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than it's worth to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement here.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $865,000. This is a very fair price, given that you're getting the product for less than it's worth to you. Let's finalize this deal.",865000.0,Alice,5,
