Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $80 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

I will accept Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum price, it's a good outcome, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a worse result."
