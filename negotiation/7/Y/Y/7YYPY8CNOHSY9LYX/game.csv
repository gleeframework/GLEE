"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000. This product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit over my budget at $1,350,000. Would you consider $1,300,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,325,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
