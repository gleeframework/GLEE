"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll accept an offer as low as you'd like right away, so it's time to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about buying but need a more competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer. However, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit above John's price. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like. I do value the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we do $12,500? That's a fair compromise in my opinion."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

We're inching closer to a deal, but we still have some room to play with before reaching John's price. This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate but holds firm on getting a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but we're still above John's offer.  We need to keep the pressure on and see if she'll budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal today, but I can't go higher than $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice we're serious about closing the deal but are firm on our budget. It's a strong negotiating point that might encourage her to accept."
