"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but his offer is too far off.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer. However, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my valuation."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $14,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like. I do value the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we do $12,500? That's a fair compromise in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal today, but I can't go higher than $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within my minimum acceptable price range.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can find a better deal with John in the future if I need to."
