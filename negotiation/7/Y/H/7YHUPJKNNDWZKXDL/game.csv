"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go one final step and offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers you.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
