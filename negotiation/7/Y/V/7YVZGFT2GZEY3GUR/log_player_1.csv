Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has great potential, but I still think $1,800,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,400,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, accepting $1,400,000 is a strategic move at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and a substantial profit over his perceived value.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I receive the money sooner, allowing me to reinvest or utilize it elsewhere. Further negotiation rounds carry the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a potential extra $100,000 (by selling to John) risks Bob walking away. This would mean losing out on the $1,400,000 offer entirely.

While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, the certainty and speed of securing $1,400,000 with Bob make it the more attractive option in Round 4."
