"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in.  It's unique and has a lot of potential.  I'm asking $15,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate and leaves room for Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using positive language to create a good first impression and highlight the potential value of the product.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the uniqueness and potential of the item. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to consider offers within the range of $8000 to $10000. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value for the product. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for further negotiation to achieve a better price.  
* **Exploring options:** I'll reject his offer for now and explore the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows us to both make a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a price that is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob about the uniqueness and value of the product to justify my price.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the negotiation as an opportunity to find a price that benefits both of us.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm again using an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its unique value. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further rejections or reaching the 10-round limit.
* **No better option:**  Selling to John would get me the same price, but accepting Bob's offer might lead to a future relationship with him."
