"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $850,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $25,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $862,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",862500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is getting closer to my budget, $862,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $855,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, as it's still a profitable deal for you while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",855000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $855,000 is getting close to your budget, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $862,500 and $855,000 and offer the product to you for $858,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",858750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $858,750 is still slightly above my budget.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $855,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a win-win for both of us.  Let's wrap this up.",855000.0,Bob,8,
