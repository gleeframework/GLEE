"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm starting with a price of $150.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since I'm willing to pay $150, there's room to potentially save some money.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $150 is a bit steep for me.  How about $120?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget and a good compromise. I'm happy to accept this offer and save $15 compared to buying from John."
