"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is way above what I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'm offering $1,000,000. I'm sure we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,900,000 reflects that more accurately. Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,900,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
