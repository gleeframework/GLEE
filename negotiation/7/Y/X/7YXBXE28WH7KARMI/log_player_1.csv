Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit out of my price range.  How about we settle on $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.
