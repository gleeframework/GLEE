Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  My message highlights the ""deal"" aspect, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, acknowledging that he might need a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's close enough to my minimum) or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If negotiations stall: I'll switch to John and sell the product for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also far below my initial offer, which indicates Bob is trying to lowball me. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price closer to my desired value. 
* **John is a backup:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's lowball offer.

**Next Step:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still give you a great deal on the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price, showing flexibility.  $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's offer and within a reasonable range for both parties.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to incentivize him to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, stating that I'm willing to find a ""middle ground.""

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I will analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $1,050,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll lower his offer further or the negotiation will drag on. 
* **Time is money:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale and move on. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and move on to the next potential deal."
