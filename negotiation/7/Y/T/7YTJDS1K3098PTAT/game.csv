"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
