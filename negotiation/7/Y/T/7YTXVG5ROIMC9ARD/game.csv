"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 might still be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $11,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
