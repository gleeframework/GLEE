"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let me know if that works for you.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150.  This is a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
