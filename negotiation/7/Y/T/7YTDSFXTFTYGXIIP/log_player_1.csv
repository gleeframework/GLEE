Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your return, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'll offer $1,500,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.
