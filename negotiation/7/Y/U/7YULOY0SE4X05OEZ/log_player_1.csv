Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $82.50 is a decent compromise and gets me closer to my goal.  It's also better than selling to John for $80."
