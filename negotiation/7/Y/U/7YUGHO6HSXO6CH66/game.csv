"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $825000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be willing to negotiate further.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than $800000. I think the product is worth every penny, and I'm not willing to compromise further. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium support package and a 6-month warranty. I'm still firm on the price of $800000.",800000.0,Alice,7,
