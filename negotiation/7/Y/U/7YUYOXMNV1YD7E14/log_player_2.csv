"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject the offer and negotiate a lower price. You can use the information that the product is worth $12,000 to Alice as leverage in your counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also want to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's important to continue negotiating to reach a price that's acceptable to both of you.  You have more rounds to work with, so you can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but $10,000 is the highest I can go right now. This would still give you a decent profit, and would allow me to make the purchase work financially. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I want to make this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I need to get from this sale. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's final offer of $12,000 is still above your budget. You have a guaranteed alternative with John who is willing to sell the product for $8,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal."
