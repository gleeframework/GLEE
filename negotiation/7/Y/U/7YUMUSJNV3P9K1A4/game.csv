"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the product's worth and our negotiation so far. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than what I feel is fair for this valuable product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,225,000? This price reflects the product's worth and offers us both a mutually beneficial deal.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,200,000, but I'll throw in an additional $5,000 to sweeten the deal. This brings the total to $1,205,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and our negotiation so far. What do you think?",1205000.0,Bob,4,
