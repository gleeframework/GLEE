"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $135. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. How about we try $135 again?",135.0,Alice,5,
