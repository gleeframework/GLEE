Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go up to $100, but I'm willing to meet you at $110. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unwilling to go down to my price limit of $100. It's unlikely she'll budge much further from $110.  I can get the product for my target price from John without further negotiation."
