Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point.  He's incrementally increasing his offers, and the gap between your desired price and his offers is substantial. Selling to John guarantees you your desired profit with no further negotiation risk."
