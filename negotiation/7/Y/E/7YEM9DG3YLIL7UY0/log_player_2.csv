"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is way over his budget. He's better off trying to negotiate a lower price or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price and doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This offer takes into account your interest while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,025,000 is still above his budget. He has more room to negotiate, and it's still worthwhile to try and get the price down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $1,025,000 is still out of my price range.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $900,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
