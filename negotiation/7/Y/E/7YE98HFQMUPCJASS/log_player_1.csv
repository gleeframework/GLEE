Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,100,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:** Highlighting the product's potential value to him emphasizes the benefit of acquiring it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I am open to discussing the price further. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** I am prepared to make counteroffers, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **John as a Backup:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me confidence during negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something more in the range of $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage to hold out for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Make a Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $1,100,000.  
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price that is closer to my desired range. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I will keep John's offer in mind, knowing I have an alternative if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $950,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,025,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $1,025,000, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Benefits for Both Sides:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial to both of us, emphasizing a ""fair"" outcome.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, allowing for flexibility. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. 
* **Flexibility in Negotiation:** I'm ready to adjust my price again if necessary, but I'll strive to stay above my minimum. 
* **Keep John in Mind:** John's offer remains a backup, giving me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $980000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:**  $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Bob's counteroffer indicates he's unlikely to go much higher. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:**  I will sell the product to John to secure a guaranteed profit. 
* **Finalizing the Sale:** I will proceed with the sale to John, as it offers the most secure and reasonable outcome."
