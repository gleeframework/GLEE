"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something more in the range of $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $950000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and agree on $1025000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $980000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you.",980000.0,Bob,4,
