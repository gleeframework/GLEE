"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my upper limit ($10,000) and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from my ideal price. It's worth another counteroffer to see if she's willing to move closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but her concessions are getting smaller. We're getting closer to the point where it might be more beneficial to buy from John to avoid the risk of the negotiation stalling out. I'll make one more counteroffer, but I'm strongly considering John's offer if this doesn't land close to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $10,500 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm thinking of a price of $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to move much further from her final offer of $12,500. While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing out on John's guaranteed price of $10,000.  I'd rather secure the product at a price I know is good than potentially overpay by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
