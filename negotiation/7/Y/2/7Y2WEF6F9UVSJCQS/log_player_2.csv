"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is selling the product for $11,500, which is less than John's price of $12,000.
* **You're still within your budget:** The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
