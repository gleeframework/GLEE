Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident this offer reflects that. How does $1,150,000 sound?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price above Alice's minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob to be a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, she might start slightly lower to avoid turning him away immediately.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though Alice has a backup buyer, maintaining a good relationship with Bob could be valuable for future business. The tone of her message aims to be collaborative rather than purely transactional."
