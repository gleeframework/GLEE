Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. This offer allows you to still make a significant profit while being more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and still allows you to profit comfortably.
