"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $12,000. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I would like to propose a price of $18,000 for it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a proposal that could work for both of us. How about considering a price of $14,500 for the product? This is higher than what you offered, yet still lower than my initial proposal. I hope this can be a fair compromise.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the product's value and your budget, how about we aim for a price of $14,000? This is a bit closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's worth. I hope this can be agreeable to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? This way, we both get a fair deal.",13750.0,Bob,6,
