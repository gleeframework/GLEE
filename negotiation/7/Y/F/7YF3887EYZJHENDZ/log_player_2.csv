"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?  It's a fair price and would be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  How about we settle at $10,000?  That's the top end of my budget, and I believe it's a fair deal considering its true value."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is the top end of your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its original value and the effort I've put into the negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has shown she is unwilling to budge below $11,000. It's unlikely she'll suddenly drop to $10,000.  Cutting my losses and buying from John guarantees I get the product at my target price."
