"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?  It's a fair price and would be a mutually beneficial deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  How about we settle at $10,000?  That's the top end of my budget, and I believe it's a fair deal considering its true value.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is the top end of your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its original value and the effort I've put into the negotiation.",11250.0,Alice,5,
