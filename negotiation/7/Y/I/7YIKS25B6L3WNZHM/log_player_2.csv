"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $100.

You have three options:

Let's start the negotiation a good bit lower than Alice's offer.  This leaves room for negotiation and signals I'm looking for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'd like to counter your offer at $85. This is higher than my initial offer, but still below what you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $85 is better than the initial offer, it's still too high. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $70."

We're inching closer to a potential deal. By suggesting a specific price that's a compromise between our previous offers, it might encourage Alice to make a more significant move towards our desired price range."

This is a great deal! Alice agreed to our compromise price of $77, which is a significant saving compared to both her initial offer and buying from John."
