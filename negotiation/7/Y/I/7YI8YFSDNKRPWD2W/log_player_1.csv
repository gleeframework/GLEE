"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to show you I'm serious about selling to you. This is a great price for such a valuable product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get a little more, $13,250 is a good deal, especially considering the risk of negotiating further and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
