"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business.  While I can't disclose specifics without a non-disclosure agreement, I can assure you this product is worth at least $1200000 to me.  I'm confident it could be even more valuable for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1500000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she claims the product is worth at least that much to her, you have no way to verify this. You're better off rejecting the offer and buying from John for your maximum price."
