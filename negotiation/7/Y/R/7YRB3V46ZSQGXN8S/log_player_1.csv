Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $2,025,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is valuable, but $2,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000. This is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:

While $1,900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000.

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,925,000 is a strong one. Accepting ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale by pushing too hard."
