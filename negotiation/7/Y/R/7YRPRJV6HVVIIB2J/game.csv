"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know you'll find immense value in it. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential value, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and outlining your perspective. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  Could you consider $1,300,000? This feels like a fairer compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving up on your offer.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
