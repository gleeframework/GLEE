Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Being polite:** Starting with a friendly greeting sets a positive tone. 
* **Being reasonable:** $13,000 is a good starting point,  leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit above my minimum.
* **Highlighting benefits:** Emphasizing ""great deal for both of us"" frames the offer as win-win, encouraging Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is close to my minimum desired profit.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $10,000. Accepting this offer secures a sale and allows me to move on."
