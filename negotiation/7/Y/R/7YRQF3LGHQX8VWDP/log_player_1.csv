Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My primary goal is to earn the highest possible price for the product. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I need to aim significantly higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Anchoring Bias:** Starting with a high offer like $19,000 sets an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the initial high price might lead him to accept a higher final price than if I started lower.
* **Perceived Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value without being overly specific about its features. This allows Bob to justify a higher price in his mind based on his own assessment of its worth.
* **Downside Protection:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $10,000 offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. Bob could be turned off by the high initial price and refuse to negotiate. However, the potential reward of selling it for significantly more than $10,000 makes this a risk worth taking."
