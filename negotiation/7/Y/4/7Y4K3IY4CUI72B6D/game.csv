"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested in my product.  While I understand your budget, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it to make sense for me.  Would you be open to that?",11500.0,Alice,3,
