Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price, considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $12,000, I allow for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately reaching my minimum price. 
* **Maintaining Options:** I haven't set a hard limit on my price, allowing me to adjust if necessary. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to walk away if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is below my minimum price of $15,000, so accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without being pressured to accept an unfavorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested in my product.  While I understand your budget, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it to make sense for me.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price of $11,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.  This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $11,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  I've stated that I need to get at least $11,500, making it clear that I won't accept anything lower.
* **Open to further discussion:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm still not able to go above $10,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on his $10,000 offer, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **John's offer is significantly better:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might ultimately fail.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would consume time and potentially delay the sale, while John is a guaranteed sale at a much more favorable price."
