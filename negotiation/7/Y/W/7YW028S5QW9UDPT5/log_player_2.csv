"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is way above his budget of $10,000. He has room to negotiate and should try to get the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $10,000.  Let's start with that figure and see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $13,500. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his $10,000 limit. He has more negotiation rounds and can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,500? It's still a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget of $10,000.  John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, and with only 5 rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice."
