"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $10,000.  Let's start with that figure and see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $13,500. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,500? It's still a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality.",12500.0,Alice,5,
