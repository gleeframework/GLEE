Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $250,000 surplus he'd gain from buying it.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $800,000, ensuring a profit even if you have to go with John.
* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:** By offering the product at $1,250,000, you're aiming for a price that's highly profitable for you while still leaving Bob with a compelling reason to buy ($250,000 potential gain). 

This strategy maximizes your chances of closing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable offer."
