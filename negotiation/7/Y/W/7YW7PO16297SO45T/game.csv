"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer. $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $8,000. Would you do $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think the product is worth more than $7,800. I can meet you at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",8500.0,Alice,7,
