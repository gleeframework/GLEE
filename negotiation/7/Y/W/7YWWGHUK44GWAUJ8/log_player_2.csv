"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,500 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a bit lower than her initial offer, $10,200 is still a bit too high for Bob. He can likely negotiate a better price by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $10,200 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than Alice's previous offer, $9,750 is still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and he could potentially get a better deal if he continues to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer you $9,250. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to close this deal without either of us feeling like we've lost out."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,250 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Alice has lowered her price to $9,500, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal for both of them.  It's better than waiting for another round and risking that Alice will reject his counteroffer again, or going to John and paying $12,000."
