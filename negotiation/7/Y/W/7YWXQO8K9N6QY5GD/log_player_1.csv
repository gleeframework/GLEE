"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high baseline for the negotiation and allows for room to adjust downwards if necessary.  I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
