"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I know it's worth $800,000 to you, so this is a significant advantage. Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's $900,000 offer."
