,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $950000 is below what I can accept at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1050000 to make this work. This price still gives you a great deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  $980000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1015000.  This price is a good compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1015000.0,Alice,5,

This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find this deal very worthwhile.
