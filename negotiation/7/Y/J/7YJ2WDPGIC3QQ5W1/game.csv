"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has valuable features, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  That's a substantial increase from my last offer and demonstrates I'm serious about making this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,
