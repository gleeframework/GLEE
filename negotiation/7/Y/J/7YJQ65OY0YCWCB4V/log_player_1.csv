"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $10,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

While $11,000 is closer to my goal, I still feel I can get a bit more.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. How about $11,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, I still believe I can get a slightly better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference.  How about $11,350? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting pretty close. I'd be willing to go to $11,250.  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're very close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal. It's better to take the $11,250 now than to risk getting less in the next round or having to sell to John for a lower price."
