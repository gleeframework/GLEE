"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $12,000. This is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
