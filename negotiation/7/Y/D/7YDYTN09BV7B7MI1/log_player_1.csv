Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $120, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still go lower, but you're starting strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and get closer to your desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $130?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $115? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $115 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is more than what Bob is currently offering. It's more beneficial to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
