"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and more than my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
