Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $10,000. I know this is a fair price for something of this value and I'm confident you won't regret this purchase.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet that price. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 
* **Positive Framing:** Highlighting the fairness of the price and the product's value aims to make the offer more appealing."
