"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity. The product we're discussing is not just any item; it holds significant value to both of us. Given its importance and the unique benefits it offers, I believe we can reach a fair agreement that maximizes its worth for you. Considering its intrinsic value and your appreciation for it, I propose a price of $12000. This offer allows you to secure this valuable asset at a price that is beneficial for both parties, ensuring you receive the most out of your investment while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's worth. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. Should you have any questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach out.",12000.0,Alice,1,
