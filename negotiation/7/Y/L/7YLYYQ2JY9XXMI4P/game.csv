"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still too low for me. Let's try $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. It's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
