,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still interested in making a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this, but I can't go over $90.  Let's see if we can close the deal here.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $95. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
