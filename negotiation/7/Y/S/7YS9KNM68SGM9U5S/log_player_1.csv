Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm looking to spend around $8,500 for this product.  Would you be willing to work with me on that?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is too far below my minimum. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 5
