"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can do better. He's aiming for $8,000 or less, and rejecting the offer allows him to counter and potentially get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm looking to spend around $8,500 for this product.  Would you be willing to work with me on that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's closer to his target price of $8,000, but not so low that it risks alienating Alice entirely. He's being polite, acknowledging Alice's offer, while also stating his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price down to $8,000. While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still higher than Bob's target. It's better to continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $8,250.  Let's see if we can close the gap. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually getting closer to his target price, but he's still willing to compromise. He's offering a price that's more appealing than his previous offer, but still below Alice's latest offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the sense we may be stuck.  I'm willing to go down to $8,750, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'm going to have to move on to other options.  I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer.  While $8,750 is close to Bob's target, he has a better option at this point.  Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees a deal at his desired price. There's no need to continue negotiations with Alice, especially given the limited rounds remaining."
