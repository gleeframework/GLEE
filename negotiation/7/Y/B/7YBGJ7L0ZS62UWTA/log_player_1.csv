"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While $100 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125, which is halfway between my minimum price of $120 and Bob's offer of $100. This should show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $115. It's a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and hopefully shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  We're running out of rounds and it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will meet my price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
