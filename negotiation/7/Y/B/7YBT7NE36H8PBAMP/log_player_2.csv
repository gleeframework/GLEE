"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you, and a profitable sale for me.  Let me know if you're interested. I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John at a price that fits his budget."
