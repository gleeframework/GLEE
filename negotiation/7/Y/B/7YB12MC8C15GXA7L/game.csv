"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,500. This is my top price, so let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll come down to $10,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800, and I truly believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I can accept. I'll come down to $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to sell the product for. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
