"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is too expensive at $1,300,000, exceeding Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. It's also worth noting that buying from John is always a safe option, but Bob wants to try and get a better price than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $400,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate.  This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  Buying from John is always a backup option, but it's better to try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise but still pushing for a good deal.  $950,000 is a reasonable offer that's still within his budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  It also gives Alice a bit more to work with, potentially leading to a faster agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get a better price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to his budget, there's still room for negotiation.  He can likely get the price down closer to $1,000,000 by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering the price John is willing to sell for. This signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good price and is almost ready to walk away if she doesn't meet his offer.  This puts pressure on Alice to either accept and close the deal or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point.  With only three rounds left, the time to negotiate is dwindling. While Bob could continue to try and negotiate with Alice, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high. Buying from John for $1,000,000 ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further potential delays or failures in negotiation."
