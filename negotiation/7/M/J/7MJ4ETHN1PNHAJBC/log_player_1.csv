Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  I start with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $150 offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aiming for a good profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer at $100, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. I won't immediately settle for less than I can get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own stated value of the product. It's clear he's trying to negotiate a bargain. By rejecting this low offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $75 is significantly below its value.  I could consider $130, which is a more reasonable offer."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Conciliatory Step:** I'm lowering my price by $20, showing willingness to negotiate, but not drastically.  This keeps me well above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that his offer is significantly below value, I'm subtly reminding him that he's the one who needs to move closer to a reasonable price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth and leaves me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's Value:** Bob has now offered his perceived value of the product ($100). It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Matching John's Offer:** Accepting Bob's offer means I'll be selling the product for the same price John is offering. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away. It's best to secure a sure sale at this point."
