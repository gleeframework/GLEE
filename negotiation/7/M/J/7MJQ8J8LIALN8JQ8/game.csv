"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential return on investment. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to counter with $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
