Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed sale at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit, ideally above your minimum.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while still exceeding your minimum.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, there's no need to go below $1,500,000.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations.  I'm offering it to you at a premium price of $1,700,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but the message positions it as a premium product. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. This allows you to potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still well above your minimum price.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
