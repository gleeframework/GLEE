Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob ($100) but leaving room for negotiation. I'm being friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While $100 is my minimum, I can likely get more. I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $105 as the price for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  While it's not the $120 I initially hoped for, it's above my minimum of $100 and closer to the product's value to Bob.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
