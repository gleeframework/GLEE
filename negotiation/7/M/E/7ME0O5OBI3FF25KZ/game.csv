"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1200000 to you. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my own. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1100000? This would still leave you a substantial profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my desired price. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1075000. However, I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $1087500? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. Let's get this deal done!",1087500.0,Alice,5,
