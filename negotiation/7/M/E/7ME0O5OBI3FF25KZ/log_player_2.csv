"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1200000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my own. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1100000? This would still leave you a substantial profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price. However, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a price closer to his target, potentially securing an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1075000. However, I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $1087500? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and is now within a reasonable range of Bob's desired price.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a good price, saving Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John.  There's a risk of pushing further and getting a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or not getting a better offer in the remaining rounds is higher. It's a smart move to accept and secure the deal."
