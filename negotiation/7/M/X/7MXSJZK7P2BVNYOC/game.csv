"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16500. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15500.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $15500. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,5,
