{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay a premium for this product, and this initial offer sets the stage for a fruitful discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  How about we start the conversation at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept an offer that undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $750,000 is the lowest I can go at this time.  It reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value and a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate might yield a higher price, but it risks losing the deal entirely, and I'm confident this is a reasonable offer."
