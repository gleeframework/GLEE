"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $11,500 is close to your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to purchase from John at a slightly higher but still acceptable price."
