Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay closer to my initial offer of $11,000.  What do you think about that?

Bob seems pretty set on $11,000, and it's unlikely he'll go much higher.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000."
