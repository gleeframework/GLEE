"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and it's priced competitively considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I want to try to get closer to the $1,400,000 I initially offered.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or secure the $1,000,000 from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is within my acceptable range and significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. It's a good compromise that allows me to secure a profitable deal.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer and closing the deal with Bob."
