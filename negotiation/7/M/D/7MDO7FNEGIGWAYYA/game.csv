,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is way below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to make a profit.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good deal, Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about we try $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $75 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I can do $80, but that's absolutely my limit.",80.0,Bob,6,
