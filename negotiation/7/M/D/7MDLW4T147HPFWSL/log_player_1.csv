Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob than to me, but is still below the perceived value of $15,000 he places on it. This initial offer allows for a potential win-win scenario, maximizing my earnings while still appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price, it is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to counter with a higher price. This will give me the chance to secure a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It's still a profitable deal for me, and it shows flexibility in the negotiation, potentially leading to a faster agreement."
