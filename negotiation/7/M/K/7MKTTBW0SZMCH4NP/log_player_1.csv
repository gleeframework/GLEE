Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $850,000 is too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant benefit and allows me to secure a fair price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can negotiate a higher price.  I have more rounds and can risk a few more rejections before needing to settle for John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one more concession and come down to $890,000. This is a very fair price, considering the significant value the product brings to you.  Let's aim for a deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can we meet at $880,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, the risk of further rejection is too high, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale above my minimum and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
