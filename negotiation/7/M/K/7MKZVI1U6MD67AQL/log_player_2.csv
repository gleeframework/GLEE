Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $107.50. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's preferred price. He'll continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target price of $105."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $105. I really think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $106.75. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106.75

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his target price of $105. While $106.75 isn't ideal, it's a fair price considering the value the product has for him and the potential of the deal falling through.  He's willing to accept a small compromise to avoid the risk of going to John and paying $120."
