Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting high to gauge your interest and leave room for negotiation. Even if you don't accept this initial offer, it gives us a starting point for discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $160 is more than my minimum price of $150. Accepting is the best option right now.
