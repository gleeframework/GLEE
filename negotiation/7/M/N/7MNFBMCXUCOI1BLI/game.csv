"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,120,000?",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
