"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, $900000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this unique product.  How about we meet in the middle at $950000?  This would still represent a significant saving for you compared to its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $920000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
