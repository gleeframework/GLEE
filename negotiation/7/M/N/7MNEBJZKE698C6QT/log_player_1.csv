Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer ($1,000,000) as a negotiating tactic. This gives me room to come down in price if necessary. 
* **Focus on value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value and potential benefits to Bob's business. This is meant to pique his interest and make him consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By not immediately offering the minimum acceptable price, I'm allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation, which could potentially result in a higher final price.
* **John as a safety net:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $800,000, which sets a floor for my acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough:** While $900,000 is better than my minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly below the initial offer of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob's offer shows he's interested and willing to pay a substantial amount. This indicates a good chance for further negotiation.
* **Potential for higher price:** There's still room to push for a higher price, especially if I can further emphasize the product's unique value to Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and continue to negotiate towards a price that is more beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this unique product.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would still represent a significant saving for you compared to its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for your business."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but reasonable:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer outright, but I'm also not going back to my initial high price. This shows I'm flexible but still value the product.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Proposing $950,000 represents a compromise, making it seem like a fair and reasonable price.
* **Reiterating value:**  I continue to highlight the product's unique value and its potential to be a strong asset for Bob's business.
* **Leaving room for a final agreement:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $920000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to your product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is only $20,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $900,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially drag out the process and risk Bob losing interest altogether.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer could open the door to future collaborations or purchases.

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a good deal and avoid the potential risks of further negotiation."
