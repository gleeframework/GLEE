{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,100,000. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its significant value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation while staying above your minimum allows you to maximize your potential profit. 

By offering the product at $1,100,000, Bob gets a $100,000 discount, making it a very attractive deal for him. At the same time, you secure a profit of $300,000, which is significantly better than the $800,000 you'd get from John."
