,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $140? It's a compromise that works for me, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $130. Would you be willing to compromise?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $135? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $127.50. Would you be willing to accept this price?",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $127.50 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. How about we meet at $132? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to close the deal.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $132 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $126. Would you be willing to accept this price?",126.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to close the deal. How about we meet at $129? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",129.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $129 is still a bit too high for me. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll offer you one last chance to meet me at $125. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",125.0,Bob,10,
