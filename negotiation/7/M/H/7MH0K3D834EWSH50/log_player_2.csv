"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. Let's start with a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but lower than your counteroffer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and meet at $8,750.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
