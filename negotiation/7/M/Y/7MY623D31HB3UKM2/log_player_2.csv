"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price, so rejecting and providing a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd consider."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation strategy often involves starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $6,000, we're setting a low anchor. This might influence Alice's perception of the product's value during the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  Our offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, giving us space to gradually increase our bid if needed while staying within our budget.

It's a risky move, but it could pay off if Alice is motivated to sell quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice significantly lowered her price, which is a good sign. However, her current offer is still higher than John's offer. By rejecting and countering again, we can try to negotiate an even better price or comfortably settle for John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can expedite the negotiation process.
* **Staying Below John's Offer:**  Our proposed price is still slightly below John's offer, ensuring we're getting a better deal if Alice accepts.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  While we could continue negotiating in smaller increments, there's a risk of Alice becoming frustrated or us losing the opportunity for a good deal.  This offer attempts to find a balance quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is now firm at $8,500, which is higher than John's offer of $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not budging further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to accept John's guaranteed offer and secure the product at the best possible price."
