"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8500.0,Alice,5,
