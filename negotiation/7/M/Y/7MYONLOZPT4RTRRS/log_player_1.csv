Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Consider the Backup Offer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. We don't want to price it too high and risk Bob rejecting the offer. 

This strategy aims for a win-win situation where both Alice and Bob benefit."
