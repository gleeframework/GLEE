"Alice, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is too low for me. This product is very valuable, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from another seller if we can't agree.",15000.0,Bob,4,
