"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $11,500, since you're willing to pay up to $12,000 and the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation and is higher than the product's value to Alice. This allows for a potential deal while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, and you have more rounds to try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but it's still too high. This counteroffer increases your offer by $500, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price. This should encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has jumped above your maximum price. You can get the product from John for a lower price. It's better to secure the product from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
