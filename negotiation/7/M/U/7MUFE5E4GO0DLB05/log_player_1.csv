"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $9,500."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer isn't the absolute maximum ($10,000), allowing Bob to feel like he could negotiate a slightly better deal.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below both my minimum ($8,000) and his perceived value ($10,000). Accepting would leave a lot of money on the table.
* **Early stage:** It's only round 2, and I have room to negotiate. Rejecting this low offer signals that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **John is a backup:** Knowing I have John's offer provides a safety net, allowing me to confidently reject Bob's lowball offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $8,750."", ""product_price"": 8750}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer firmly but proposing a counteroffer that shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price, but it's still comfortably above my minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Anchoring:** By offering a new high point ($8,750), I'm attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $8,200 is above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and provides a reasonable profit. 
* **Bob's Upper Limit?:** Bob has increased his offer twice, suggesting he may be getting closer to his upper limit.
* **Time Value:**  While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation, closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
