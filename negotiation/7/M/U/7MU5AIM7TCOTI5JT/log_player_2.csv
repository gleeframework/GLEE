"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know your decision. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to create a false sense of urgency by claiming she'll sell it for less if you decline.  This is likely a negotiating tactic. You know John will sell it to you for $1,200,000, so you have a fallback option. By rejecting Alice's offer, you give yourself a chance to negotiate a better price or see if she'll come down to her actual value of $1,000,000."
