It's a good deal, but you can likely do better.  Let's see what Alice's counteroffer is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $5,000 is a reasonable starting point, and if she's truly motivated to sell, she might be willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still not as good as I'd like. I'll try to get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, to $5,500.  It's a compromise, but still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but I'm not willing to pay $7,000 yet. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm going to offer $6,000. It's a good compromise and hopefully, Alice will accept it.  If she doesn't, I'm ready to buy from John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price, and we're running out of rounds. To avoid the risk of running out of time and having to pay the full $8,000, I'll go with John's offer."
