"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a decent price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's only $5 less than my last offer.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate, especially since John will buy it for $120."
