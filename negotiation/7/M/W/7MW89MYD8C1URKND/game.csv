"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $600,000. I'm willing to consider a price closer to what I initially offered, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I've already gone quite far in meeting you halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
