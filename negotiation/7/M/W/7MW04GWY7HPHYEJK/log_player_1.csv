Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $700,000 is better than my floor price, I believe I can do better with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum price.  Accepting his offer is the best option, as I will get my minimum and avoid further negotiation."
