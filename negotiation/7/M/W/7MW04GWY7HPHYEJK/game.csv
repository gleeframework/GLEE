"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its potential.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Would you consider $900,000?  This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us while recognizing the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
