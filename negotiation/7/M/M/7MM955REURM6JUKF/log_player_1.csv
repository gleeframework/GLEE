Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong position to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so aiming higher is logical.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000), you anchor the negotiation in your favor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price well above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting your initial offer. You have a strong fallback option with John."
