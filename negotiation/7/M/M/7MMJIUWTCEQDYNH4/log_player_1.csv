"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still secure a profit that's close to my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and opportunity of the product. This helps to create a positive initial impression and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a backup. By starting high, I hope to get Bob to counter with a lower offer, which will then allow me to gradually work towards a price that benefits me without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1200000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can show Bob that I'm serious about getting a price that's closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique value and its potential for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the product's value and potential. This helps to justify the price and hopefully persuade Bob to move closer to my desired range.
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes that my counteroffer represents a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to slowly but steadily bring the price closer to my desired range while maintaining a positive negotiation tone. By showing flexibility and willingness to compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to come closer to my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Therefore, I will reject his offer and continue negotiating in hopes of securing a higher price.

**Strategy:**

While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my desired price through negotiation with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for anything less than my minimum.  I'm hoping this will lead to a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price reflects both the value of the product and the need to find a solution that works for us both. Let's find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's current offer of $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Emphasizing Value and Solution:** The message reiterates the value of the product and the importance of finding a solution. This helps to reinforce the idea that this deal is beneficial for both parties.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to find a price that both parties are comfortable with, while remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This approach aims to build trust and encourage a successful negotiation. I'm hoping that this offer, along with the positive tone, will lead Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still below $1,000,000. I am unwilling to sell for anything less than my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

I am choosing to continue negotiations with Bob in hopes of getting a better price. I will continue to counteroffer and try to reach a deal that is closer to my desired price. However, I am aware of the risk of losing the deal to Bob and will be prepared to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to a deal!  I'm going to make one final concession. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,000,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** This counteroffer emphasizes that this is my absolute bottom line. It signals a clear commitment to the deal while also pushing Bob towards my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value and Potential:** The message highlights the value and potential of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he stands to gain by closing the deal. 
* **Closing the Deal:** The message uses language that encourages closure and emphasizes the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

This round is crucial. I'm making a final concession to show my willingness to find common ground. My hope is that Bob will either accept this offer or counter with a price just slightly higher than my minimum.  If he rejects, I will proceed with selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to close the deal.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite Bob's willingness to compromise, his offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have made significant concessions already and I'm not willing to go any lower.  

**Strategy:**

With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  It's time to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John for $1,000,000.  This is a better outcome than risking further negotiation and possibly ending up with nothing."
