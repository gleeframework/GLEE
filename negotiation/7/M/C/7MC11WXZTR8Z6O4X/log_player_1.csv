Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another party."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower ($950,000) with Bob allows room to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another interested buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Highlighting:**  Instead of focusing solely on price, I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential to pique Bob's interest.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
