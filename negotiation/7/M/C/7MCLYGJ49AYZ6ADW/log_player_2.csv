"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is still a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $13,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price than John's offer, there's still potential for further negotiation.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and Bob should try one more counteroffer to see if he can secure a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not getting the price I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated that $13,250 is her final offer, and this is still higher than Bob's preferred price. With only three rounds remaining, Bob doesn't have much leverage to negotiate further.  It's in his best interest to buy from John at $15,000, as he's unlikely to get a better deal from Alice within the remaining time."
