"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $120 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its quality and your appreciation for it. Considering my cost and the market value, I suggest we aim for a price around $100. This would ensure a reasonable profit for me while still providing you with a significant savings compared to its retail value. Let's discuss further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",100.0,Alice,1,
