"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$6,500 is a good price**, but there's room for negotiation, especially since you have 10 rounds. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to gain more information.**  You can see how much Alice is willing to drop the price before you have to resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  $5,000 is a bold move, but it forces Alice to reveal if she's seriously interested in selling at a price lower than her initial offer.  
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving room to negotiate upwards if Alice is willing to play ball."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:**  She's dropped the price to $6,000, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still room for improvement:** $6,000 is still above my ideal price, and I have rounds remaining.  
* **Gathering information:** I want to see if Alice is willing to go lower than $6,000 before making a decision."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  I'm increasing my offer from $5,000 to $5,500, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $5,500, I'm putting the pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to meet me halfway or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being stubborn:** She's only moved down $250 from her previous offer, indicating she's holding firm.
* **Still room for negotiation:**  I can still get a better deal, as $6,250 is significantly higher than my ideal price.
* **Gaining information:** I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further before making a decision."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  This counteroffer is halfway between Alice's last offer of $6,250 and my previous offer of $5,500. 
* **Showing compromise:** It demonstrates that I am actively trying to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Pressure tactic:** By offering a slightly higher price, I am putting pressure on Alice to accept before she risks losing the deal. 
* **Still below my limit:**  $5,750 is still significantly lower than my maximum budget of $12,000, so I have room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close:** While $6,375 is not my ideal price, it's much closer to my desired range.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  I only have 3 rounds left, and I don't want to risk running out of time and having to pay John's much higher price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even if I accept this offer, there's still a chance I can negotiate a lower price in future rounds.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of having to pay John's higher price, even though it's not my ideal outcome."
