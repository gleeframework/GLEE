"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $850,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering both our goals.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $887,500? This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
