"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $850,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering both our goals."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $925,000 is better than John's price, he believes he can still negotiate a lower price. He has several rounds left and can leverage the fact that Alice is eager to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $887,500? This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob still wants to save more money, Alice's offer of $912,500 is getting closer to his target.  He has already gone through several rounds and doesn't want to risk getting stuck with a higher price from John.  Additionally, with five rounds remaining, he still has time to potentially negotiate further in the future if needed."
