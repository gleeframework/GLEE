"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I know it will be worth it to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price, closer to her perceived value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation while staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we're still not there yet. I'm confident I can get her closer to $9,000 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice that I am willing to compromise, but also that I'm serious about getting a good price.  It's getting closer to my limit, but still leaves some wiggle room if needed."
