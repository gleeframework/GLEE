"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a significant departure from my initial asking price.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the true value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still more than I'm able to pay.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
