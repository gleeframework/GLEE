"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too far below the product's true worth.  I'm willing to be flexible, however, and I'd like to propose a compromise.  How about we settle on $1350000? This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.  Let's reach an agreement and make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $1250000? This is the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1250000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This reflects a compromise on both our ends and allows us to move forward. I truly believe this product can be a valuable asset for your business, and I'm confident we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $1225000? This is the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $1225000 is still significantly below what I believe it's worth.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1275000.  This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives. Let's finalize this deal and make this happen for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
