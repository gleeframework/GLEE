{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  You're still making a profit over your minimum of $10,000.
* **Below Bob's value:** Bob still sees value in the product at this price. This makes him more likely to accept or counteroffer. 
* **Allows for negotiation:**  It gives Bob room to counteroffer without you feeling pressured to accept a lower price immediately. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially hoped for.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer, perhaps $12,000, to see if you can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to your initial asking price.  While it's not ideal, it's still a decent profit over your minimum of $10,000.  Accepting his offer is a good way to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiation."
