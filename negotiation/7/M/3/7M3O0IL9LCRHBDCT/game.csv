"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Considering the value of the product, I'm prepared to lower my price to $15,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",13500.0,Bob,4,
