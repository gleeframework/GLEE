"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could make this work for $725,000.  Let me know if that's feasible.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to think that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this works for you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
