"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is worth no more than $100 to you. Alice is offering the product at $100. This means there's no potential for you to save money by accepting her offer. Since you can buy the product from John for the same price, it's better to reject Alice's offer.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future, but at this point, there's no benefit to accepting."
