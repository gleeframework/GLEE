Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price, even if I have to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.

While $8,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to come up to $8,750? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,750. I'd like to propose $8,500 again, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and $8,750, which would be $8,625. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,625

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,625.  This is getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. It's important to balance getting the best price with the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
