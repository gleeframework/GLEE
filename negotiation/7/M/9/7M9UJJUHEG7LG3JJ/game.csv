"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the significant benefit it offers you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price of $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still provides you with substantial value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to make a healthy profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
