Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? This is still a substantial discount from my initial price and a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $1300000 to make this worthwhile. If you're serious about purchasing this product, I believe this is the best we can do. Let me know if you're willing to budge a little.

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy from John for $800,000."
