Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, Bob values the product at $15,000. This presents an opportunity to negotiate a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you. It's a strong starting point within the negotiation range. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer, allowing you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
