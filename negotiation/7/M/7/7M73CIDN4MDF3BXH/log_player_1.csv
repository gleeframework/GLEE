Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, without revealing your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value, it doesn't completely shut down the possibility of him negotiating down. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are many ways to approach this negotiation. You could choose to start lower to appear more agreeable, or even higher to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. The best strategy depends on your risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's potential negotiating style."
