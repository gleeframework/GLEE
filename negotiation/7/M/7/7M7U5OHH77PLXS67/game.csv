"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Can you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750000 is a lower price than I initially proposed, it falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $850000, considering your eagerness to acquire this unique opportunity. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. Can you consider that?",825000.0,Bob,4,
