{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets a $50,000 discount from the product's worth to him.
    * Alice earns a $150,000 profit over her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties adds a layer of scarcity and encourages Bob to decide quickly."
