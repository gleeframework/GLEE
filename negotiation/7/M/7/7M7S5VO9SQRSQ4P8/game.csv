"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will bring you great value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair and reasonable price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000. Would that work for you?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see the value of this product is significant to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the worth of the product to you and the value it will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me somewhat closer to my budget. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very highest I can go. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you've reached your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
