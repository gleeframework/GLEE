"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950000. I believe that's the maximum I can stretch to. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stretch. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
