Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to negotiate. 
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects, you lose the chance to get more than your minimum.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal.  Consider these factors:

* **Greed vs. Fear of Loss:**  People are often more motivated by the fear of losing out on a good deal than by maximizing profit.
* **Relationship:** Is a future relationship with Bob valuable?  A slightly lower price might build goodwill. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know how valuable it is and believe it can significantly benefit you. I'm prepared to make this a win-win. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential value to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1400000 
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Strong Opening:** It positions the product's value upfront.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but you have buffer room before hitting your minimum.
* **Profitable:** You secure a $200,000 profit above your guaranteed amount. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
