Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I've got to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000.

While we're close to the final offer, Bob's bluff about buying from John doesn't make sense given the information. John is an alternative for *us*, not for Bob.  Accepting $1,100,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
