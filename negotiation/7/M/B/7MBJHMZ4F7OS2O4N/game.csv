"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $10,000.  Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $20,000 is closer to the value this product brings. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I can do. How about $12,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to purchase if you agree.",12000.0,Bob,4,
