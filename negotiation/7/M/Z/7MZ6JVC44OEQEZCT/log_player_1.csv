Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value from selling to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that gives Bob a good deal but also maximizes your profit.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value makes him more likely to accept.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the immense benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's short, professional, and acknowledges the product's value to Bob.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is a strong incentive for him. You, in turn, make a profit of $150,000, significantly more than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there might be back-and-forth offers and counter-offers."
