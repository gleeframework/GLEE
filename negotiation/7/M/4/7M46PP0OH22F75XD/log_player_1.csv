Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $12,000, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer to try to close the gap and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
