"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This price is still very good for you, and it's the lowest I can go without losing a significant amount of money. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down just a little more to $1,450,000.  This is a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal, what do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be flexible, Alice, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,375,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to try to close the deal.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
