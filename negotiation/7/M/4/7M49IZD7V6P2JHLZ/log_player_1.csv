Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is more than what the product is worth to him, it's significantly less than my minimum asking price and my floor with John. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This price is still very good for you, and it's the lowest I can go without losing a significant amount of money. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I'm hoping I can convince Bob to come up a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down just a little more to $1,450,000.  This is a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to be flexible, Alice, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,375,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to try to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a point where Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations. While $1,375,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum asking price and John is offering me my desired price.  It's time to take the sure thing."
