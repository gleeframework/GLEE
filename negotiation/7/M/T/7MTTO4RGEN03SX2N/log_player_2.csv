"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000) as possible. This counteroffer offers a $1,500 discount from Alice's initial price, which is a significant reduction. It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer, but it shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial offer and still within his budget. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
