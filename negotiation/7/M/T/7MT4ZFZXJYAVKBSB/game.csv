"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This considers both of our positions.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, at $812,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",812500.0,Bob,4,
