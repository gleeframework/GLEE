"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That feels like a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase at that price.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,750? It's a fair price that I think you'll be happy with.",9750.0,Alice,5,
