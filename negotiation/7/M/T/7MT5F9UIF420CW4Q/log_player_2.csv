Bob should reject the offer. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue trying to get a lower price."

Bob should accept the offer.  He's already gotten the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $9,000.  Going to John would cost him $10,000, and it's unlikely he can negotiate a lower price with Alice at this point.  $9,750 is a good compromise and saves him $250 compared to John."
