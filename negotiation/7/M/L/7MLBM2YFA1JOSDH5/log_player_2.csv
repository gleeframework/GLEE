# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter.  How about we start at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more.  We're still within our budget, and there's no harm in trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway!  $135 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to get it for $130. Would you be willing to go that low? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to compromise and offer you $132.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $132.50, which is within my budget and a good deal. There are still rounds left, but I'm not sure if I can get a lower price. It's better to secure the product now and avoid risking the chance of Alice raising her price or me missing out."
