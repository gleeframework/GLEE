"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to demonstrate my seriousness about buying the product while still leaving room for negotiation. My offer is $1,000 below my maximum budget, giving Alice some wiggle room while still being a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $13,500? It's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000. I'm not willing to spend more than that, even for a ""compromise.""  It's worth seeing if I can get Alice to come down further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  This offer is still within my budget, and I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal at this price.  If she rejects, I'm prepared to buy from John at $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I can do $13,200, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,200 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  I'm getting closer, but I'm determined to get the best possible price. I'll make one last counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,200 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,800. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $12,800, which is still within my budget and represents a significant compromise from my initial counteroffer. This final offer shows my commitment to buying the product, but also sets a clear boundary. If Alice rejects this, I'll move on to John's offer to avoid exceeding my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're making a final offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's the lowest I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. While we've gotten closer, I'm not willing to exceed my budget.  John has offered a guaranteed price of $12,000, which fits my budget and avoids any further negotiation.  I'll buy the product from John to ensure I get the best price and avoid any further risk of going over budget."
