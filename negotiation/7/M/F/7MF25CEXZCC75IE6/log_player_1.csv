"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110, but that's the lowest I can go right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105. It's fair for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try one more counteroffer and then see if John is still available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm trying to do the same. I'm going to meet you halfway and offer the product for $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I really hope we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get it for $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now. Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from $105, and I've already made several concessions. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120. This ensures I meet my minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
