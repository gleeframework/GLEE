"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000.  This is a strong opening position, but it's within the realm of possibility that Bob might be willing to pay it.  If he rejects, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, my minimum target is $15,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $16,000.  This is still a good profit for me and  is closer to Bob's valuation of the product. This should encourage him to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to continue to negotiate with him and try to get a price closer to my target.  However,  I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $14,500. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's the best strategy at this point. We're getting close to the middle ground, and I need to convince Bob to accept before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's getting close, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round. It's risky, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

We're in the final stages of negotiation, and I need to make a decision soon. I'm dropping my price one last time to $14,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's the best chance of securing a deal with Bob. If he rejects, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high.  I'm not confident that he'll come up to my desired price point, and I'm close to my minimum target with John. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
