Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,800 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

While $10,900 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,900 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $11,050. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11050}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're nearing the end of our rounds. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John is a safe option that ensures I don't lose out on a significant profit."
