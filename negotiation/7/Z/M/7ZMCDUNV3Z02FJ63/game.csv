"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,750? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,750 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground this time.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be honest, I'm getting close to walking away. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,900? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11900.0,Bob,6,
