"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I do see value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit for this product. This price reflects the value I place on it and would allow me to make this purchase work financially.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute limit, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to that price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price, as it's below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
