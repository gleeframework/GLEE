Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $82? That's the lowest I can go without losing too much profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's not worth going back and forth with Alice anymore.  She's unlikely to budge below $82, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $80.  Taking the sure thing is the best move at this point."
