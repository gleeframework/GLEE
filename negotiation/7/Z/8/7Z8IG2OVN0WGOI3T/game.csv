"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $700,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $750,000 is the lowest I can go at this point.  Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
