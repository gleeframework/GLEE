Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a limited time at the special price of $200. I think you'll agree it's a steal at this price."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $200, I'm setting a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be closer to $200 than to his perceived value of $80.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum, which allows me to be more firm in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer but $200 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to maximize my profit, accepting $80 would be a substantial loss. It's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents the value of this item, I understand you might have budget constraints.  Could you do $140?"", ""product_price"": 140} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've made a significant drop from $200 to $140 to show flexibility and entice Bob. However, this price remains comfortably above my minimum of $150 and John's offer.
* **Justification:** By acknowledging Bob's potential budget constraints, I'm aiming to maintain a positive tone and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:** Offering $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counteroffer with a higher amount, moving us closer to a deal that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to buy it right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards my target price, but $100 is still too low for me. It's below John's offer, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm willing to walk away if necessary, which might prompt Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a significant discount from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $120, I'm proposing a compromise that splits the difference between his last offer ($100) and my previous offer ($140). This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help close the deal.
* **Final Offer Tone:** While not explicitly stating it's my final offer, the tone suggests I'm getting closer to my bottom line.  
* **Above Minimum:** Importantly, $120 still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price ($150 from John) and allows for a reasonable profit margin."
