"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents the value of this item, I understand you might have budget constraints.  Could you do $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to buy it right away.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a significant discount from my initial price.",120.0,Alice,5,
