"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap between our positions. I can go up to $750,000, but that's my limit.  It's a fair offer considering what I'm willing to pay for this product."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm open to finding a solution, but I have other interested buyers.  To be candid, if we can't agree on a price closer to $1,700,000, I might need to explore those other options. What would you say to a price of $1,600,000? That feels like a significant move on my part to demonstrate my commitment to making this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I'm disappointed we haven't been able to reach a more agreeable number.  To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer from another buyer for $1,500,000.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to be realistic. I'm willing to work with you one last time: if you can meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to accept the other offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she won't go below $1,400,000.  You've already hit your maximum budget of $800,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs, making it the most logical decision at this point."
