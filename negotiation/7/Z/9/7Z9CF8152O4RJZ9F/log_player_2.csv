Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a profit.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to split the difference with you. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $13,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at your target price from John."
