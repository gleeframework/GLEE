"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're thinking.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer on the price. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think it's a little high. Could you do $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to split the difference with you. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,7,
