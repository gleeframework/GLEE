"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher figure.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, reflecting the value this product brings.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
