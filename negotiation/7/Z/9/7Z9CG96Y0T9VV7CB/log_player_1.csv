Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, and it might be more than Bob is willing to pay. However, it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also establishes a high initial value for the product in Bob's mind. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to carefully analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it. My goal is to get as close to my minimum price of $800,000 as possible while still maximizing my profit. If negotiations stall or I sense Bob is not serious, I can always switch to John, who offers a guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I still value the product significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that we're nearing an agreement. Accepting his offer of $850,000 ensures a successful sale and a decent profit, which is better than risking further negotiation or settling for John's offer."
