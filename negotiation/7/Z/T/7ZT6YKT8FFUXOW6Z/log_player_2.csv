"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further before committing."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  There's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John for a guaranteed price that fits my budget. Further negotiation with Alice may not yield a better price, and I risk losing the product altogether."
