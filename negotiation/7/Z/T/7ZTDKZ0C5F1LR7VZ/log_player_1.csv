"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than the product's value to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to spark his interest.

**Strategy:**

This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and set a high starting point for negotiations. I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer, but I'm confident that I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds if necessary. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $900,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I'm still not willing to settle for $900,000. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially considering that I have multiple rounds left.  

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's true value.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm aiming to find a compromise by offering a price halfway between Bob's last offer ($900,000) and my previous offer ($1,200,000).
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, highlighting the product's value. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly implying that I'm willing to negotiate, but not for much longer.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility and my desire to reach a deal. This approach also keeps the negotiation moving forward while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for $950,000. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially considering I have 6 rounds left.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** I want to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Time is on my side:** With multiple rounds remaining, I'm in a better position to wait for a more favorable offer.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I don't want to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's true value.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price. I will continue to be flexible but firm in my negotiation strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000. This is a final offer from my side, considering the product's value and our time constraints. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:**  While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my previous offer.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that we have limited time for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Push for Minimum:**  I'm pushing for my minimum acceptable price, knowing that accepting John's offer is always an option if negotiations fail.
* **Balancing Act:**  I'm striking a balance between being firm and showing willingness to compromise to reach a deal.
* **Building Pressure:** By emphasizing the finality of the offer and time constraints, I'm aiming to create pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your final offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet your asking price. I would like to counter with a price of $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the constraints of our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and the remaining time is not worth the potential loss of $25,000. 

**Strategy:**

* **Guaranteed Income:**  It's crucial to prioritize securing a known and reliable income source. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** I'm choosing to minimize the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the potential gain of $25,000.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most rational decision at this point. It guarantees my minimum desired price and provides a reliable outcome, eliminating the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
