"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer!  While $175 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is still a bit higher than your target price. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $155. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
