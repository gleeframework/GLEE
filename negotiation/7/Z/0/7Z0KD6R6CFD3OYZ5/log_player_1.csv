Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, so I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, but still a decent amount above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and avoid going back and forth for too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to go that low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his unwillingness to meet me halfway makes it clear that a deal isn't likely.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
