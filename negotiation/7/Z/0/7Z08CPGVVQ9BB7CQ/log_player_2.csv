# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity for you to gain [briefly highlight a key benefit Bob would get from the product]. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. My offer price is $1400000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the offer. While $850000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $1100000.  This would still allow me to achieve my goals, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While $950000 is still below my target, I recognize the value this product brings to you and want to find a solution that works for both of us. To move forward, I'm offering a price of $1050000.  This represents a substantial compromise from my previous offer and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget of $800,000, even though it's a lower price than before.
