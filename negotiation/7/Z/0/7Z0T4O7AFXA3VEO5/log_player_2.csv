# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,500 is lower than her original offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  He can get the product from John for $8,000. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice or accept John's offer."
