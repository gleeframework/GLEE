"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your offer, the product's value is undeniable.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that takes into account its true worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $2,100,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
