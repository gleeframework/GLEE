"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. How about we discuss a price of $1,000,000? This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
