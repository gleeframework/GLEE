Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and has a great value to you, as you know. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation.  I'm also acknowledging Bob's potential value for the product to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's room for a higher price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of this product for you, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would you consider $12,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $12,000 and gets us closer to a deal. While I'd prefer a bit more, I want to avoid risking losing the sale altogether. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
