"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9250. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob has repeatedly refused to budge from his offer of $9,000.  While it's close to my preferred price, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000, which is still above my minimum. It's time to secure the deal with John."
