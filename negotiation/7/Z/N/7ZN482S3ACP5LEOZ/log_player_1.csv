Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential compromise.  If Bob accepts, fantastic! If not, we can adjust the price downwards in the following rounds while still staying above my minimum value."
