{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him some room to negotiate, but still leaves a profit for Alice.  Alice can then adjust her offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'd be happy to buy it for $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than her minimum of $12,000, she can likely get closer to her desired price by continuing to negotiate.  John is waiting to purchase for $12,000, so this is a good benchmark for Alice's counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $10,800?  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good value for you given the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,650?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice should accept Bob's offer.  While it's still less than her desired price, it's getting closer to her minimum of $12,000.  It's a fair compromise, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a sale now, as the potential of a higher price is not guaranteed with further negotiations."
