,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'd be happy to buy it for $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $10,800?  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good value for you given the product's potential.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,650?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",10650.0,Bob,4,
