"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  It's worth negotiating further to see if I can get closer to my target of saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you starting the conversation. While $600,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $550,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 550000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to move a bit, but $650,000 is still too high for my target.  I'm going to counteroffer again and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $600,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer of $600,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $620,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair price and I'm willing to move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $620,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get it for $600,000, Alice is showing she's firm on the price.  At $620,000, I'm still saving $180,000, which is a significant amount.  It's also worth considering that if I reject this offer, it's likely Alice will counter with something closer to $650,000.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the most financially prudent decision at this point."
