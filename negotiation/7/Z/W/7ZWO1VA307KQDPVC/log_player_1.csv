Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a significant discount for me but still above Bob's perceived value. This creates room for negotiation while ensuring a reasonable profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the potential upside.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate, but the price is still high enough to make a counteroffer attractive to me. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! We have a deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000, securing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:**  $850,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I believe there is room to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob acknowledged the product's value.
* **Minimizing risk:** While I could sell to John for $1,500,000,  I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, aiming for a compromise. If he rejects again, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a valuable product at a lower price than my initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price in the middle of my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($850,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable deal for me.
* **Emphasizing Value and Compromise:** My message re-emphasizes the product's value and highlights the significant compromise I'm making. This adds pressure for Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously.
* **Keeping Options Open:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, but I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to him. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  We have a deal, and I can secure a decent profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to re-evaluate my options.  I may make another counteroffer, or I might decide to sell to John, depending on the situation and the potential for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  I'm confident this price works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, indicating there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could sell to John, I prefer to explore if I can get closer to my desired price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $900,000, aiming to find a compromise. If he rejects again, I can re-evaluate the situation and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
