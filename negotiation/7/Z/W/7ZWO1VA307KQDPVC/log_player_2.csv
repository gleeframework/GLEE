"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still significantly above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have the opportunity to negotiate a better price or secure the product from John at a lower cost."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a valuable product at a lower price than my initial offer. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, I can still get the product from John for a lower amount.  I will counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900,000. To make this work for me, I need to be at $950,000.  This is a small increase, but it gets us closer to a deal.  Think of it as a final offer from my side. What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  Even though she claims it's a ""final offer,"" there's no guarantee that further negotiation will be successful.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I will buy it from John for $800,000."
