"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
