"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I see the value in the product,  $750,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could you consider $700,000? That would work much better for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
