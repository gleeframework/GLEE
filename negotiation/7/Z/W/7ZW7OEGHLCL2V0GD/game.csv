,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
