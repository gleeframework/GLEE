"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in this product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see that we're making progress. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $8,000 for the product if we can't come to an agreement. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but $10,500 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I've thought it over, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is my last offer, as I really need to consider the other buyer who is willing to pay $8,000. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider selling to them. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
