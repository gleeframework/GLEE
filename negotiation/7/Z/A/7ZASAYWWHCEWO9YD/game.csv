"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was hoping to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I appreciate your offer, it falls short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial asking price and offers you a substantial return on your investment. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
