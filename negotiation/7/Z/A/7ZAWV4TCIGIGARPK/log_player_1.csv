"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and your enthusiasm, but I am looking to keep my spending within $150. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. That's still a great price for this product and it leaves us both happy! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
 
I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to what I want. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and trying to find a middle ground."
