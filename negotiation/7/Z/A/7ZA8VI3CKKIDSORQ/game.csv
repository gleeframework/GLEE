"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, considering your budget and the value you see in the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1150000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1150000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1250000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1200000. If we can agree on this price, we can finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
