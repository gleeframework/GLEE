"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and market demand. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum but still below John's offer. This gives me room to negotiate and also shows Bob I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm mentioning the product's value and market demand to justify the price.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Although Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to explore a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a price that works for both of us. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000. This gives me flexibility in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, considering your budget and the value you see in the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns to show I'm listening and trying to be flexible. 
* **Appealing to common ground:** I'm emphasizing finding a ""middle ground"" to make it clear I'm open to further negotiation and a win-win solution. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1150000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, $1,150,000 is still below my desired price point and leaves very little room for profit. 
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, which gives me significant leverage. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can secure a higher price if I continue. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price. If that doesn't work, I'll move forward with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate the justification for the price.
* **Win-Win Approach:** I'm framing the offer as a ""win-win"" scenario, emphasizing mutual benefits from the deal.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's willingness to meet me halfway and potentially reach an agreement before I have to rely on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1250000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1200000. If we can agree on this price, we can finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk losing Bob as a buyer and being forced to sell to John for a lower profit.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decision. 

While I would prefer a higher price,  accepting this offer will secure a significant profit and avoid the risk of losing both Bob and potentially John as buyers."
