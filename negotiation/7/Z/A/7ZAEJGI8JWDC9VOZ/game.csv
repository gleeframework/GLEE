"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I appreciate your perspective on the value,  $12,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. Can you consider a counteroffer of $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's make it a clean $13,000.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",13000.0,Alice,5,
