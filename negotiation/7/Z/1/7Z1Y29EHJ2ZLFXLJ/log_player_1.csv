"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this one-of-a-kind product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you establish a strong anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and set a higher baseline for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer provides ample space for concessions throughout the 10 rounds, allowing you to gradually decrease the price while still aiming for a substantial profit.
* **Conveying Confidence:**  The confident tone reinforces the idea that the product is highly valuable and you believe in your pricing.

The goal is to gauge Bob's reaction and willingness to engage at this level, providing information for your subsequent moves."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is far beyond my budget.  To start, I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This represents my maximum value for this item.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his stated maximum value, it's too early to accept. You have eight rounds remaining, and there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more and are willing to engage in further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** By dropping $300,000, you show a willingness to negotiate but make it clear that you're seeking a substantial sum. This avoids appearing overly eager while still moving towards a potential agreement.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Re-emphasizing the product's worth reinforces your position that the price is justified and not arbitrary.
* **Maintaining a Strong Stance:** You're still aiming for a price well above your minimum, giving you room to make further concessions in later rounds if necessary.

The goal is to bring Bob back to the negotiating table while still pushing for a price that reflects your valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This represents a substantial compromise on my part and reflects the value I see in this unique item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now showing a willingness to move significantly from his initial offer. However, $1,200,000 is still a considerable distance from your target. You have time on your side and rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Test Bob's Resolve:** By declining, you gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be. It will reveal if he's genuinely interested in closing the deal or simply testing the waters. 
* **Maintain Negotiating Power:** Accepting at this point might signal that you're willing to settle for a lower price, weakening your position in subsequent rounds.

You'll proceed cautiously but optimistically in the next round, aiming for a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I acknowledge your latest offer shows you're serious.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm proposing $1,450,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging the progress we've made in this negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're lowering your price by $150,000, which is a substantial move but still keeps you well above Bob's current offer. This demonstrates flexibility while aiming for a favorable position.
* **Meeting Halfway:** By splitting the difference between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, you're signaling a desire to find a fair middle ground. 
* **Highlighting Progress:**  Reminding Bob of the negotiation's progress reinforces the idea that you're both working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to make a similar concession in the next round, moving the negotiation towards a potential close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,450,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  As a final offer, I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 nets you a $300,000 profit, which is a significant return.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob has framed this as his ""final offer,"" implying he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  After six rounds, both parties might be experiencing negotiation fatigue. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation stalling. 

While you could push for a higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's $1,000,000 offer outweighs the potential reward. It's a strategic decision to secure a favorable outcome now."
