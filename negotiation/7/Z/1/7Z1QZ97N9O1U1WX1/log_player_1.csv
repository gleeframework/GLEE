Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?  It's a fair compromise that I think we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100,  Bob has made it clear he won't go higher than $90.  At this point, it's better to accept his offer and get $90 than to risk losing him completely and having to sell to John for only $80."
