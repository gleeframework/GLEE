Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the high price by mentioning ""unique value"" and ""exclusive opportunity.""
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer, increasing the chances of reaching a deal above your minimum. 

**Important:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're still in a strong position with John as a backup buyer."
