Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $15,000, so anything less than that is a loss for me.
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000.  
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering Bob a price slightly lower than what I'd get from John. This gives Bob a potential benefit, and also gives me a chance to get a little closer to my desired price. 

**Outcome:**

* If Bob accepts, I make a profit of $4,000.
* If Bob rejects, I still sell to John for $15,000.

This strategy maximizes my chances of earning the most possible money while still acknowledging the possibility of Bob declining the offer."
