"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've had to invest in it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we try $825,000? It's a bit above your offer, but still a good compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Would you consider $800,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
