Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it allows me to earn a fair return. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Message:**  I've framed the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the value for Bob and the fairness of the price for me. 

**Strategy:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm aiming for a high initial offer to maximize my potential profit, but leaving space for negotiation.
* **Potential Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, I will consider his counteroffer and make a decision based on how much I want to close the deal versus waiting for John.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. If Bob refuses to meet my price, I can move on to John and ensure a profit of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product to me and a fair return for you. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While I'd prefer a higher price, $950,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might further lower his offer, and I might have to accept an even lower price or risk selling to John for $1,200,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further takes time and effort, and I can't guarantee a better outcome.

**Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It ensures a quick and profitable sale without jeopardizing my minimum return.**"
