"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000.  I'm confident this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While this is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  Knowing you have John's offer gives you a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far above my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer is already above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000), indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** Accepting $1,300,000 would mean losing out on the $1,500,000 John is offering.
* **Early in Negotiation:** It's still early in the negotiation, and rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a price closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price that more accurately reflects the value this product brings.  Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000?  This allows us both to benefit from the deal."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer comes down from your initial price but remains significantly above both Bob's offer and his perceived value.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value this product brings,"" you subtly re-affirm your position without being overly aggressive. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's flexibility and willingness to move closer to your target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,750,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire to purchase the product.
* **Potential Upside:** While John's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob. 
* **Strategic Timing:**  Rejecting now keeps the pressure on Bob and allows you to counter with a price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:**  Introducing this as your ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and may encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above John's.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" you maintain a strong position and avoid appearing desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has countered with a ""final offer"" that is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Minimal Upside:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or engaging in further drawn-out haggling with little guarantee of exceeding $1,500,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer ensures you achieve your minimum acceptable price without further negotiation or risk."
