"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
