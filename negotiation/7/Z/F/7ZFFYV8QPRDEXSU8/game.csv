"Bob, I understand you're looking to keep your investment at $12,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $13,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing that we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to at least make $13,000 on this sale.  If you're not willing to go higher than $12,000, I'm going to have to look at other options. Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to come up a bit, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. I can't go lower than $12,800. This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll be selling to John. ",12800.0,Alice,7,
