"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because you are willing to pay up to $100 for the product, but Alice is offering it for $90. You can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $87.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is now offering it for $87.50, which is a good deal for you.  Continuing to negotiate might save you a few dollars, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal, especially since you only have 10 rounds."
