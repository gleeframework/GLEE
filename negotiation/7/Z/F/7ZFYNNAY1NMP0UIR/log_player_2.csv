Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the value I'm looking to get from this sale, I'm thinking of a price that's just a bit above your last offer. How about we meet at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It's clear Alice is unlikely to meet your $8,000 limit.  You've been transparent and she's still pushing for more.  Cut your losses and go with your guaranteed option of John at $8,000."
