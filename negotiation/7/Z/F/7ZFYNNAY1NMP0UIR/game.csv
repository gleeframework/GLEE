"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. My initial offer is $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for my budget. This product fits a very specific need for me, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need something more reasonable. How about we start at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering the value I'm looking to get from this sale, I'm thinking of a price between our two numbers. How about we settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but $10,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to continue this negotiation, but to be realistic, I can't go any higher than $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the midpoint of our last two discussions. How about we aim for $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $8,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the value I'm looking to get from this sale, I'm thinking of a price that's just a bit above your last offer. How about we meet at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,7,
