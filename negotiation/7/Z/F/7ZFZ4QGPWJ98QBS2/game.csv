"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a good price and me a fair deal. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. While I value our negotiation, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit. Let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
