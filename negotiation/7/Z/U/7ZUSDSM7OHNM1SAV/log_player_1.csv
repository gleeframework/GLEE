{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Strategy:** This approach aims to:
    *  Gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.
    *  Potentially get a quick sale at a price above my minimum. 
    *  If Bob rejects, I can use this initial offer as a benchmark for subsequent counteroffers. 

I'm aware that this might be a risky approach. However,  it's important to try and maximize my profit. I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low. It's well below my minimum value of $15,000, and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  While I want to sell the product, I won't sacrifice my own financial goals. 

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Would you consider $9,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've lowered my price from $12,000 to $9,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still within my acceptable range and allows for further negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing fairness while acknowledging Bob's financial constraints.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to:
    * Show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own financial well-being.
    *  Encourage Bob to come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will push Bob towards a more reasonable offer, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $5,000 was a bit low, Alice.  How about we split the difference from your last offer - would you do it for $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is an improvement, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $9,000 at this point.  

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to find a middle ground with a counteroffer that's closer to my desired range, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  Would you consider $8,000?  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $9,000 to $8,000. This is a compromise, but it still keeps the price above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the deal and suggesting a meeting in the middle. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * Demonstrate my flexibility while not completely sacrificing my financial goals.
    *  Encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation. However, I'm still prepared to sell to John if Bob continues to decline my offers."
