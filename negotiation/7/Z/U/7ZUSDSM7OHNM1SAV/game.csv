"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Would you consider $9,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,000 was a bit low, Alice.  How about we split the difference from your last offer - would you do it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  Would you consider $8,000?  This would give us both a fair deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
