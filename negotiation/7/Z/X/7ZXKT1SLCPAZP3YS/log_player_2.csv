"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $120.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $150.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $30 compared to buying from John.  This is the best outcome for Bob, as he gets the product at a price lower than his perceived value."
