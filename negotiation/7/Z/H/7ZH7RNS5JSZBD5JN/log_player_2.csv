"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  This offer is good for the next 24 hours. If you're not interested, I will be selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Since you can buy the same product from John for $1,500,000, it's more beneficial to reject Alice's offer."
