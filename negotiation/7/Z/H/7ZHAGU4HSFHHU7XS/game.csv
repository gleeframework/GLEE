,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $115 is still a bit out of my range. How about $95?  I'm hoping we can find a compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to work with you. $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $105?  Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $98?  That's a good compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal if it works for you.",98.0,Bob,6,
