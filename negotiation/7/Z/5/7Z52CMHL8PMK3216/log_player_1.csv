Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also establishes a strong initial position.
* **Potential Loss Aversion:** Bob might be more motivated to buy now rather than risk losing the opportunity to purchase something he values at $10,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll still get my minimum price from John, but I might miss out on a higher profit."
