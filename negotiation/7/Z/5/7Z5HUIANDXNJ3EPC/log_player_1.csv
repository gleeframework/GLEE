Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's a good chunk above my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for a counter:**  I'm not offering the full $150 value because I want to see if Bob will negotiate. This gives me a chance to get a better price.
* **Positive and friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation.  This helps build rapport with Bob and increases the chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $100. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is too low:** While $100 is better than $80 (John's offer), it's still significantly less than my ideal price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob. He's already shown interest, and I can counter-offer to try and reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested! $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That still gives me a bit of room, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  I'm lowering my price but not by a huge amount. This shows I'm willing to be flexible but also that I value the product.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm still being friendly and positive, emphasizing that I want to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Specific reason for the price:**  I give a brief reason for my counter-offer ($110 gives me ""a bit of room""), which makes it seem more logical and less arbitrary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate it. I'll counter with $105. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $105 isn't ideal, it's only $5 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and try to counter-offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only John's $80 offer.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer, and I might not get a significantly better price. It's better to secure the sale now and move on."
