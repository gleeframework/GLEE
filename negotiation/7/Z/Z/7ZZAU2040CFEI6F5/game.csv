"Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product! While I agree it's a great fit, the price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you do $11,000?  That's a significant discount from my original offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a little steep for me though. How about $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $7,000 is closer, I can't let it go for less than $9,500. This product would really benefit you, and I'm confident it's a fair offer at this price.",9500.0,Alice,5,
