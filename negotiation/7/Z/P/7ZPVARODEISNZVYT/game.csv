"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $8,200 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to still get a good value for my product.  Let me know what you think.",8800.0,Alice,3,
