"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I understand the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, but it's significantly more valuable to me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $1,150,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a little low for me.  Given the value this product holds for both of us, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll accept $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that respects our respective needs. I'm confident you'll find this to be a good investment. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.
