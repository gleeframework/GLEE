"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. While $1,050,000 is closer, I need to be firm on the value this product offers.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,112,500? This is my final offer.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. My absolute maximum is $1,080,000.  If you're unable to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
