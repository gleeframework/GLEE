Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still far above John's offer, so we have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get Bob closer to our desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below our desired outcome. We can afford to negotiate a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. While $1,050,000 is closer, I need to be firm on the value this product offers.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,112,500? This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. My absolute maximum is $1,080,000.  If you're unable to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob's latest offer is getting very close to our minimum acceptable price. Continuing to push for a higher price might lead to him walking away. Accepting his offer ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale."
