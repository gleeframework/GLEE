"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm using positive language to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for potential counteroffers and negotiation, while still giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  
* **More negotiation needed:** I still have plenty of rounds left. I'm hoping to get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  Selling to John at this point would be giving up potentially more profit, especially since I have multiple rounds to improve the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $120 for the product. I'm confident it will be worth it to you in the long run. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer higher than Bob's:** I'm countering at $120, which is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Show flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob about the potential value of the product to justify my price.
* **Room for compromise:** I'm using the phrase ""meet me halfway"" to imply that I'm willing to compromise further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $110. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $110 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit below what I'd like to get.
* **Room for improvement:** We're still in the early rounds, and I believe I can potentially get a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Avoiding John:**  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I have a good chance of getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $110 is a fair offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $115.  How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small counter-offer:**  I'm increasing my offer by a small amount ($2.50) to show I'm willing to compromise but also maintain some leverage.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm reaffirming that Bob is getting a good deal and highlighting the value of the product.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering to split the difference is a common negotiation tactic that can make the offer seem fair to both parties. 
* **Confidence in the product:**  I'm reiterating my confidence in the product to reinforce its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $105. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150), it's still below what I'd like to get. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  We still have several rounds left. I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Avoid selling to John:** Selling to John would lock in a lower profit than I might be able to get from Bob, given the remaining rounds and the potential for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $105 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $110?  That way, we both get a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer in the middle:** I'm offering $110, which is the middle ground between Bob's latest offer of $105 and my previous offer of $112.50. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a reasonable price.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $110 is a ""fair price"" for both of us. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to accept my offer.
* **Keeping options open:** I'm still leaving room for more negotiation if needed, as we have several rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay more than $100. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too many rounds wasted:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob is sticking to his low offer. It seems unlikely that he'll increase his offer significantly in the remaining two rounds.
* **Time is running out:**  I only have two rounds left before I have to sell to John.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John will guarantee me my minimum acceptable price ($150) and eliminate the risk of Bob not accepting my final offer. 

While I'm not happy about selling at a lower price than I hoped for, it's the most sensible option at this point to ensure I don't lose out on any profit."
