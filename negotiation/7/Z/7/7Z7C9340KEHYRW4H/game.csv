"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, but $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $11000? It's a great compromise, if you ask me!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's split the difference and go with $9500.  It's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $10500? It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can make a deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,
