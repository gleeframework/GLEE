Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested buyers. Given its value and the demand, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation is Irrelevant:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000.  Therefore, any offer to Bob should be above that price.
* **Aim High, Room to Negotiate:** Starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Scarcity Tactic:** Mentioning other buyers and a ""limited-time offer"" could encourage Bob to act quickly, even if the product is only worth $8,000 to him. 

**Important:**  While we know Bob's valuation, in a real negotiation you wouldn't. This offer aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
