``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Openness:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate by mentioning I'm ""open to hearing your thoughts.""
* **Positive Tone:** Keeping the message positive can encourage Bob to engage and hopefully lead to a deal."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting allows me to keep the negotiation going and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value this product highly, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That seems like a fair price considering the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired price but still a compromise.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer (""value of the product""). This makes me seem more reasonable.
* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a middle ground (""meet in the middle""), I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer is closer to my desired price range than my minimum.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject, I risk Bob walking away, and I'm only $500 away from my minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With limited rounds left, it's better to accept and secure a decent deal."
