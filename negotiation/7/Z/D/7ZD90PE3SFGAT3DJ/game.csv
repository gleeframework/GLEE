"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $140? That's a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth every penny.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $140 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $137.50 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that?",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $137.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $138.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",138.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $138.50. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",135.0,Bob,6,
