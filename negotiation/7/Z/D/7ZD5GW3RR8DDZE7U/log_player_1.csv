Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I was hoping to find it within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to try and get a bit more than Bob's initial offer.  I'll see if I can meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for something a bit closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $125? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been firm on his offer of $120, and I've already rejected his offer once.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for the same price."
