Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation, but it's also below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and direct, outlining the offer and expressing confidence in its attractiveness. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counter-offer. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Risk of Losing Bob:** Offering too high a price upfront could scare him off.
* **John's Offer:** Keeping John's offer in mind will help me make smart decisions during negotiations. 
* **Understanding Bob's Willingness to Pay:** It's crucial to gauge how high Bob is willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential to Improve the Price:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that might bring us closer to a mutually acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is higher than his offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate, while also protecting my own interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering $850,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired range.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and reiterates that I'm willing to negotiate while also emphasizing that his offer is too low. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so I'm not taking a significant loss even if Bob accepts. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will need to assess his counter-offer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counter-offer, or sell to John.  The goal is to find a balance between maximizing my profit and maintaining a good relationship with Bob, as he might be a future customer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Potential for Future Business:** Accepting Bob's offer, even at a slight loss, might lead to future business opportunities. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but it could also risk losing Bob altogether or extending the process.

**Decision:**

Given the proximity to my minimum acceptable price and the potential for future business, I am choosing to accept Bob's offer."
