Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the potential value Bob will gain by accepting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm setting a starting point that is less than my minimum value, allowing for the possibility of a counteroffer and negotiation. 
* **Prepared for a Counteroffer:** I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer. If he does, I can adjust my offer based on his willingness to pay. 

I'm also keeping in mind my backup option with John, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm trying to be a smart buyer here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is interested in the product and has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can still get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **John is a safety net:**  While I'm optimistic about the negotiation, having John as a backup option provides a secure fall-back if things don't work out with Bob. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $750,000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but staying above Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product and suggesting that $850,000 is a fair price for both parties.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer keeps me closer to my desired price range, while also leaving space for further negotiation if needed. 

My goal is to find a middle ground and hopefully reach a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting his offer might lead to a stalemate or a further drop in price. There's a risk that he might walk away, and I might not get a better offer.
* **John's offer is still secure:**  While $825,000 is less than what John is offering, it's a decent deal, especially if there's a chance of negotiating further in the future.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal given the current circumstances."
