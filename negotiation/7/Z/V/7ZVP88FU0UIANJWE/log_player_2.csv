Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I think the product's value is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $850,000, which is still above your original offer of $600,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
