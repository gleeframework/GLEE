{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $80 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. It gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing the limit at $95. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up to $95, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to risk going any lower and potentially getting stuck with a sale that doesn't meet my financial goals. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, and it's a better decision in this situation."
