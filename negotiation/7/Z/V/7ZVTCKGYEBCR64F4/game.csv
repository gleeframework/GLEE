"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90 right now. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing the limit at $95. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal. ",95.0,Bob,4,
