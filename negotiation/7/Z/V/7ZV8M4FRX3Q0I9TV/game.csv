"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $12500? I think that's a fair price for the value this product offers.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $11750, but that's my absolute final offer.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",11750.0,Bob,8,
