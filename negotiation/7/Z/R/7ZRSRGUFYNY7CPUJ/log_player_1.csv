Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, leveraging the information about Bob's potential valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it would be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible while ensuring you're above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high (but below Bob's perceived value) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Create a Sense of Value:**  The language ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""wise investment"" subtly reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might:

* **Counter-offer:**  Be prepared to negotiate, but remember your bottom line is $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Reject outright:** If this happens, you have the safety net of selling to John."
