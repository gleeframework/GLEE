"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant amount above my minimum.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I need to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This will hopefully show Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a good price."

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum, and I don't want to risk going lower. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
