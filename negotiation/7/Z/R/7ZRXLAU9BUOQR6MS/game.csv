"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be interested in buying the product for $1,050,000. This price would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
