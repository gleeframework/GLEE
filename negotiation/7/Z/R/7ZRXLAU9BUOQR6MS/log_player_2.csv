"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price, but it's still significantly lower than John's price. This suggests there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be interested in buying the product for $1,050,000. This price would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's still lower than John's price and closer to your ideal price. While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise and you might end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
