"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest! While $85 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $87. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go right now.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $87 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to what we want. Let me know what you think!",88.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise.  While $88.50 is tempting, I'm still very close to my limit.  I'd be willing to go to $87.50 - that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",87.5,Bob,6,
