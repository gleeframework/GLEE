"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. You have the opportunity to negotiate a better price, and you're not locked into buying from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $85 is a good starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still respects the value of the product.
* **Be polite and express interest:** Maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Justify your offer:** Explain your rationale for the counteroffer to show you're not just making a random number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest! While $85 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further. You have multiple rounds left, and there's no guarantee that John's offer will be available in the future."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $87. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go right now.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your offer slightly:** You're moving closer to Alice's price, but not by too much. 
* **Reiterate your budget constraints:**  It's important to remind Alice of your limitations to make it clear that you won't go higher.
* **Express confidence:**  ""Let's see if we can make this happen"" implies you're still optimistic about a deal, but not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $87 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to what we want. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still a bit higher than your maximum. You have a few more rounds left, and John's offer is still available. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further to see if you can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise.  While $88.50 is tempting, I'm still very close to my limit.  I'd be willing to go to $87.50 - that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly higher offer:** You're showing flexibility and willingness to meet halfway, but still pushing for a better price.
* **Reiterate your budget constraints:**  You're subtly reminding Alice that you're not willing to go much higher.
* **Focus on fairness:** Emphasize that your offer is fair to both parties."
