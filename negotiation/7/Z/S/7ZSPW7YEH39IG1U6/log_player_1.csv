Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $85 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $100. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest! While $85 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $87. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go right now.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $87 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping to squeeze out a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $87 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to what we want. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise.  While $88.50 is tempting, I'm still very close to my limit.  I'd be willing to go to $87.50 - that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  We've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while we've gotten closer to a deal, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  John is offering my minimum price, so it's a better choice for me at this point."
