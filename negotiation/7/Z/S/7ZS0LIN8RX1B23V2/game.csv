"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $7,500.  Let me know what you think!",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a little hesitant at $8,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I'm confident we can make this work for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
