"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and would be a great addition to your collection. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $7,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a little hesitant at $8,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I'm confident we can make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $8,250 is not my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than what John is offering.  It's important to reach a deal and avoid risking losing the sale altogether."
