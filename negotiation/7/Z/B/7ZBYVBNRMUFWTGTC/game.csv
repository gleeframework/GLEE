"Alice,  $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal!",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $890,000.  This is a very reasonable compromise, and it ensures we both walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",890000.0,Alice,5,
