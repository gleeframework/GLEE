This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone by emphasizing fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired profit by continuing negotiations. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is a decent price, I'm still within my desired profit margin and believe we can reach an agreement closer to $900,000. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $890,000.  This is a very reasonable compromise, and it ensures we both walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 890000}
