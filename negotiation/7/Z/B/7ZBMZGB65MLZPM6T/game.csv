"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you.",925000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's true value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $775,000? I'm eager to make a deal, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this.  My final offer is $810,000.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price and reflects my willingness to negotiate. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",810000.0,Alice,5,
