Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:** $12,000 is a decent compromise between my minimum of $15,000 and Bob's valuation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, signaling I'm willing to negotiate further.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'm prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's response and keep the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle on $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum of $15,000 and even below Bob's own valuation of $8,000. Accepting this would be a huge loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Although Bob rejected my initial offer, he is still interested, indicating potential for further negotiation.
* **John's offer is the backup:** I can always sell to John for $15,000, which is a much better option than selling to Bob for $6,000.

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point, leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer and proposing a counter-offer. 
* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm still emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob and highlighting the ""fair profit"" for myself.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question, leaving the door open for further discussion. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is more appealing to both of us. I am still wary of accepting a price that is significantly below my desired minimum, but I am willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000, even though it's closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a strong alternative:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit that exceeds Bob's offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While $7,500 is closer, there's still room for negotiation to push the price higher.

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a slightly higher price, aiming to get closer to my desired minimum while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $7,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off.  How about we settle on $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly higher counter:**  I'm offering $8,500, which is a bit higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm highlighting that $8,500 is a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of a balanced deal.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially reach an agreement.

**This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desire to maximize my profit and Bob's financial limitations. I'm aiming to close the gap and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  However, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary.**"
