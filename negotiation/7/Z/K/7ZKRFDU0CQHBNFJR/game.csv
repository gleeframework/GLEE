"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle from my initial offer, rather than from the lower end of the spectrum. I'm willing to compromise at $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I still think $1400000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1600000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $1700000. Let's try $1650000. This is a fair price that should be more in line with what I'm looking for. What are your thoughts?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can we try $1550000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's the best I can do.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
