"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, it's significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. You can do better by rejecting and moving to John's offer."
