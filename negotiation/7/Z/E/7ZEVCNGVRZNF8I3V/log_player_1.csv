"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm ready to move forward with this purchase if we can agree on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is very close to his highest price and it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting the $10,500 offer secures a good profit above the alternative sale price.
