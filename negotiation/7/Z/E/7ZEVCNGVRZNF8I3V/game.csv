"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm ready to move forward with this purchase if we can agree on that price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
