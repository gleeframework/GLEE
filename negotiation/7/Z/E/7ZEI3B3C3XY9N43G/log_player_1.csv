{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find it reasonable and we can strike a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $85. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $90?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a better price for me. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

Bob seems adamant on his price. While I'm not getting the full value, I don't want to risk losing him completely and end up with nothing. Selling to John for $80 is the best option right now, as it guarantees I won't lose any money and will still make a profit."
