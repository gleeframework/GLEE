"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both of us.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, showing I'm willing to discuss the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the price, but I would like to counter with an offer of $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Bob's offer:** While $950,000 is a good price, it's still too low. There's room to negotiate further. 
* **Potential:** I believe I can get a higher offer from Bob. 
* **John's offer:**  While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to John yet. I want to explore Bob's willingness to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm happy to continue talking, but I'm going to need to see a price closer to $980,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I've moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, showing I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Clear expectations:** I've stated my desired price point directly, leaving no room for ambiguity.
* **Maintaining negotiation:** I've phrased the message in a way that keeps the dialogue open and encourages further discussion.
* **Avoiding John:**  I'm still aiming for a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position. I am willing to increase my offer to $965000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  Bob's offer of $965,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit lower than my target.
* **Opportunity to push for more:** I believe I can get a higher price if I continue negotiating.
* **John's offer:**  I'm still not desperate to sell to John, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $965,000 still falls short of my expectations. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $972,500? "", ""product_price"": 972500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a midpoint between my last offer ($980,000) and Bob's current offer ($965,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Confidence in the deal:** I'm expressing confidence that we can find a price that benefits both of us. This subtly reinforces my position.
* **Avoiding John:**  I'm still aiming for a better deal than John's offer, and I believe this counteroffer will sway Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground, Alice. I am willing to consider $970000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  Bob's offer of $970,000 is very close to my desired price point of $972,500. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I may end up with John's lower offer.
* **Time is ticking:** We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation rounds.
* **Taking the win:**  While I'd love to get that extra $2,500, securing $970,000 is a solid outcome and a significant profit."
