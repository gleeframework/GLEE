# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Alice's offer is higher than that, so it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you can get from John. You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,062,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,068,750? This feels like a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you can get from John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better deal, and it's likely that the price will continue to fluctuate. It's more beneficial to secure the product from John at a guaranteed $1,000,000."
