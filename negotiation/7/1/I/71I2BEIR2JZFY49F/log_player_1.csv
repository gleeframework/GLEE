Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than $80, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum value:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you don't lose money.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, but still aim to earn more than $120. If the negotiation drags on, you can always fall back on selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $90?  I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell for more, $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and close to my desired price.  Accepting Bob's offer will allow me to complete the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
