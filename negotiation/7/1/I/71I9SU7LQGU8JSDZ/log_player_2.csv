"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $10,000 and both Alice and John are offering the product at that price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
