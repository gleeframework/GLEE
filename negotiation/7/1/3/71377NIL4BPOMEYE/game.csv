"Hi Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still leaves room for you to get a great deal and is closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to offer $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
