Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to offer $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer of $9,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
