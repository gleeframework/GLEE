Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $145. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob only values the product at $120, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Appearing flexible:**  Mentioning you're offering it to him first and are willing to ""let it go"" for a lower price might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price of $145 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing a price higher than John's offer."
