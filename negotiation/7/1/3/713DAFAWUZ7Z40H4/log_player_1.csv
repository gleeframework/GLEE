Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Optimistic but Reasonable:** $110 is still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, especially if he values the product highly. 
* **Setting the Stage:** I'm being friendly and mentioning Bob's potential interest to make the negotiation feel less adversarial.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.  I'll always keep in mind that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident I can do better. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll also be mindful of the fact that I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a compromise price of $95. This is a middle ground between my original offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my rationale for the counteroffer by emphasizing fairness and finding a price that benefits both of us. 
* **Maintaining Control:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm showing him that I'm in control of the negotiation and I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Keep John in mind:** I'm still aware of John's offer of $100. If Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer, I'll likely make one more offer before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I've already made a counteroffer and he's rejected it.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm better off selling the product to John for $100, which is a guaranteed profit and a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer.  

**Key Considerations:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** I'm sticking to my principle of not selling below $100.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a reliable and higher-value option.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might waste time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome."
