{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation to see if I can secure a good deal. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for below my minimum valuation of $80.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $75?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $65. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $65 is below my minimum valuation of $80.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge any further, and it's likely to be a time-consuming process.  Selling to John for $80 is a sure thing, and it's the best way to maximize my profit."
