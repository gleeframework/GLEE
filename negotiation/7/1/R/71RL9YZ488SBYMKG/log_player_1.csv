Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'd love to offer you. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting at $150, I'm leaving room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Enthusiastic tone:**  A positive tone helps create a good rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how much I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $110?  I'm really interested in the product, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not quite there:**  While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob clearly wants the product, and he's willing to negotiate.  This suggests I can push for a higher price. 
* **Counteroffering:**  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target.  This will let Bob know I'm not willing to settle for his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest in the product! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is just a little too low for me.  How about $125?  Let's split the difference and make this work."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing $125, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining enthusiasm:** I'm keeping the tone positive and reaffirming my interest in selling the product to Bob. This can help maintain a good rapport during negotiations.
* **Emphasizing the compromise:** I'm highlighting the fact that I'm willing to come down from my initial price to reach a compromise. This helps make my counteroffer more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $120. This is my final offer, as I can get the product from John for that price.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Close to desired price:** $120 is only slightly below my desired range, and significantly better than selling to John.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob going to John and losing the sale altogether. 

It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a price that's still profitable for me."
