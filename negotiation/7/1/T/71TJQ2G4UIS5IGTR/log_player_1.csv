Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit, but leave room for negotiation:** Offering the product close to your minimum price ($1,500,000) ensures you maximize potential profit. However, starting slightly lower at $1,450,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Create a sense of exclusivity:**  By emphasizing Bob has the ""exclusive opportunity,"" it subtly implies scarcity and value, potentially making him more inclined to accept. 
* **Highlight the product's value:** While we don't know the specifics of the product, mentioning its ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" reinforces its worth to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're guaranteed to sell the product to John for your minimum desired price. This puts you in a strong negotiating position."
