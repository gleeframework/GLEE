Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $119."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over. Offering the product at $119 leaves Bob with a small gain ($1) while netting you the highest possible profit.

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach uses a negotiation tactic called ""anchoring."" By starting with a price close to Bob's maximum valuation, you set a high anchor. While he might try to negotiate down, the initial offer makes it more likely he'll settle for a price that's still highly profitable for you."
