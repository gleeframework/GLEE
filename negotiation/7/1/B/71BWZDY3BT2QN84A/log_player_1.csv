"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) as a negotiation tactic. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still achieving a profitable sale.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob.  This can encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Direct and Concise:** I'm keeping my message clear and concise, focusing on the offer itself. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round, and I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to make a counter-offer, walk away and sell to John, or use other negotiation tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is better than my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to achieve. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will proceed to make a counter-offer in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's offer and consider factors like his potential valuation, the remaining rounds, and my own risk tolerance.  I'll craft a counter-offer that aims to secure a price closer to my desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,200,000 to reflect its unique value.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but acknowledging its value while emphasizing the product's unique worth.
* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  I'm suggesting a price ($1,100,000) that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, with a clear reason for the price.
* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by suggesting a middle ground and seeking a compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his counter-offer or acceptance.  If he rejects my offer, I'll need to carefully consider whether to continue negotiating or to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that number? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations or potentially losing out to John.

**Important Note:** The decision to accept Bob's offer is based on the fact that we're at the 4th round and I'm close to my minimum acceptable price.  If I were in the early rounds, I might have been more inclined to reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
