"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $120, and it's a fantastic opportunity to get a deal on something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message expresses continued interest in the product while clearly stating the price is an issue. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet in the middle and offer the product for $110. This is still above its worth to you, but it's a fair compromise given our previous discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice meeting in the middle at $110 is a good deal. It's below your maximum budget and a decent saving compared to John's offer or Alice's initial price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are small and there's a risk Alice could walk away. It's better to secure a good deal now."
