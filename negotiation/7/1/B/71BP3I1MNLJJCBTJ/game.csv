"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $9000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $9500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go any lower than $9400.  It's a great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it at that price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9400.0,Alice,5,
