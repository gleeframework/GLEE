"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer $825,000.
