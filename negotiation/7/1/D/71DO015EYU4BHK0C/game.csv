"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product at $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,000? That's a reasonable price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're okay with it.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
