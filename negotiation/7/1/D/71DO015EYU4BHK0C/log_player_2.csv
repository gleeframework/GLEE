Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium.

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $13,000 and I can get it for $12,000 from John. There's no point in further negotiation."
