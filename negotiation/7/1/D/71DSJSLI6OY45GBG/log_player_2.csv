Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $110, but I'm still open to negotiating. How about we meet at $125? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125. Since you can get the product for $120 from John, it makes more sense to buy it from him and save the extra $5."
