Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really hoping to get this product for under $14,000, though.  How about $13,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $14,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a bit more, but $14,000 is still a little higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,750.  This is a good compromise and will allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to $14,000, Bob's offer of $13,750 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum of $12,000, and it's a good compromise."
