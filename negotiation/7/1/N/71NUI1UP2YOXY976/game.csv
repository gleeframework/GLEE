"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really hoping to get this product for under $14,000, though.  How about $13,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $14,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's find a middle ground!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a bit more, but $14,000 is still a little higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,750.  This is a good compromise and will allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's meet in the middle!",13750.0,Bob,4,
