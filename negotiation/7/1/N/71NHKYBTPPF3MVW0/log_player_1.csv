Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my target of $1,450,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
