"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1300000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1375000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $1325000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 isn't quite working for me.  How about we compromise at $1287500?  It's a fair price that's closer to both of our expectations.  Let's seal this deal.",1287500.0,Alice,7,
