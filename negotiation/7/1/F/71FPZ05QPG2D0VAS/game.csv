"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  This item would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $10,000? That feels like a fair offer considering the value it provides.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway.  However, $14,000 is still a bit above what I can justify right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise that considers the value to both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
