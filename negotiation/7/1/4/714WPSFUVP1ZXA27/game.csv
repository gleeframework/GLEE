"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
