Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and your own asking price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
