"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering. 
* There's a good chance Alice will negotiate further, especially since she values the product at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and your own asking price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000.
* This price is a significant saving compared to buying from John for $12,000.
* While there's always a chance Bob could negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower, considering her own value of $8,000. 
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with and avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart or Alice getting a better offer from someone else."
