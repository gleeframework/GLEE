"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $18000. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is $8000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $16000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is $8000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but $15500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is $8000. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $13000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $14500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
