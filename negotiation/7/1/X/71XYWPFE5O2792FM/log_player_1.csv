Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $12,000 is simply not acceptable. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,500. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $14,000 is still too low. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before I go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 15500}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm coming down to $15,500, which is just a bit above my absolute minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'm going to go with John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is still too low. I've already made multiple concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm going to take John's offer of $15,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than settling for a price I'm not comfortable with."
