"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  I'm asking $950,000 for it, which reflects its unique capabilities and potential for growth.  I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussing a reasonable counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I believe it's worth exploring further. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, potentially closing the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John right now would secure a guaranteed profit, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to accept $875,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  However, given that John is also willing to pay this price, I'm choosing to sell to John. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures I get my minimum desired value for the product."
