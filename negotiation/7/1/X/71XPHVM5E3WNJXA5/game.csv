"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $1,200,000. This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about we settle for $1,750,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which represents a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal work.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
