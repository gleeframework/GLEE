"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is good, but not *that* good.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference between our previous offers and land at $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll counteroffer at $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to budge a little more, but $13,500 is still pushing it. Would you consider $12,750?  That's a fair compromise in my book.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go much lower than $13,500, but I'll meet you in the middle at $13,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",13250.0,Alice,7,
