"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high with $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and ensures I'm not underselling myself right away. I'm also aware of the time limit and the backup offer from John, so I'll need to be firm but flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, and I have enough rounds left to try.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to close the deal before he changes his mind or I run out of time.  While I'd prefer more, it's a solid deal and I can still make a good profit."
