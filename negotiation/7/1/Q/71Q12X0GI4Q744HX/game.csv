"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1750000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1550000? This would still give you a good deal and is closer to the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
