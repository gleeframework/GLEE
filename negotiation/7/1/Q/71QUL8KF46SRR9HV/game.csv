"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $7,000 is quite a bit lower than your asking price. How about $7,750? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $8,250. It's a compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
