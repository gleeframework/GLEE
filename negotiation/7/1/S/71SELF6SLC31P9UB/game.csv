"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $16000?  This way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $14000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
