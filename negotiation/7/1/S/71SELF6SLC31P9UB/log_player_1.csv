Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than the $15,000 floor I've set for myself.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe there's room for a more favorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $16,000?  This way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $14000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is the best offer so far and very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a good deal for me considering he is still willing to pay a premium, and  it's worth taking the offer now to avoid further negotiation rounds."
