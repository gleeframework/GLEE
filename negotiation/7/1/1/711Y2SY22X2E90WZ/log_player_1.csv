Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get $800,000 from John, so this is my floor.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price significantly higher than my minimum, but still within a range that's likely attractive to Bob. This gives me a good chance of securing a higher price while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he got a good deal."
