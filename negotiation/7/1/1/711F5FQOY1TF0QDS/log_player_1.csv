Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  While you value the product at $150 and Bob values it at $120, there's a potential agreement zone in between.  Offering it at $135 gives Bob a chance to feel like they're getting a slight discount, while still earning you a profit significantly above Bob's valuation. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives you leverage. You don't need to go below your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Bob might negotiate, and you can then decide whether to adjust your price slightly or stick to your minimum of $150."
