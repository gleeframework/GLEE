{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate while still being within a range that is profitable for you.
* **The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.** It also highlights the shared value of the product to build trust.

**Strategy:**

By starting at $1,100,000, I'm trying to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter his offer, but I'll be mindful of John's offer of $1,200,000 as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000, it's still below my target. I believe there's room for negotiation and that I can secure a higher price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering a price of $1,075,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's a slight reduction from my first offer but still higher than Bob's current proposal.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express my willingness to negotiate. I use positive language to maintain a collaborative tone, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing negotiation:** I'm aiming for a balance between maximizing my profits and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By offering a counteroffer slightly lower than my initial price, I'm signaling that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but not willing to settle for too low of a price.
* **Positive framing:** The message is designed to maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere, which can help keep the negotiations moving in the right direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your latest offer carefully. I am willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I believe there's still room to negotiate and secure a better deal.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to $1,100,000, but will be mindful of the need to reach an agreement before I risk losing Bob altogether.
*  I'm confident that I can secure a better price than $1,062,500, given the value of the product and my potential to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1,062,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'll offer $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,087,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,075,000 and Bob's latest offer of $1,062,500. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a price that is closer to my desired outcome.
* **Message:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I emphasize the need for a final decision, hoping to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  By offering a compromise, I'm aiming to find a price that both Bob and I can agree on. This approach should make the negotiation more likely to succeed.
* **Urgency:** I've added a sense of urgency to the message, hoping to push Bob towards acceptance. This might encourage him to make a final decision rather than continuing to negotiate.
* **Flexibility:** I'm still willing to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm confident that $1,087,500 is a reasonable price that will allow me to make a significant profit while still satisfying Bob's needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1,080,000 for your product. This is a fair price that respects its value while allowing us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is only $2,500 lower than my previous counteroffer and is getting very close to my target price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,100,000,  I'm confident that this is a good deal, and there's a risk of losing Bob entirely if I continue to reject his offers.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale at a price that's still very profitable for me. I'm also minimizing the risk of Bob walking away and me having to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Reaching Agreement:**  It's important to consider the value of reaching an agreement, even if it's not the absolute best-case scenario.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better price, but also increases the risk of losing the deal entirely."
