,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget limitations but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $19,000. This is a fair offer reflecting the product's worth.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $19,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. Would you consider $14,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
