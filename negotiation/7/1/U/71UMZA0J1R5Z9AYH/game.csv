"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with.  $950,000 is a bit too low for me, however, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and still allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
