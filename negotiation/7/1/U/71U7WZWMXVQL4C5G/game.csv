"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $750,000? I'm excited about the product and would like to make a fair deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
