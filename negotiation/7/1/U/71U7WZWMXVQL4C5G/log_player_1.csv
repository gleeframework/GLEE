Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $750,000? I'm excited about the product and would like to make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a better price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, how about we aim for $850,000? I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is close enough to my desired price point that I'm willing to accept. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
