Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $180. This is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm willing to come down to $165. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to make a sale to Bob, his stubbornness is causing the negotiation to drag on.  Selling to John guarantees me a fair price, and I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower amount."
