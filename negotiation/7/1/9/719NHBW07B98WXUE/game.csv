"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the product's value. While I respect your budget constraints, I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. I am unable to accept $70 for the product. However, I would like to propose a compromise at $85, which still allows us to cover costs and maintain profitability. I hope this suggestion aligns better with our mutual interests.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit tight on budget. Would you be willing to consider $78? It's the best I can do, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can come to an agreement.",78.0,Bob,4,
