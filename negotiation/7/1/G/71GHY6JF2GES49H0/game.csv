"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer and your counteroffer. How about we meet at $800,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",800000.0,Alice,3,
