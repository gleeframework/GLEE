"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm willing to offer $15000.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $15000 is my minimum, I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $17500? It's a fair price that reflects both our interests.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
