Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting at $20,000, I'm setting a high bar and leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me a  bottom line and allows me to be more confident in my negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm willing to offer $15000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $15,000 is my minimum, I know the product is worth more than that to me. Accepting his offer would leave no room for profit.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's message shows he's interested in the product. This indicates a chance to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Opportunity to improve:** By rejecting, I can counter-offer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.

I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? It's a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm suggesting a compromise that's halfway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly implying that $17,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, showing that I'm open to continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $16,000 is only $1,000 away from my minimum price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While $16,000 isn't my ideal outcome, it's a good starting point.  If I reject, there's a chance Bob will stick to $16,000, forcing me to sell to John.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer saves time and avoids further negotiation rounds that might not result in a significantly better price. 

Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option for maximizing my earnings while minimizing potential risks."
