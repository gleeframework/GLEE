This is my initial offer to Bob. It's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it's important to start high to see if there's room for negotiation. 

I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial price, but I'll be mindful of the fact that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
