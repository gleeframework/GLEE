"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $140. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a great price for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $155 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference and go with $147.50? This way we both get a fair deal. ",147.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $155. However, I'm willing to give you a small concession. How about we meet at $152? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",152.0,Alice,5,
