"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price given its value to both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would allow both of us to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,250,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we want.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll counter with $1,237,500. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1237500.0,Bob,6,
