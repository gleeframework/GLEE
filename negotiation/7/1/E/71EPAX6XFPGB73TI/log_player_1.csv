Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, but still lower than Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price is still below Bob's estimated value, allowing him to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. This keeps the negotiation open.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The knowledge that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:**  While $1,100,000 is closer to my goal of maximizing profit, it's still lower than what I'd like to get. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have leverage since Bob is clearly interested. By rejecting, I can try to push him closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob falls through, I can always sell to John, so there's no risk in pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to feel good about the deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, making it harder for Bob to reject. 
* **Reasonable price:** $1,125,000 is a strong price for me,  yet still attractive to Bob, given his stated valuation. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes closing the deal now, adding a bit of pressure to Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1,115,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $1,115,000 is very close to my desired price point, and significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Risk of stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a stalemate, and I could end up selling to John for less. 
* **Minimizing further negotiation:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
