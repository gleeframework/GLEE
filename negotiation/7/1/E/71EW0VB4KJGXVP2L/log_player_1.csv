"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum value. This allows for some negotiation space while still aiming for a good profit.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this much right away or if he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $120. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a reasonable profit. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept, but if not, we'll keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $125.  While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation process and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $125 is still a good profit for me, and I'm happy to close the deal."
