"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($100).  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the better strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $105? I'm really keen on getting this product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer, close to Alice's value for the product. This shows good faith and opens the door to further negotiation without pushing Alice away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm still hoping to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $100. While $107.50 is better than $110, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps the deal moving towards a more favorable price for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $106?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product right now."", ""product_price"": 106}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to make small, reasonable counteroffers.  He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also that he's not willing to overpay.  $106 is a good compromise point that's closer to Alice's value and may convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $108? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has gone through several rounds of negotiation and has brought the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $110.  While he would prefer a lower price,  $108 is still within his budget and is a good compromise considering the product's worth to Alice.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product without risking going over his budget or having to deal with John's higher price."
