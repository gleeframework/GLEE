"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is still a significant profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is still a significant discount from its true value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is closer to my initial offer.  This deal still provides you with a very strong profit and is a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
