Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial price."

I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I believe $1,300,000 is a fair price given the product's value to Bob.  I hope we can reach an agreement soon."
