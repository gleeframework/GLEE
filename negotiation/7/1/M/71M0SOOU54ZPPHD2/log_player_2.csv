"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start significantly lower than our budget ($80) to give us room to negotiate upwards. This tactic aims to bring Alice closer to our desired price range.
* **Polite and Interested:**  We maintain a friendly and interested tone to keep the negotiation positive. Expressing interest in the product while suggesting a lower price can encourage Alice to consider our offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but $90 is still above our budget. We know we can get it for $80 from John. It's worth countering one more time to see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. How about we split the difference and settle at $75? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows willingness to compromise while moving us closer to our $80 maximum. 
* **Direct and Clear:** We're stating a specific price we're willing to pay, making it clear what we're looking for.
* **Still Below Budget:**  This offer keeps us safely below our maximum budget, allowing some wiggle room if Alice counteroffers again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount and offer it to you for $85. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85. While we could try to negotiate further, we risk her accepting our $80 offer from earlier, or refusing to budge any further. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is our maximum budget. It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
