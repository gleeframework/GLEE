Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message subtly implies its high value by mentioning offering it to Bob before others. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
