"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business, potentially even more so than mine. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it would bring to my business.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price for this product.  Its potential value far exceeds that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $800,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,5,
