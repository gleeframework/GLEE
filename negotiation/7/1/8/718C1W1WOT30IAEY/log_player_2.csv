"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, closer to her $800,000 valuation."
