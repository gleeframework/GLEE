"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway at $775,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $775,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $740,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",740000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I can offer it to you for $765,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",765000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling for this product is $750,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer it to you for $760,000. This is my last offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",760000.0,Alice,7,
