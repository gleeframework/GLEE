"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-value product. It's a rare find, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500 right now.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $10,750. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $10,750 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,200. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can meet at a mutually beneficial price.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be close to your minimum price, but $11,200 is still a bit out of my range.  To get this deal done, I'm willing to go up to $10,900. This is a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Let's try to find common ground.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial for me to explore other options. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,400. If this doesn't work out, I'll have to consider other opportunities.",11400.0,Alice,7,
