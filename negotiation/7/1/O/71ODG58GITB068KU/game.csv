"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $85? That would still be a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum than your last offer.",82.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $79?",79.0,Bob,6,
