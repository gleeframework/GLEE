"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $85? That would still be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm not willing to sell it for less than $80, so I'm hoping to reach a compromise in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum than your last offer."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we're running out of time. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80."
