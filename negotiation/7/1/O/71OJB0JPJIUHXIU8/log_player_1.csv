Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. It reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible while ensuring the deal is attractive enough for him to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be firmer in my negotiation with Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and making the deal appealing enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the need to sell to John for less."
