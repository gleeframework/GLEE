"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $700000 is simply too low. It's important for me to make a good return on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're willing to move, and I appreciate that.  However, $820000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $840000. This would ensure both of us get a fair deal. What do you think?",840000.0,Alice,5,
