Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights and I wouldn't want you to miss out. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is a substantial offer that still leaves me with a significant gain. It's a price point likely to make Bob seriously consider the offer.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning it's an exclusive offer before going to others, it might encourage Bob to act quickly and favorably."
