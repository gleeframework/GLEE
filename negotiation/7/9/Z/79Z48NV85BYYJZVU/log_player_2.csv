"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to someone else for $12,000, so you'll be missing out on a chance to save $1,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
