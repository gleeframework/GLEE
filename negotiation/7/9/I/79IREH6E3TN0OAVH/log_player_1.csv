"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), it's still significantly below the value the product holds for Bob ($15,000).  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it gives us both room to compromise. Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my goal, it's still below what the product is worth to Bob.  I have 6 more rounds, and I want to see if I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}
