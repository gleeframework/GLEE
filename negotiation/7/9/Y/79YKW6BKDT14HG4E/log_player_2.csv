"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly using pressure tactics by mentioning another buyer.  While the product might be worth $1,000,000 to you, there's no harm in seeing if you can get it for less. Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price, especially since she seems eager to sell. 

**Important Note:**  You're willing to pay $1,000,000, but your goal is to save money if possible. There's no downside to rejecting this initial offer."
