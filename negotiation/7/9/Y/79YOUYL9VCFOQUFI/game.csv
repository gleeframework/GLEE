,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $9,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
