Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message is friendly and suggests flexibility. I want Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 
* **Alternative Option (John):** I keep in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $100. This gives me leverage and a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both my minimum price and his own stated value. This suggests he's trying to negotiate a bargain. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at such a low price. I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Would you consider $120? I'm confident this product will be very valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and desire for a deal. This maintains a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Significant Counter:** I counter with $120, a $40 increase from Bob's offer but still a $30 decrease from my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm getting closer to my backup option of $100 from John. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to carefully consider my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 now matches both my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. There's no strategic advantage to further negotiation or selling to John at this point. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at my desired price."
