Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate up a little, getting us closer to our desired profit margin. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quicker might be preferable even if we make slightly less profit. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $140. We're aiming for a price that seems reasonable to him while still being profitable for us."
