"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming to the table. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget.  How about we land at $750,000?  I'm confident that this price point would make this a successful deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make it work. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers.",800000.0,Alice,5,
