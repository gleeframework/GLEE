# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make it work. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers.

This is the optimal decision. Alice has come down to her minimum price, which is still a significant savings compared to buying from John."
