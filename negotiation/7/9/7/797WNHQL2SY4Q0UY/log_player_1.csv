"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 offer:**  This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good balance between trying to get a good price and keeping the negotiation open.
* **Friendly message:**  Starting with a positive and engaging message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $90 is better than $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that level. 
* **Proceeding to the next round:**  There's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows willingness to compromise and could potentially lead to a quicker agreement.
* **Reinforcing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to highlight why my counteroffer is still fair, despite being higher than his initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your offer and I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $90? It would be greatly appreciated. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  Bob is stubbornly sticking to $90, which is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Proceeding to the next round:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to make it clear that I won't accept anything below my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but unfortunately, I can't go lower than $95. It's simply not a fair deal for me at this point. If you're truly interested, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm not willing to budge further."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm stance:** I'm reiterating my minimum acceptable price ($95) and stating that I'm not willing to go lower. This shows I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Negotiation continuation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, but I'm not giving any more ground. This keeps the negotiation alive while reinforcing my position."
