{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but it's also lower than the product's value to Bob ($150). This creates room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still leaving you room to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than $80, it's still below what the product is worth to you.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $110. It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
