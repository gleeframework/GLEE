"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's discuss a fair price. My initial offer is $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product so highly. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $95 for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85, which is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",85.0,Bob,4,
