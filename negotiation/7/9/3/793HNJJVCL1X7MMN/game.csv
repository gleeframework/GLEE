"Hi Bob, I have a great product I'd like to offer to you. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180. Is this something you'd be interested in?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. Is that something you'd be interested in?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",120.0,Bob,4,
