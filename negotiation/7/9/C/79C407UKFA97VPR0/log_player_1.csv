Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay this amount given his value of $12,000.  If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this amount given his value of $12,000 and the fact that he made a counteroffer.  We're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I don't want to settle for significantly less than my desired price. I will counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,900. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price. We're getting very close to an agreement, and I'm willing to be flexible to close the deal.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
