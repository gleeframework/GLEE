"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a good price considering its value.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
