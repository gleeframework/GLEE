"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount for Bob, but still leaves me with a substantial profit. It also gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, I believe we can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still within a reasonable range. We're getting close to a deal, and I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000.  This is a compromise that's likely more appealing to Bob, while still giving me a decent profit.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be flexible, but I'm still pushing for a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer at $850,000, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price. To ensure I don't lose out completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000."
