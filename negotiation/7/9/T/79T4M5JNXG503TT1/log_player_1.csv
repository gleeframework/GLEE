Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Strong but Polite Language:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value to Bob while still being direct about the offer. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
