{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Starting Point:** Alice's offer of $5,000 was a good starting point, but we want to make a significant counteroffer to show we're serious about negotiating.
* **Aggressive Approach:** We're going to aim for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a risky move, but it could pay off if Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** We're starting with a low offer, hoping to get Alice to meet us in the middle. We'll adjust our counteroffers based on her responses throughout the process."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice has already moved from $5,000 to $4,000. This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** We're going to increase our counteroffer slightly, showing we're willing to compromise but still aiming for a lower price. This is a more moderate approach compared to the previous round.

* **Alice's Offer:**  $4,200 is a good price, considering our budget and the negotiation progress.
* **Jhon's Price:**  $10,000 is our absolute maximum, so we're saving a significant amount by accepting Alice's offer.

**It's important to weigh the potential of further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal entirely.**"
