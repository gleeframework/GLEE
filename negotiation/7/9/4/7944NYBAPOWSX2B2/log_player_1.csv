"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to set a strong starting point and gauge Bob's interest. If he's truly interested in the product, he might be willing to negotiate down from this price.  If he rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and how many rounds are left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I have 8 rounds left, so I have some time to work with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a solid position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a bit low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's last offer. I believe this price is fair and might be tempting enough for Bob to consider.  We're getting closer to a deal with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I still have some room to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit further.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm feeling optimistic that we can close the deal at a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,450,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my flexibility and willingness to close the deal.  I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's last offer and my minimum acceptable price.  We are approaching the final rounds, so I am hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  With only two rounds left, I don't have the time to risk further negotiation.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I secure a price that meets my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of potentially getting a lower offer from Bob."
