"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Is there any flexibility in your pricing?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, that price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000? I believe that's a fair deal for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,650,000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I'm hoping we can do even better than that. Can you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I can't quite go down to $1,350,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  I believe this represents a significant discount from my original offer and reflects the product's real value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to move forward with the purchase at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to consider a final offer in the spirit of reaching an agreement. How about $1,450,000? This represents a significant concession on my part and is my best and final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'd like to propose a price of $1,250,000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
