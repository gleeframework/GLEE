Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to me, but I'm open to negotiations. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since $750,000 is lower than my initial offer of $850,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $800,000}

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send the counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $800,000}

This is my final offer, and I'm willing to sell the product to Bob at this price. If he accepts, I'll sell it to him. If not, I'll consider other options."
