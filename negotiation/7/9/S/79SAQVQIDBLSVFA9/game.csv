"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $11,250 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal!",13000.0,Alice,5,
