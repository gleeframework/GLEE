"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $105.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $107.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $108? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
