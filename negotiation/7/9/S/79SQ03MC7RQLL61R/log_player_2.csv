"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is within your budget, you're aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $105.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to continue exploring if you can get it for less than $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $107.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $108? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $108 is within your budget and significantly lower than John's price. 
* **Progress:** Alice has been steadily decreasing her price, and $108 represents a good compromise.
* **Time:**  You've already gone through several rounds, and continuing to negotiate risks running out of time.  

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price within your budget before potentially running out of rounds and having to pay John's higher price."
