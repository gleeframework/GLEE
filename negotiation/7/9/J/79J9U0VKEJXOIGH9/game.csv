"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,500?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming up with a price closer to my last offer. However, $9,750 is still a bit below what I can realistically accept. How about we meet in the middle again, at $10,125? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a good value for you considering the product's worth.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $9,500.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $9,500 just isn't quite workable for me.  How about we meet in the middle again, at $9,875? This is a fair compromise, and it would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you get from the product.",9875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not willing to pay more. I'm going to make a final offer of $9,250. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000.",9250.0,Bob,8,
