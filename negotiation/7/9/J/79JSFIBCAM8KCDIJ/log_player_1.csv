Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at Bob's maximum valuation might make him wary. A slightly lower price suggests fairness and encourages a deal.
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a secure offer from John at $800,000, providing a strong fallback position if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy balances ambition with realism, aiming to secure the best possible outcome for Alice."
