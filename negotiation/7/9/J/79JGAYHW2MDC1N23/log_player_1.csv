Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so he has room to negotiate upwards if he's interested. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  You're not just throwing out a lowball offer; you're starting at a price that reflects the value of the product.

By offering this price, you're opening the door for a successful negotiation while also ensuring that you're not leaving too much money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  You stated your minimum selling price is $8,000, and Bob's offer is only $500 above that. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to negotiate, and he has some wiggle room to go higher. 
* **You have a backup:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000, so you're not in a desperate situation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,500 is a fair price, I'm hoping we can bridge the gap a bit more.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,500). 
* **Fair and appealing:** It's still a good profit for you, and it shows you're willing to compromise. 
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and optimistic, maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $8750 is my absolute maximum. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is only $750 below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Negotiation is stalled:**  You've already made a counteroffer, and it seems like further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially take more time and energy, while you have a guaranteed offer from John that's only slightly lower.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision, as it secures a profit and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might not result in a better price."
