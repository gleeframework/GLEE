"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's  close to my minimum acceptable price of $100 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives Bob a good incentive to accept the deal, knowing the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130.  This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, hopefully encouraging him to accept while still being a profitable sale for me."
