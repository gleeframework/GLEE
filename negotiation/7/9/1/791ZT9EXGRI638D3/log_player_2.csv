"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum price point of $100. You have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between Alice's value of $80 and my maximum price of $100. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for both of us to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my maximum price, I still have more negotiation rounds left. It's worth trying to push for a lower price, especially since Alice has already rejected my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $88, which is still below my maximum price of $100 and closer to Alice's value of $80. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. It also allows for potential for Alice to counter-offer again if she wants to close the deal."
