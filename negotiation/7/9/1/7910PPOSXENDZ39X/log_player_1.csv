Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $2,000,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we want to start negotiations significantly higher. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A starting price of $2,000,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This gives us the best chance to maximize profit.
* **Confident language:** The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value and entice Bob to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
