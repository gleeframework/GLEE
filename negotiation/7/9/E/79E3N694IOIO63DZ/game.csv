"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we've discussed, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is still a great deal considering its worth to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
