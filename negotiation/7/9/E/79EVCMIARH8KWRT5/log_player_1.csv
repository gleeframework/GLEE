"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  That price is a bit too high for me though. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your budget, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
