"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $150 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $120 is not a good deal. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's find a middle ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Buying from John for $80 is the most financially sensible option."
