"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,000 is still a little steep for me. Could you do $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value.",8250.0,Alice,5,
