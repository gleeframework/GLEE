"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider coming down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a touch above my budget. Could we settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $8,000, which is the minimum I can sell the product for. If you're willing to pay that, I'm happy to move forward with the sale.",8000.0,Alice,5,
