{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for a counteroffer:**  By offering $110, I'm allowing Bob to potentially counteroffer at a price closer to his value, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to entice Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. If the negotiation drags on or seems unproductive, I'll switch to John and sell the product for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a safe option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between $90 and my minimum acceptable price. I'll likely offer something closer to $100 to incentivize Bob while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This price still gives me some room to cover my costs, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, focusing on the value he will receive.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response.  If he accepts, I've secured a sale at a price that's within my acceptable range. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to further reduce my price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $95? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer of $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of losing John:**  I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer, as he is willing to pay my minimum.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $100. I'll emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to compromise.  However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely switch to selling to John to ensure I don't miss out on a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $95 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $98?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:**  I'm offering a slight concession from my previous offer ($100) to show I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, suggesting both of us will benefit.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's make this happen!"" to potentially encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price that's close to my minimum. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and don't want to risk losing a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I won't be able to get a good deal from you. I'm willing to go up to $96, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at $96, I'll consider it a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations are stalled:**  Bob's offer of $96 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  The negotiations have stalled, and there's a risk of further back-and-forth with no resolution.
* **John is a safe alternative:** I don't want to risk continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially losing him as a buyer while also risking missing out on a guaranteed sale with John at my minimum price.
* **Minimizing losses:** By selling to John, I ensure I don't lose out on a significant amount of money.

**Next Steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale for $120. This guarantees I receive my minimum desired price for the product and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which may not lead to a successful outcome."
