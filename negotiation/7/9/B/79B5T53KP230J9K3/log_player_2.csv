{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100. This is a strong opening move, and it immediately establishes my price limit. Alice knows that if she rejects this offer, she risks losing the sale to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but closer than before. It's worth exploring further negotiations. There's a possibility that we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to continue negotiating as I believe there's still room for a better price.  I want to avoid buying from John at this point as it seems we are getting closer to a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is showing a strong willingness to negotiate, and the price is getting closer to my budget.  I'm increasing my offer to $120, which is a good compromise and reflects my belief that a deal is possible.  The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with $135. I believe we can reach a more favorable price.  There are still rounds left, and I'm confident that further negotiation will lead to a deal closer to my $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to $125,  showing continued willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable price range.  This offer is a good midpoint between our current positions and should incentivize Alice to accept.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and the risk of buying from John increases, so a deal needs to be made soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $130 is just above my preferred price of $125, but with only one round left, it's a good risk to take. Buying from John would be the safer option, but I believe there's a good chance Alice will accept my next counteroffer. However, accepting her offer guarantees I get the product and saves me the risk of going through another round of negotiation."
