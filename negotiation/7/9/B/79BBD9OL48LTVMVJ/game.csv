"Bob, I understand your persistence in trying to save as much as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you a price of $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that. If not, I'm prepared to move on to other interested buyers. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
