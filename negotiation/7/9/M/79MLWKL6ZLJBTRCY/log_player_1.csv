Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $9,500 creates a significant profit margin for Alice ($1,500) while still leaving Bob with a potential gain ($500) compared to his perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, implying that other buyers exist might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $9,500. A more aggressive approach could be to start higher (e.g., $9,800) and leave room for negotiation. However, this carries a higher risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
