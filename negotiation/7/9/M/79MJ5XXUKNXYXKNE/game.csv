"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would still be a good deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $9,800 is still quite a bit below what I need.  How about $10,200?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would still be a great deal for you given the value you've placed on the product.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I think it's still a great value for you given the benefits of the product.",10000.0,Alice,7,
