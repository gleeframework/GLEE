,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is my absolute minimum. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
