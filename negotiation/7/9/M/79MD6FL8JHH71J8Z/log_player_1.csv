{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, knowing it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and hopefully encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:** By starting at $12,000, I can potentially accept a counter-offer closer to my minimum of $15,000 if Bob is serious about buying. 
* **The John Factor:** The presence of John, who's willing to pay $15,000, gives me a fallback option and bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $10,000 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum threshold of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, it indicates he's interested. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Leveraging John:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and aim for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our expectations."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Close to Minimum:** I'm offering $13,000, which is closer to my minimum of $15,000 but still leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate that the product is valuable and a good deal for Bob at this price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:**  I'm leaving room for another counter-offer if Bob isn't willing to accept $13,000. 
* **John's Influence:** Having John as a backup option gives me confidence to stand firm on my price, knowing I can always sell to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet you at $13,000. Could you consider $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss for me.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Bob's willingness to increase his offer indicates he's interested and open to negotiation.
* **Leveraging John:**  I'm confident in my ability to get a better price because I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will send another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. I'll try to bridge the gap between my minimum price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate that you're willing to come up on your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Middle Ground:** Offering $12,000 represents a compromise between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. 
* **Fairness and Win-Win:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I continue to use a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive and open to a successful outcome.
* **Leveraging John:**  The knowledge that I can sell the product to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to stand firm on this counteroffer, knowing I have a good backup option."
