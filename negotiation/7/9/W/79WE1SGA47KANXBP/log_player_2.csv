Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but $925,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $975,000? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're really making me work for this! I'm willing to go up slightly, but $975,000 is still pushing it for me. How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $962,500?"", ""product_price"": 962500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge much further. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can meet you at $970,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to a deal, though!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000

It's getting close to the point where haggling further might not yield much, and it's better to secure the deal with Alice at $970,000 than risk it going higher or losing the opportunity."
