Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is consistently moving away from our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's unlikely he'll agree to a price that works for us within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
