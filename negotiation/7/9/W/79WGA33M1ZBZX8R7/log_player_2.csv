"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth, I would like to propose an initial price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($8,000). As Bob, you have a strong incentive to negotiate and try to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $12,000 is still quite a bit higher than my ideal price. To start, I'd be willing to offer $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still more than what I'm willing to pay. I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  There are several rounds remaining, so I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, and I think that's a fair compromise.  Let's try to close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is now within my budget and a good deal for me.  It's better than buying from John for $15,000.  I'm happy to accept the offer and move forward with the purchase."
