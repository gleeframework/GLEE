"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a product worth $15,000 to you for a lower price, and I get a higher price than I'd get from another buyer.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
