"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a product worth $15,000 to you for a lower price, and I get a higher price than I'd get from another buyer.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
