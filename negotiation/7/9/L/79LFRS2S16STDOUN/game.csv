"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10500 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'd be happy to pay $9500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I could find a buyer for it if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
