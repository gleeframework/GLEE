Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so $14,000 is a compelling offer that saves him money. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, which serves as a safety net. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I increase my chances of securing a deal closer to Bob's higher valuation."
