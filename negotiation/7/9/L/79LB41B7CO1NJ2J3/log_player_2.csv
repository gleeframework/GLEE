"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($14,000)** is within your budget of $15,000. 
* **Buying from Alice saves you $1,000** compared to buying from John. 

Even though you could pay more and buy from John, getting the product for a lower price is always more advantageous."
