Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still a good deal for Bob as it's significantly less than his perceived value, but it's also a decent increase from Bob's offer.  This gives us more room to negotiate and hopefully find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum and it's getting late in the negotiation.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that's a decent profit for me. There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price with more negotiation, but the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price is too high."
