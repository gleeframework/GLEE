"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000. Even though you have a backup option with John for $15,000, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice.  You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to her. This shows a willingness to negotiate while aiming for a good deal. It's likely Alice will counter, but we'll see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your target. While buying from John is an option, you can likely secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get the best deal possible. This is a small increase, aiming to find a middle ground and potentially finalize the purchase with Alice."
