"Alice,  $1,800,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite low for what I'm offering. Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
