"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This allows room for negotiation and leaves me with a good margin above my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's at my minimum price.  I'm hoping to get a better price, but I'm also willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm offering $18,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate further, hoping for a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have 6 rounds left and potentially more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $16,000, which is still above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is getting increasingly difficult. Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum price, and the risk of not reaching a mutually agreeable deal is getting higher. It's time to take the secure option and sell to John for $15,000."
