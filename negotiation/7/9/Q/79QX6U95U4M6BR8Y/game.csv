"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850000 is a bit too low for me considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm offering $900000 as my final counteroffer. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the best I can do.",900000.0,Alice,3,
