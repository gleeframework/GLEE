Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you like the perks. I'm willing to meet you at $680,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway from here.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is showing signs of potential compromise, but her latest offer is still a bit high. By rejecting and countering one more time, we can gauge her true willingness to negotiate. If she doesn't budge significantly in the next round, it might be time to consider John's offer."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm also invested in finding a solution that works for both of us. To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to move up to $675,000. This is a significant jump for me, and I believe it represents a fair compromise considering the overall value."", 
""product_price"": 675000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're holding firm at our previous counteroffer of $675,000. This serves two purposes:

* **Signaling Seriousness:**  By repeating our offer, we emphasize that we are serious about this price and not just lowballing.
* **Gauging Alice's Resolve:**  Alice's language suggests she might be getting anxious about the negotiation stalling. Holding firm will reveal if she's truly willing to meet us closer to our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move up to $675,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. Considering we're so close, I'm willing to meet you at $677,500. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $677,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $677,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $900,000. A final price of $677,500 represents a substantial saving.
* **Final Offer:** She has explicitly stated this is her final concession.  Trying to push further might make her walk away entirely.
* **Time Constraint:**  This is round 9, leaving only one round left. The risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the deal outweighs the relatively small potential savings of pushing for $675,000."
