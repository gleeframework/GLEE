,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $750,000.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $750,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much. My revised offer is $700,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, the additional perks are definitely appealing, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $675,000, including the perks?  It seems like a fair deal for both of us.",675000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you like the perks. I'm willing to meet you at $680,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway from here.",680000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm also invested in finding a solution that works for both of us. To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to move up to $675,000. This is a significant jump for me, and I believe it represents a fair compromise considering the overall value.",675000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move up to $675,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. Considering we're so close, I'm willing to meet you at $677,500. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",677500.0,Alice,9,
