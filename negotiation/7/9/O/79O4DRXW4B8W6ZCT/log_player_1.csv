I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves me with a good profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $13,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $14,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, but still allows me to make a decent profit. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. The risk of going back and forth and ultimately losing the deal is too high. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is my minimum and ensures I'm not losing out on a profitable deal."
