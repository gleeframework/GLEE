Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has immense value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $2,000,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's far below what I need to make this deal work. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept a price that undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground. My counteroffer is $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's features and potential benefits, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'll try to get a higher price from Bob, but I need to be mindful of the limited rounds. If we don't reach an agreement soon, selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $800,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,000,000.  This offer reflects the significant value this product offers, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
