"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own costs. Let's see if we can find common ground.
