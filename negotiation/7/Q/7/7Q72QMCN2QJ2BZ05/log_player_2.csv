"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  How does $10,000 sound?  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price as well. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $10,000
* **Your Value:** $12,000
* **John's Price:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.  Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy at John's higher price isn't worth it."
