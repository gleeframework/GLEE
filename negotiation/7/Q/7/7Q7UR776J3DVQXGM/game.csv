"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm happy to discuss this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let's start there.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand that $22,000 was a high starting point, but $12,000 is considerably lower than I can accept. This product offers unique value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",15000.0,Bob,4,
