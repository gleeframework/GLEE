"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its high quality and value, I believe it's worth $90. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming to pay no more than $100 and her offer is too high. You can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $85? I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'd like to keep the price closer to my valuation for now. How about $88? It still allows us to share the value we see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is within your budget and closer to your desired price point. Accepting the offer is the best decision at this point, as continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and needing to buy from John for a higher price."
