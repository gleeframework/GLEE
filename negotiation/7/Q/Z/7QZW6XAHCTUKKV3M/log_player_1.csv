"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let's start the negotiation! "", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider a lower price, around $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I want to try and squeeze more out of the negotiation, and hopefully, I can get closer to my goal of $800,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $650,000 is too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about meeting in the middle at $725,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $725,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher number. I'm not desperate to sell and am confident that I can get closer to my target with a few more rounds of negotiation.  There's still a lot of room for both of us to find a middle ground. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my last offer, but still higher than Bob's."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $725,000 is still a bit low. Let's try $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
