Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However,  $7,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her value:** Alice has come down to $8,000, which you know is the value of the product to her. She's unlikely to go any lower.
* **You're getting a good deal:** You're buying the product for $2,000 less than your maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:** While you might try to push for a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will agree, and you risk losing the deal entirely. 

Accepting the offer now secures you a good price and avoids the potential of having to settle for John's offer later."
