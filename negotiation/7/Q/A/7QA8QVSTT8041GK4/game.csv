"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However,  $7,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. ",8000.0,Alice,5,
