"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  How about $11,000?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
