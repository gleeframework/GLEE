"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you say?",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit shy of $87.50. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",82.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference again and go with $84.50? It's a fair compromise and lets us both move forward.  What do you think?",84.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $84.50 is the best price. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price.",80.0,Bob,8,
