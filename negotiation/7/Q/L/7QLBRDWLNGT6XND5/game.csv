"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my range.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
