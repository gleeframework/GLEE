"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than John's price of $10,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my range."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than John's price of $10,000, and it's a compromise that shows Alice is willing to negotiate. Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product at a lower price than he initially expected."
