"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $13,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, but there's still room for negotiation.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* A counteroffer of $11,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves some room for negotiation.
* This offer is still higher than Alice's minimum value of $12,000, so there's a chance she will accept it.
* If Alice rejects, Bob can continue to negotiate and adjust his offer based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and closer to her initial price. This suggests she's not willing to budge significantly.
* However, Bob still has room to negotiate and get a better price than John's offer.
* Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer in Round 3 shows she's willing to negotiate slightly.
* Offering $12,000 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* This offer is still within Bob's budget and also aligns with Alice's minimum value, increasing the chance of acceptance. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can reassess his strategy based on her behavior."
