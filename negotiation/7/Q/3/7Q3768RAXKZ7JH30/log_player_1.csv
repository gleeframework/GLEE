Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation. It also leaves some room for me to potentially lower the price a bit if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to get a bit impatient, Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves me some profit. It's also closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet me halfway, and I've already made several compromises.  It's time to move on and sell to John.  While I would have preferred to get a better price, at least this guarantees I get my minimum desired value."
