Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go to $8,500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below John's offer of $8,000.  She's already indicated that $8,500 is her lowest point to avoid a loss. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result than what's already guaranteed with John."
