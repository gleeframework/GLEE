Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so I can aim higher with Bob."
