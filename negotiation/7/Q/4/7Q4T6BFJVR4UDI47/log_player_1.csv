Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $15,000. It's a great deal for something worth significantly more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, aiming to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I have 8 rounds left and a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so I'm not desperate. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still a little low for me. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while stating my reason for rejecting it. This helps keep the negotiation polite and shows I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Midpoint Compromise:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and optimistic, hoping to maintain a positive negotiating environment.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually agreeable price while still achieving a good outcome for me."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  I'm not desperate to sell, as John is a backup option, and we have 6 rounds left. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Progress Acknowledged:**  I acknowledge Bob's progress towards my desired price point to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Final Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm committed to closing the deal.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.

This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach a mutually acceptable price before potentially accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $12900 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,900 is only $100 less than my last counteroffer and is very close to my minimum price point.  Given that we have only 4 rounds remaining, I believe it's better to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's $10,000 offer."
