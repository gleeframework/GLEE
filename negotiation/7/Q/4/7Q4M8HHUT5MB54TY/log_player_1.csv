Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price a bit more, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept anything below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
