"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value is $800000 to you. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. While I understand its significance to you, I believe we can find a price that respects both our interests. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $700000 is a significant improvement from my initial offer, I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering the product's true value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $750000. This price takes into account your budget and market conditions, while still recognizing the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your effort in meeting halfway, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline the offer at $750000. Given my financial constraints and the fact that the product's value to me is closer to $800000, I am unable to agree to this price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $780000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you can consider, while also respecting my budget.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm still not willing to let the product go for $780000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $765000. This price takes into account your budget and the product's value to you, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",765000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I must respectfully decline the offer at $765000. While I understand the balance you're trying to achieve, I'm still unable to agree to this price given my financial situation and the perceived value of the product to me. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $795000. This is my maximum acceptable price, considering all the factors involved. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $795000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to earn a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $765000 and $795000. I'm proposing a final counteroffer of $780000. This is my best and final offer. If you're unable to accept, I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer.",780000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I understand your position and the value you place on the product. However, I'm still unable to agree to the price of $780000 based on my financial constraints and the perceived value of the product to me. I believe we have reached a point where further negotiation might not lead to a mutually satisfactory outcome. Therefore, I will proceed to purchase the product from John for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,8,
