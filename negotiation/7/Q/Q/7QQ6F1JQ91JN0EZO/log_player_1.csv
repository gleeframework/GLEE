"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly less than the value to Bob but still leaves me a comfortable profit. 
* **Positive and open:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $12,000 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still securing a good profit. 
* **Setting the stage:** This offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and $10,000 is still below my target profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I have a strong negotiating position because the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I can afford to reject this offer and continue negotiating.
* **Risk of Losing to John:** While selling to John is an option, it's not ideal. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate but not giving away too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This still gives me a fair return and allows you to get a great deal on this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counter-offer is a compromise, showing flexibility while remaining close to my desired price point.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  $11,000 still represents a significant profit for me.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob of the potential benefits he'll receive.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains friendly and positive, creating a conducive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend.  How about $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  $10,500 is only slightly lower than my previous offer and is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiations:**  The longer the negotiations go, the greater the risk of either Bob backing out completely or me losing the deal to John.
* **Time is Money:**  While I would have preferred a higher price, $10,500 is a good return considering the limited rounds remaining and the potential loss to John. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale."
