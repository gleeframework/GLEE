"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum value, I'd like to try and get a bit more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting lower, I still want to try and get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is only $5 more than Bob's last offer, but it's still above my minimum. It shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting too low, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
