Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm only willing to pay somewhere in the range of $10,000.  What's the lowest you could go?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, $10,000 is significantly below its worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I can tell this product means a lot to you and I respect that you have a bottom line.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle at $13,750?

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, we're running out of rounds. He's consistently aiming for the middle ground, and it's unlikely he'll reach our $15,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. John provides a guaranteed sale at our desired price. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed deal."
