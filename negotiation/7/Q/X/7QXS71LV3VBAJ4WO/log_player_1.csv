"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point. While Bob values the product at $800,000, I need to make a profit and am confident it's worth more than that to him. This initial offer leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than my floor price of $1,200,000.  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still allows me to make a profit while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay a higher price than his initial valuation. It's a fair compromise and a strong position to start this round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my floor price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. There's a decent chance Bob will be willing to go higher, and I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer and shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him. I believe this price is a good compromise and still allows me to make a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum price.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round, and I've already conceded a lot.  This decision ensures I secure a profit without risking further negotiation."
