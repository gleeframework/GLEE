"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a better chance of reaching a higher final price. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,900,000, we're setting a high anchor point in Bob's mind. Even if he counters lower, the initial high price might influence his perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving John as Leverage:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John) gives us a strong position. We're not desperate to make a deal below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value it holds, my budget is limited to $1,200,000. I believe we can find a price that works for both of us within this range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). While his message suggests a willingness to negotiate, accepting his initial offer would be a considerable loss. We have room to negotiate and leverage our alternative buyer, John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise, reflecting my desire to find a solution that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** We're decreasing our asking price by $150,000, a substantial amount that might signal flexibility to Bob. However, we're still well above both his offer and our minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's benefits and potential ROI for Bob, reinforcing its worth beyond just the price tag.
* **Framing as Compromise:**  By explicitly stating this is a compromise, we aim to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this brings us closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away entirely. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the potential for a stalled negotiation."
