"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a relatively high price, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me some leverage.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open Ended Question:** I'm asking Bob what he thinks, inviting him to engage in the conversation and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  Even though $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe the product is worth more. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Exploring Options:**  By moving to the next round, I can gauge Bob's true interest and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some wiggle room."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price.
* **Fair Value:**  $125 is still a good price for me, considering my minimum value of $100. 
* **Motivating Language:** I'm highlighting the value for Bob by calling it a ""great deal.""
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, suggesting that this price is ""still a great deal"" for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?  That way, we both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob's offer of $112.50 is getting closer to my desired price range. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether. Accepting this offer ensures I make a decent profit while avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiations."
