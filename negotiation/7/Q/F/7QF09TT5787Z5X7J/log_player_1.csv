Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high but stay realistic. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so starting closer to that figure maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a strong backup plan with John at $800,000, ensuring we won't lose money if Bob declines.

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, giving us the best chance to secure the highest possible price."
