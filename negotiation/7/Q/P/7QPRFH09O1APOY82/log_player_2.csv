"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum selling price and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $12,500 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $13,500. This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.
