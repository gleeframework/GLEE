"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $12,500 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $13,500. This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
