"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $17000?",17000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. $19000 is still a little high for me. Let's try $18000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",18000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $18000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $18500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",18500.0,Alice,5,
