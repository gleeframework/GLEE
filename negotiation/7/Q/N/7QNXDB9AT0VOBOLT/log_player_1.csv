This offer is a starting point for negotiation.  It leaves room for Bob to counter, but it's also significantly higher than what I'd get from John, so it's still a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I believe we can find a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
