Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I know it will be worth it for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit above your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your potential profit:**  $11,500 is closer to Bob's perceived value, increasing the chance of a quick sale.
* **Keep the option open:**  If Bob rejects, you can still counter or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired profit margin. Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to your target of $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $11,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there. How about $10,750?  That's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still a bit lower than you'd prefer. You have two things working in your favor:

1. **You're already above your minimum:**  If negotiations fall apart, you can still sell to John for $10,000.
2. **Bob seems willing to negotiate:**  He's made multiple counteroffers, showing a desire to reach an agreement.

Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap further."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,875? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10875}
