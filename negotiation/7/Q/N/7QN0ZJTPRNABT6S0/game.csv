"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a nice product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $65 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. That's still a great value for you, and it gives me a chance to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $75 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say?",80.0,Alice,5,
