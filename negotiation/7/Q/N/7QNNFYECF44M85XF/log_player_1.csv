Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While Bob has shown interest, we're not close enough to a price I'm comfortable with, and I only have 4 rounds left.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and it's important to be realistic about the potential to secure a higher price in the remaining rounds."
