Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, you don't know his budget or other purchasing factors. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will help you reach an optimal outcome."
