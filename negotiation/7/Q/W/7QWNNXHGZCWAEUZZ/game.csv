"Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to the middle ground we're looking for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $900000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $925000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
