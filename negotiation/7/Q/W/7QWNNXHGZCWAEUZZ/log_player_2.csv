Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the market. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to the middle ground we're looking for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $900000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $925000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your ideal price but within your budget of $800,000.
* You have already made multiple counteroffers and it seems Alice is also willing to negotiate.
* Accepting the offer secures the product and saves you the time and effort of further negotiation. 
* While you could try to get a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer again, and you could end up buying from John at a higher price.
* Accepting now allows you to finalize the deal within your budget and avoid potential delays."
