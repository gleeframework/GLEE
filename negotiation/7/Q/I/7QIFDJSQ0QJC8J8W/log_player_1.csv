Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because you know John will buy the product for $800,000. This gives you leverage.
* **Bob's Position:** The product's value to Bob is equal to your minimum acceptable price. This means there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal, but pushing too hard could make him walk away.

**Strategy**

The key is to balance ambition with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.

**Possible Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $950,000 aims high. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""significant benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's value and provides a reason for the higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price between $800,000 and $950,000.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but no lower than $850,000). 
* **Market Conditions:** If similar products are selling for significantly more than $800,000, you could justify an even higher initial offer. 

**Remember, negotiation is about finding a mutually acceptable agreement. Good luck!**"
