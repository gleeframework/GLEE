"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:**  The product is now priced at $11,000, which is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **There's potential for further savings:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with.
* **Buying from John is less advantageous:** Buying from John would cost $15,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $4,000."
