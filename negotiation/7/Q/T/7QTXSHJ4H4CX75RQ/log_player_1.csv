"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While $1,300,000 represents a fair price considering the value this product brings, I understand your position. Let's meet halfway - how about $1,150,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While $1,075,000 is a good profit, we're still significantly below his perceived value. There's room to push for a higher price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  While I'm a bit hesitant to go lower, I value our negotiation. How about $1,115,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1115000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility, but stand firm:** We acknowledge Bob's efforts (""appreciate your willingness"") but signal some resistance (""a bit hesitant"").
* **Small concession:** The drop to $1,115,000 is smaller than Bob's previous jumps, indicating we're reaching the upper limit.
* **Positive language:** ""Fair compromise"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal even if it's not his ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. To make this work for me, I need to be at $1,090,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the limit:**  Bob's concessions are getting smaller, indicating we're pushing his price limit. 
* **Strong profit:** $1,090,000 is a $290,000 profit, a substantial return.  
* **Time value:** Dragging negotiations out carries the risk of Bob walking away or offering even less.  Taking the solid offer now is preferable."
