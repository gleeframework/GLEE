"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a price that's profitable for me.  It also sets a starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still within the first half of the rounds.  I'm going to continue to negotiate to see if I can get even closer to my target of $150.  If I can't, I'll consider selling to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm making a small counteroffer, showing flexibility.  It's still above my minimum and gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also puts pressure on him to make a decision.  We're getting close to a potential deal, so I'm keeping the price close to his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  We've only got 4 rounds left, so I want to see if I can get closer to $150, and possibly even close a deal with Bob. If the next few rounds don't yield a better offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price again, showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise.  However, I'm keeping it above my minimum acceptable price and hoping that he'll recognize that we're getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the last two rounds.  While I'd still prefer to sell to Bob for $150, the risk of him rejecting my next offer and then not being able to sell it to John for the same price is too high.  With John's offer of $150, I'm guaranteed to make a profit."
