"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal for something worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price closer to his limit, but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Alice he's serious about buying, but also signals his willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $11,500.  It's still a good deal for a product you value at $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his target than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than his desired price.  Rejecting and counter-offering again keeps the negotiation going and gives him a chance to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, showing a willingness to compromise.  Offering $11,000 demonstrates a genuine attempt to find a middle ground. It's likely that Alice might accept this offer, but if not, there's still room to negotiate in the remaining rounds."
