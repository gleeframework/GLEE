Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $815,000, but I think that's the best I can do. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While we could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $815,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's original offer and John's price."
