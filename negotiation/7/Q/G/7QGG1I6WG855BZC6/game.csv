"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable paying $15,000. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your honest feedback. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000, as I still think the product is worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $15,500. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
