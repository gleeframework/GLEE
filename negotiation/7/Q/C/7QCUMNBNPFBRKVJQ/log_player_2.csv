"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110, which is a special introductory price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $120.  You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for your exact limit, so there's room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $120.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget, Bob. I'm glad we're working towards a mutual agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $112.50. This allows some savings for you while ensuring I receive a fair value for my product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your target price, but it's still above your budget.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $112.50 is still a bit above my limit.  Let's aim for $114.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 114}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to offer the product for $113. This price allows a slight adjustment that should suit both of our needs. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $113
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $113 is the closest she's come to your budget, and you only have 5 rounds left.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible and you might end up paying more than $113.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids any potential delays or difficulties in the remaining rounds."
