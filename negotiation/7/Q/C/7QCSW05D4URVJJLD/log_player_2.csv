# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. It's a valuable asset that could significantly benefit your business. While I'm happy to sell it to you at this price, I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
