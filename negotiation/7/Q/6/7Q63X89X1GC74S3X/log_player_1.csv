{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value. It also emphasizes the benefit to Bob, potentially encouraging acceptance. However, if Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while being within your budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is willing to negotiate, his counteroffers are still too low for me to make a satisfactory profit. I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome."
