Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Based on its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum.  This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:**  A positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's a clear understanding that this is an opening offer and we can adjust based on Bob's response.
* **Plan B:**  The offer includes the option to stop negotiating and sell to John, ensuring I can still get my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than Bob's value:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I consider the product's worth.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room to increase the price further. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a buyer ensures I won't be forced to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the product's true value and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  This is a common negotiation tactic, showing willingness to compromise while still keeping the price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the product's ""true value"" strengthens my position and subtly pushes Bob to see the price as reasonable.
* **Compromise tone:** The message is polite and acknowledges Bob's counteroffer, making it less likely to be rejected outright.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer still leaves some room to negotiate down if Bob insists, but it puts me in a stronger position than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your offer, I believe we can reach a fair compromise. My counteroffer is $960000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price range. 
* **Risk of losing deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether, especially as his counteroffers are getting closer to his perceived value.
* **Time is money:**  Each round of negotiation takes time and energy.  Accepting this offer secures a good price without further delays.
* **John as backup:**  The option to sell to John for $1,200,000 is still available if I'm not happy with the final deal. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I can close the deal quickly and secure a solid profit, while still having the security of John's offer as a fallback option if needed."
