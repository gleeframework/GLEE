Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going all-in with my first offer, allowing for some back-and-forth to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails. I can always walk away and still get my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,150,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Counteroffers:** While Bob's offer is lower, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John is a Safe Backup:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not taking unnecessary risks."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Maintain Value:**  I'm offering a counter-offer that is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Clear and Concise Message:** I'm keeping my message direct and focused on the benefits of the deal for both of us, aiming to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining the Advantage:** I'm still leaving a slight gap between my offer and my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some flexibility in case Bob makes another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While we're getting closer, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. Another round of counteroffers could drag on and may not result in a deal closer to my desired value.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of wasting time and potentially missing out on the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 
* **John Offers a Secure Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees I achieve my minimum desired value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
