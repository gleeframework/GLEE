"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $100?  That would be a good price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $110 to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $98. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can still make a profit.  What do you say?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure about $98, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $95. How about $97? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.0,Bob,6,
