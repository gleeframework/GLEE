{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, leaving room for negotiation while still guaranteeing you a profit. It also presents a positive and encouraging message to Bob, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $100?  That would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $110 to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $98. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can still make a profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $98, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $95. How about $97? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $97 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since I'm running out of time and I have a guaranteed sale from John for $120, I will sell the product to John."
