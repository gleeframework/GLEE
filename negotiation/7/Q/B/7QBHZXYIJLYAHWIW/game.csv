"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $162.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",162.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $162.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $140. This would be a good deal for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to move closer to your offer. How about we meet at $152? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings.",152.0,Alice,5,
