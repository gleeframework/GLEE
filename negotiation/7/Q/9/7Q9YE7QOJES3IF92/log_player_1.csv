Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for potential profit above your minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Offering it at $1,400,000 creates a substantial perceived gain for him if he accepts.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other buyers and a time limit, you incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out on a ""good deal.""

This strategy balances securing a high sale price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
