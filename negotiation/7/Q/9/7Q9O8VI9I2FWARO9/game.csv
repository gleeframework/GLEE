"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget to work with. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the product. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is still a little above what I can do right now. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
