"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at a price that gives me a healthy profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit for me. I hope Bob will see the value of the product and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I have a few more rounds before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to persuade Bob to accept, but I'm also getting closer to my ""sell to John"" threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $10,500. I'm hoping this small compromise will be enough to finally get him to accept.  If he rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to be realistic. While I'd still prefer to get a bit more from Bob, his last offer is too low.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. It's not my ideal profit, but it's still a secure sale that meets my minimum requirements."
