"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. We're aiming for under $80, but there's a good chance Alice won't go that low immediately. This offer gives us space to negotiate upwards while still staying within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see if I can meet you in the middle. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. Let's see if we can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  How about we settle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're getting closer! This offer is just below our max and leaves a little room for Alice to counter if she's really determined to get a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I can do $85, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not going any lower than that. Can you meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is holding firm, and $85 is within our budget. It's a better deal than John's offer, so we should take it."
