"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I've done some research as well, and I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and your interest. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $1300000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with the price going up to $1350000. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is closer to my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $1290000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
