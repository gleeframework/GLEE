This offer gives me a good profit, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay more than my minimum price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I'm confident this price is still beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
