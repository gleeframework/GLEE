{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been trying to work with Bob, but we're not getting any closer to an agreement. I'm only two rounds away from my deadline, and I'm not confident I can get a price I'm happy with.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $120.  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, getting a better price from John is the best option at this point."
