"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations. I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it provides and my own financial limitations. Please let me know if you're willing to discuss this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the significant benefits the product will bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm firmly committed to $800,000. This represents the maximum I can afford while still making this investment worthwhile. I believe this is a fair price given the value it brings, and I'm confident it will ultimately benefit both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I recognize our valuations are quite different, and I respect your position.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still too much for me.  I'm firmly committed to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.  Let's find a way to make this work, or I'll have to look at other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
