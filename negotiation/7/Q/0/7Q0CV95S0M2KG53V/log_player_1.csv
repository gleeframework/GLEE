Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly unique."",
""product_price"": 1150000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Limit:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I need to offer a price that's enticing but also maximizes my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter with a lower offer, and we could potentially settle somewhere above his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  I have a safety net with John. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product for my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
