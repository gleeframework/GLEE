"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be a fair compromise.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired selling point.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
