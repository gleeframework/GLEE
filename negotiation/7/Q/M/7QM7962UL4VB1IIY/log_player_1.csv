{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but still lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep Bob interested.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving space for negotiation and a possible counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150 and even lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Potential for better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150, which is still my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140. That's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price but still staying above Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking if he's interested.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still securing a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. While it's closer to my previous counteroffer, it's not a price I'm willing to accept. 
* **Risk of further concessions:** If I accept, I risk setting a precedent for lower prices and might not be able to secure a better deal in future negotiations.
* **Selling to John is a safer option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150. This ensures I don't lose out on a profitable deal.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make another counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground that is more acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $110 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $130 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final compromise.  I'm lowering the price to $130, which is still above my minimum acceptable value of $150.  
* **Clear Message:** I'm being clear that $130 is my final offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a good deal for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually acceptable price while ensuring I don't sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $130 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $115. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $115 is still below my minimum. 
* **Risk of further concessions:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further concessions and a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150. This ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

Given the current situation, selling to John is the most strategic decision. It guarantees a profitable sale and eliminates the risk of further concessions that might lead to a lower final price."
