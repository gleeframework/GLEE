"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $800,000. However, considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I hope you'll consider this revised offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you a price of $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I hope you'll consider this revised offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $950,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
