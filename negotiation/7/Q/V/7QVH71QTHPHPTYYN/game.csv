"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm afraid I need to maintain a higher price point to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to compromise, though! I can offer you the product for $850000. This is a one-time deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better opportunity elsewhere. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $775000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though! I can offer you the product for $825000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but I'm afraid I need to stick to my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $775000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it.",775000.0,Bob,6,
