,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $95 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell the product to you for $105. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I really appreciate your flexibility. $105 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my offer of $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer at a higher price if you need to.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $102.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm really close to accepting your offer, but $102.50 is still a little too high for me. My final offer is $95. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to buy it from John instead.",95.0,Bob,8,
