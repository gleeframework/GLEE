"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You can get the product for $12,000 from Alice, saving $3,000 compared to John's price. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You value the product at $15,000, Alice at $10,000. This means there's a potential for a price between $10,000 and $15,000 that would be beneficial to both of you.  
* **Rejecting and counteroffering allows you to potentially save more money.** You can try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Meeting halfway:** It offers a price halfway between Alice's value ($10,000) and your maximum value ($15,000).
* **Potential for compromise:** It signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant price reduction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still better than buying from John.** It's only $500 more than your initial counteroffer, and still saves you $2,500 compared to John's price.
* **Further negotiation may not be fruitful.** Alice has already rejected a lower offer, and it's possible she won't budge further.
* **The risk of waiting is not worth it.**  While further negotiation could lead to a lower price, it's also possible that Alice will walk away, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting this offer, you secure the product for a price that's within your budget and significantly cheaper than the alternative."
