"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this excellent product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" to justify the high initial price, even though it's above what Bob might consider. 
* **Openness:** Expressing openness to hearing Bob's thoughts makes the approach less aggressive and encourages him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably higher than Bob's perceived value of the product ($800,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation. We're aiming to secure a price closer to $2,000,000 if possible. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a more favorable agreement. We're still far above John's offer, so we have some leeway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $2,000,000. I think this is a fair offer considering its unique benefits."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between our initial asking price and Bob's offer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reinforces the product's value, hoping to subtly anchor Bob's perception closer to our price.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The tone is still professional and collaborative, but with a hint of firmness to show we're not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $2,000,000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but $1,600,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price. We need to hold firm to try and get a better deal. We're getting closer to John's offer, so the next round will be crucial in determining if we can reach an agreement with Bob or need to proceed with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is a significant drop from my previous offer, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're getting close to our walk-away point. By stating this is our final offer, we're adding a sense of urgency and signaling that we're serious about closing the deal at this price or moving on.
* **Slight Concession:** Coming down to $1,900,000 shows some flexibility but maintains a price significantly above Bob's offer and our absolute minimum.
* **Value Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price, even though we're nearing the end of the negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:**  While not explicitly stated, the message implies that we might explore other options (like John's offer) if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll propose $1,450,000. This is my best and final offer, I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,450,000 is below John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While we could try to negotiate further with Bob, his ""best and final"" stance suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting John's offer ensures we get a price we know is guaranteed and avoids the risk of Bob not budging."
