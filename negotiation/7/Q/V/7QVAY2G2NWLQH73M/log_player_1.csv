"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or, if necessary, sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105 to try and make this work.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob or I can always sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  Let's split the difference.  I'll drop to $100 for the product. This is a great price for you, and it ensures I get a fair deal as well."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a bit more savings. Would you be willing to meet me at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I want to get as close to my desired price as possible before considering selling to John. I have more negotiation rounds and can still potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting really close here. I'm willing to go down to $99. Let's make this deal and both be happy."", ""product_price"": 99}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. Would you be willing to meet me at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are at the 8th round of negotiations. While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, we are nearing a point where the difference in price is minimal. With only two rounds left, it's likely we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John for $120 ensures I get the highest possible price and guarantees a sale."
