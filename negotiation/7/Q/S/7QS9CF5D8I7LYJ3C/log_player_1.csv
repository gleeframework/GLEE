Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000.

This is a reasonable compromise that still allows you to benefit from the product while also recognizing its value to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle somewhere in the middle, say $700,000? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your desire to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.

This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
