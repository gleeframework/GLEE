Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. Bob has shown interest and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $125 is a fair compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and further negotiation might not yield a much better result."
