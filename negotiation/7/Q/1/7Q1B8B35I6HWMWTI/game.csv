"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be a perfect fit for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still fair.  Let's say $12,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe you'll find it to be a very valuable asset. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
