"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's tempting to consider, it's better to stick to your financial limit. You can get the same product from John for a lower price, making that the more financially sound choice."
