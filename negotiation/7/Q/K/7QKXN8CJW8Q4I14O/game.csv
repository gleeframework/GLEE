"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm offering it to you at a competitive price of $1200000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value this product can bring.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential value in your product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is a fair price, it's not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $950000 to facilitate this deal. This price reflects the value I know this product will bring to your company. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is closer, but still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $850000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing discussion. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
