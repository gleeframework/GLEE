"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1100000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both room to close the deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
