Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This represents a substantial savings for you while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've chosen $1,250,000 as my offer. This is a good starting point because it:
    *  Is significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob.
    *  Is significantly more than what I can get from John.
* **Message:** The message is polite and informative, highlighting the potential value to Bob while emphasizing the fair return for me. 
* **Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and I can then adjust based on the situation. 

This approach aims to maximize my profit while keeping Bob interested in the deal."
