# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal as the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer is lower than her product value, you can get a better deal from John for $8,000. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding with your backup plan to buy from John."
