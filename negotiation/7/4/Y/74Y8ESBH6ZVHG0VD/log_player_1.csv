"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $11,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the response. I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. Would you consider $13,000? I feel that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm seeing we both value this product.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $15,500.  I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, we are now at Round 6 and he is still $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll bridge that gap quickly enough to make continuing negotiations worthwhile. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which meets my needs. It's time to cut my losses and secure the sale with John."
