"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you given its value to you stands at $15,000. I understand the importance of making this transaction beneficial for both parties. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $12,000. This price not only ensures a fair deal for you by capturing a significant portion of the product's value but also allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to hearing your response and hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies us both.",12000.0,Alice,1,
