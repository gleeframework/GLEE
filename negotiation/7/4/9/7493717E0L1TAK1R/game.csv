"Hi Alice,  $2000000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This allows both of us to benefit from this exceptional opportunity. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
