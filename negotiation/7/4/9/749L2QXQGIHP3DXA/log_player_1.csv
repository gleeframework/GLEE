Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price. What do you say to $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $100. Aiming for a price close to this maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Ensure Profit over Guaranteed Sale:** While selling to John guarantees $80, there's a chance to earn more from Bob."
