"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's something that I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This price gives you a great value and ensures I get a fair price for my product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is under your $12,000 limit, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or get a slightly better deal from John."
