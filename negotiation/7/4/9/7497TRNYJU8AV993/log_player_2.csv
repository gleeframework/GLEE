"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget, giving him room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity.  While I'm interested, I'm going to need to see a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still some room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $860000. This is a very good price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $860,000 is very close to Bob's last offer of $850,000.  It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly lower price.  Accepting the offer saves Bob time and potentially avoids the risk of Alice getting a better offer elsewhere.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small compared to the cost of delaying the purchase or the risk of losing the deal."
