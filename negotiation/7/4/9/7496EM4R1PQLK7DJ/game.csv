"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11200. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about $11500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go up to $11500. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to discuss the shipping costs as well. Can you throw in a discount on shipping if I buy the product at this price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can definitely discuss the shipping costs with you, Bob. However, I'd like to focus on the product price first. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to throw in a small discount on the product itself, not the shipping. How about $11200, and I'll include a free accessory that's worth $200? That way, you'll still get a great deal on the product, and I'll be able to make a bit more on the sale.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10800, and I'd like to get the free accessory as a separate concession. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000. Can you meet me at this price?",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10800. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10900. I'll throw in the free accessory as a separate concession, as you requested. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",10900.0,Alice,9,
