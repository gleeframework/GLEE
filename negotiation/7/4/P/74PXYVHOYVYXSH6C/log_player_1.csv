Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than my minimum acceptable price:**  It's above my floor of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money if Bob accepts.
* **Attractive to Bob:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him a good deal and making him more likely to accept.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a high chance of Bob accepting the offer."
