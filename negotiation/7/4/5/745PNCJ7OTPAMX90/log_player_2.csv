"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good but not great.** You can potentially get a better deal.
* **You want to explore options.**  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** You can always go to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting my counteroffer at $9,000, a reasonable drop from Alice's initial price. This signals my seriousness in negotiating.
* **Room for Compromise:** This price leaves room for Alice to counter, allowing for back-and-forth negotiations.
* **Staying Below My Limit:**  I'm still well under my $10,000 limit, so I have some wiggle room if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer.** Her offer is only $200 higher than my counteroffer, showing she's willing to compromise.
* **I still have room to negotiate.** I can likely get her down a bit more.
* **Staying Below My Limit:**  I'm still comfortable with the $9,700 offer, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Change:** I'm raising my offer by $200, showing I'm willing to compromise but not give in too easily.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer gauges Alice's willingness to budge further. 
* **Still Below My Limit:**  I'm still well within my budget, giving me a comfortable margin if Alice counters again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my limit:**  Alice's offer is only $800 below my maximum budget, and I'm unsure if I can get it lower.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further. 
* **Time is ticking:** With limited rounds remaining, accepting the offer ensures I get the product.

It's a good deal, and the risk of losing it by continuing to negotiate is too high at this point."
