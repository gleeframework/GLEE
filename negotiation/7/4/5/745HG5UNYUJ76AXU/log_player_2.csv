"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  You want to save as much money as possible, and going to the next round gives you that opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  $85 is a reasonable starting point, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, you're still aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even lower price. You can still get a better deal by counteroffering and going for a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $85.  Would you consider $87.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet Alice halfway, but still aims for a price that's closer to your target. 
* **Fairness:**  $87.50 is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, emphasizing that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Closing the Gap:** By offering a slightly higher price, you show that you're serious about making a deal, while still maintaining leverage to potentially negotiate further."
