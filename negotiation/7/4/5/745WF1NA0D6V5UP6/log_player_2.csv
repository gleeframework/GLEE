"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and John is also willing to sell it for $12,000, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting her offer and buying from John achieves the same outcome at the same price."
