{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable for you.  I've set the price at $925,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  To maximize your profit, you want to aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum while still staying attractive to Bob. 

Offering the product at $925,000 creates a win-win scenario:

* **Bob's Win:** Bob gains the product at $75,000 less than his valuation. 
* **Your Win:** You secure a profit of $125,000, significantly more than your guaranteed $800,000 from John. 

This strategy balances ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
