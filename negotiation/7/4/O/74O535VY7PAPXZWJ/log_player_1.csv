{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, allowing him to gain $100,000 in value while still staying below his maximum budget.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, allowing me to potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, given the value you place on the product and my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price point and my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This still allows you a significant gain, and it's a reasonable compromise from my end. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer bridges the gap between our positions while remaining closer to my initial offer. It still provides Bob with a $100,000 profit, and it's more likely to be accepted than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. The risk of continuing negotiations is lower than accepting this offer, as I believe we can still reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down just a little further to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to meet Bob halfway while still securing a price above my minimum acceptable threshold. It offers a reasonable compromise and highlights the benefits for both of us, making it more likely to be accepted."
