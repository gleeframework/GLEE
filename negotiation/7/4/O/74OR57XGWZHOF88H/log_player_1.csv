Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
