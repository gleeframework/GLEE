"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, the value this product brings makes it difficult to accept that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you a significant gain.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your coming down a bit, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $987,500.  This price is a good compromise and allows both of us to get a fair deal.  What do you say?",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your negotiation skills.  While I'm aiming for a slightly higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're firm on $1,000,000, but unfortunately, that's still outside my budget.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering my final price of $975,000.  It's a good price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let's make it happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
