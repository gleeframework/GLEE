"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $12,000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I get to sell it quickly. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
