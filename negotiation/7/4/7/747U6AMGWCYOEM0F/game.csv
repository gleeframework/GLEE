"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $16,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit below my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $13,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to get a fair price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $11,250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
