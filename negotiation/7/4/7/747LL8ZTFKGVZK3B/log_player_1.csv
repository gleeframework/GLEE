"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I think the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what I know it's worth to me. This allows for negotiation and gives me some room to move down if necessary. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. How about we go down to $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price. With only four rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and secure a guaranteed profit than to risk losing out on a better deal."
