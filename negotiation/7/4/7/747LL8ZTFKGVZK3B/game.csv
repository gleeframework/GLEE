"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145? That would be a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. How about we go down to $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer.",125.0,Bob,6,
