Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to accept a price significantly lower than that. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is a significant profit for me and still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I emphasize the value the product holds for him and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While I'm starting high, I'm not setting an unrealistic expectation. This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and reach a compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any).
* **John as a safety net:**  Remember, I have John as a fallback option, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a lower price. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This aligns more closely with my valuation of the product and would allow me to make the purchase within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** While Bob's offer is above my absolute minimum ($800,000), it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price of $950,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely secure a higher price.  
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:**  Selling to John right now would be a safe bet, but I'm willing to risk a little more to potentially get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price between Bob's offer of $850,000 and my initial offer of $950,000.  This shows flexibility but demonstrates that I'm not willing to accept a significantly lower price. 
* **Monitoring John:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or become too unfavorable, I'll switch to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This would still give you a great price and would be fair for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price to $900,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate that the deal is still favorable for Bob, providing him with a good price for a valuable product.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage a successful outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, we've reached a deal. If he rejects, I'll need to consider my next move.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't lead to a mutually acceptable agreement, I'll be ready to secure the sale with John."
