"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me right now. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering the product for $1,350,000. This still leaves room for you to gain a significant benefit, and it's a fair price for the value I'm offering. Let's work together to make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
