"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  That's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer leaves room for negotiation."
