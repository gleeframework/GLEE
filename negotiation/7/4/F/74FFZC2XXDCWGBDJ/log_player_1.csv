Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price. I know Bob values the product at $120, so this is a good starting point for negotiation.  I'll be ready to adjust the price if he counteroffers, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept anything that undervalues the product for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm offering $150, which is my absolute minimum price.  This is a good compromise, as it's higher than Bob's initial offer, but still lower than my initial asking price.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm open to negotiation, $145 is still below my minimum threshold of $150.  At this point, John is offering me a price that meets my requirements, and it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll go ahead and sell the product to John."
