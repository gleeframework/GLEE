"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum valuation. We can try negotiating a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This strategy aims to understand Alice's lower bound while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $70 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice met us halfway, the price is still above our target. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're inching closer to our desired price. By proposing $75, we're signaling our willingness to negotiate but also holding our ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $75 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $82. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is slowly approaching our desired price range. While not ideal, $82 is a reasonable compromise to avoid the risk of the negotiation failing and having to purchase from John at a higher price."
