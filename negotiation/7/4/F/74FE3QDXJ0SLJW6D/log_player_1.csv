"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to establish a baseline for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Does he even consider this price reasonable?
* **Set a high starting point:**  This gives me more leverage in subsequent negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly, but not too much. I'll also assess whether I should continue negotiating with Bob or go with John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.  

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation Power:** I have a strong position because I have a guaranteed backup offer from John. This gives me leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Value Recognition:**  Bob acknowledges the product's value, which is encouraging. He's also willing to negotiate, indicating a potential deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Strategic Approach:** I'll continue to monitor Bob's willingness to negotiate and be ready to shift to John's offer if the negotiations stall."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying close to my desired value.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value, justifying my counteroffer. 
* **Positive Outlook:** I use language like ""walk away happy"" to frame the counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's commitment to the deal. If he's truly interested, he should be willing to meet me halfway.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By staying slightly above my minimum acceptable price, I maintain leverage and can still switch to John's offer if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to make small adjustments to the price if necessary, but I won't compromise too much on my desired profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your need to stay close to your initial price, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I think it's a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that, especially considering I have a guaranteed offer from John. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining Value:**  I need to maintain the value of the product and ensure I get the price it deserves. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I still have the backup offer from John, giving me the ability to walk away if necessary.

* **Assessment:** I'll assess Bob's commitment to the deal and decide whether to continue negotiating or switch to John's offer based on his response."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,525,000?

* **Adaptability:** I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. If he's resistant, I might need to make a more significant concession, but only if I believe it's necessary to secure the deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I think this price is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not securing a deal with John is too high.

**Strategy:**

* **Time Constraint:** The limited rounds remaining mean I need to act decisively.
* **Guaranteed Value:**  John's offer guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirements. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Accepting John's offer minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept John's offer, ensuring a guaranteed sale and a profit that meets my minimum expectations. While I'd prefer to secure a higher price, the circumstances and remaining time make it more strategic to accept John's offer."
