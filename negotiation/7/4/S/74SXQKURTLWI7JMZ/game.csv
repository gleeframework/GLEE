"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. While I value our conversation, $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still allows me to make a profit while offering you a fair price. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,
