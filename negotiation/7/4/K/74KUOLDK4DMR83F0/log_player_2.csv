Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13,500.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. While Alice has come down in price, they are still above Bob's budget. He's reached his limit for negotiation and it's better to secure the product for his desired price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
