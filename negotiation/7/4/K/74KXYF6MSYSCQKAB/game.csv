"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value you mentioned earlier. Can you meet me in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That seems like a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm really hoping to get $11,000 for this product.  It's truly worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that price.  Can we compromise at $10,900? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10900.0,Alice,7,
