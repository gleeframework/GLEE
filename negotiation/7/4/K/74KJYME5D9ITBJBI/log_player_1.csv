Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and meeting at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I still have 9 rounds to do so."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there yet.

Let's keep this conversation going and see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product. Can you reconsider and meet me at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I understand he's trying to meet me halfway, I still need to earn at least $800,000 for this product. It's important for me to remember that I have multiple rounds left and I'm not in a rush to sell.  I'm hoping to convince Bob to increase his offer."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob is finally offering my minimum price, and I have to weigh my options carefully.  I've been holding out for more, but it's been six rounds and I'm not sure if he'll come up any further.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $800,000.  This is my minimum price, and I'm confident I can find another buyer for a higher price in the future."
