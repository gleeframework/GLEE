"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still offers you a substantial profit. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I can't go lower than $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
