"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning the product being ""fantastic""  hints at its value without revealing specifics, making Bob curious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $8,500 is tempting, I can potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **More negotiation room:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially increase the price further. 
* **Gaining information:** Observing Bob's willingness to negotiate gives me valuable insight into his perceived value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is a compromise:** $9,250 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive & encouraging:**  The message maintains a positive tone and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's level of interest and see if he's willing to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:**  While $8,800 is only $200 away from my minimum, there's still a chance to get closer to my target.
* **Negotiation is key:**  By continuing the negotiation, I can potentially convince Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds left, I have time to explore if a higher price is possible.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I can always fall back to John's offer if I don't get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference this time and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Fairness:** The counteroffer of $9,000 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. This emphasizes my willingness to compromise and suggests a fair price for both parties.
* **Focus on Value:** The message subtly implies the value of the product by suggesting a ""fair"" price.
* **Direct & Clear:** The message is direct and avoids unnecessary fluff, focusing on the key point: price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's willingness to meet my price expectations and see if he's ready to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is still on my side:** With 4 rounds left, I still have time to potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** I can always sell to John for $8,000 if I don't get a better offer from Bob.
* **Bob is showing a pattern:** Bob keeps coming back with offers near my minimum, but hasn't reached a point where I'm comfortable accepting.  
* **Potential for a breakthrough:**  By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to convince Bob to go a little higher.

**Next Steps:**  I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my target price, but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to find a solution we both can agree on. I'm willing to go down to $8,900. This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can come to your price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Calling this my ""final offer"" adds pressure and potentially encourages Bob to accept.
* **Close to Minimum:** This offer is only $100 above my minimum, showing flexibility while remaining close to my desired price.
* **Clear & Concise:**  The message is clear and direct, focusing on the offer and leaving no room for ambiguity.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, the message hints at the time constraint, potentially motivating Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think I can do better. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to two rounds left and Bob's offers are getting lower, not higher. 
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** At this point, it's highly unlikely that Bob will offer a price I'm comfortable with.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is far better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price. 
* **Learning Experience:** Even though I didn't get the highest price, I gained valuable experience in negotiation, and I can use this knowledge in future transactions."
