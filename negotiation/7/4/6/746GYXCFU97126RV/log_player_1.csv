Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a price that is higher than what he values the product at, but it is also lower than what I would get from John. This strategy gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while also aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob $140. This is a compromise that is closer to his offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price for Bob and bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, his offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since John is willing to pay $150, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
