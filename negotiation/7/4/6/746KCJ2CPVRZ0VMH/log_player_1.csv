Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

While ideally, I'd like to get $150, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting his offer of $130 is better than risking him walking away and only getting $150 from John."
