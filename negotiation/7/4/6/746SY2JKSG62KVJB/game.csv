"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This price takes into account the value of the product to you and my own profit margin. I believe it's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair to both of us, and it ensures we both can benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I believe this price is still a good compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
