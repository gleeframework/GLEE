Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This will allow some room for negotiation, but it also demonstrates my confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer.  This should encourage Bob to consider a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is too far below my minimum acceptable value.  Since John is willing to buy the product for $100, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
