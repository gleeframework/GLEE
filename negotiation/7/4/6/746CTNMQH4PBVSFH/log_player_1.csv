"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that gives Bob room to negotiate, but still reflects the product's value to me.  If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try to push for a higher price. There are still 9 rounds, and I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if I have to. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer,  showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It also gives me some room to adjust if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still above my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have 6 rounds left, so I can still afford to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to start closing the gap. I'm also getting closer to John's offer, so I have a good fallback option if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I've already rejected his offer twice. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I don't think he'll go higher.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. This will guarantee me a good price and avoids risking further negotiation."
