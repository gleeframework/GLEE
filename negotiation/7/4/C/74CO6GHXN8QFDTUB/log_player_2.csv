"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring the counteroffer option to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($1,100,000) shows Bob is serious about negotiating and sets the stage for potential compromise.  $950,000 is a significant discount from Alice's asking price, and is still within Bob's budget.  This is a strong starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he believes the product is worth. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can drive the price down further.  There are still multiple rounds left, and a counteroffer could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise,  meeting Alice's minimum acceptable price while staying within Bob's budget. It's likely that Alice will accept this offer, as it's just slightly below her minimum price.  If Alice rejects, Bob can then assess whether continuing to negotiate is worth the risk of running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to Bob's desired price of $1,000,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and running out of rounds is high.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget.  It's a safe bet, avoiding the risk of a potentially more expensive deal with John."
