{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range I'm willing to pay. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her asking price. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but also making it clear that I'm prepared to walk away if the price isn't right."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my budget, but closer to my ideal price. It's worth continuing negotiations, as I have a chance to potentially get a better deal, but also have the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price lower than her current offer but believe this is a reasonable step towards a deal.  It also provides room for further negotiation if needed."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal, but I also have the backup option of buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** This is my final offer, which is my maximum budget.  I'm taking a calculated risk here, hoping Alice will accept this price to avoid going to John and potentially losing the sale altogether. If she rejects, I'll buy from John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is still above my maximum budget. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Buying from John at $1,000,000 ensures I get the product within my budget."
