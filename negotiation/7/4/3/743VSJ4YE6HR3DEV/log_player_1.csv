I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still being competitive.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not risking a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  I won't sell for less than my minimum price of $12,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500.  This is still a significant discount from my asking price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise and gives Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I value the product at $12,000 and won't sell for less.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements.  I'll sell to John."
