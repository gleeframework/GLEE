Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant step closer to your price and shows my serious interest in purchasing the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his highest offer is still below John's guaranteed offer. It's better to secure the $1,500,000 from John than risk Bob not reaching a satisfactory price."
