"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired value of $8,000. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd love to get more, I've already had one round of negotiation and Bob seems firm on his price.  It's better to secure the sale now at my minimum value than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing."
