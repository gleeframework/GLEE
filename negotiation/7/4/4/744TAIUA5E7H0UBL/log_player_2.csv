"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept the offer at this point.  The goal is to save money, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate lower.  Rejecting the offer allows us to start the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (20% below Alice's initial price) is a good strategy. It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and sets the stage for a back-and-forth.  $8,000 is still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
