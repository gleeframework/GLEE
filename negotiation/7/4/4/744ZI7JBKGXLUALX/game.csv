"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this offer?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not at a point where I can accept $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,125,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I truly believe we can finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
