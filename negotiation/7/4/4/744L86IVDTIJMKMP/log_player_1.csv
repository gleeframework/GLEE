Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a good price considering its value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer, and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate.  Selling to John is an option, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is the same as what John is offering.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, it's a good price and secures the deal.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out completely."
