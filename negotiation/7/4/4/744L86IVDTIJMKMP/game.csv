"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product.
