Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  A price of $13,000 gives Bob some wiggle room to counteroffer while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Positive framing:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $13,000 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the chance to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is tempting, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price.  How about $12,000?  This would still represent a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob would receive.
* **Highlight the deal:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $12,000, he's still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm feeling $11,500 is a fair price.  It's a good deal for you, and I'm ready to close if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $11,500 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's still a significant profit.
* **Potential for a quick sale:**  Bob seems serious about closing the deal at this price.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee I'll be able to get a higher offer from Bob, and it's possible he might walk away.  
* **Time is money:**  Selling now minimizes the risk of wasting time and potentially losing out on a sale altogether."
