"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. I hope you can understand my position.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
