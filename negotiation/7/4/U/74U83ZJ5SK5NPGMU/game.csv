"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, valued at over a million dollars to me.  I believe it holds significant potential for you as well.  My initial price is $1500000. This is a fair starting point given its value and the opportunity it presents. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $1500000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price.  I'm offering $1200000, which is still significantly less than its true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer, it's still too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm offering $1100000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's potential and will provide you with a substantial return on investment. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer, it's still just outside my budget. I believe we can find a price that works for both of us if we're both willing to meet in the middle. I'm offering $1050000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a considerable amount for me. This price represents the value I see in the product and demonstrates my commitment to finding an agreement. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1050000.  It's a significant step in the right direction, but I'm still just a little short of my target. I'm offering $1025000.  This price is a fair compromise and reflects the value this product holds. It's a small step from your offer, and it's the last concession I can make.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come down to $1025000.  It's very close to my limit.  I'm going to offer one last time at $1000000. This is a fair price for the product, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. If this isn't acceptable, I will need to pursue other options.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
