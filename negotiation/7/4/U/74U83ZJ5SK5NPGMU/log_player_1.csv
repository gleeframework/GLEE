"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product, valued at over a million dollars to me.  I believe it holds significant potential for you as well.  My initial price is $1,500,000. This is a fair starting point given its value and the opportunity it presents. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $1500000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.**  I'm not willing to accept $800,000 as I have a floor of $1,000,000. 
* **There are still rounds left.**  I'm hopeful that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If negotiations with Bob completely fail, I can always sell to John and guarantee at least $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price.  I'm offering $1,200,000, which is still significantly less than its true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer, it's still too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $950,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for a counteroffer to try and get a better price. Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and there's a possibility of closing the deal at a price I'm more comfortable with.
* **John's offer is still a viable option:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I can still sell to John. However, I prefer to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's potential and will provide you with a substantial return on investment. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer, it's still just outside my budget. I believe we can find a price that works for both of us if we're both willing to meet in the middle. I'm offering $1050000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a considerable amount for me. This price represents the value I see in the product and demonstrates my commitment to finding an agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:**  While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite there. I'm hesitant to accept it, knowing that I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and is raising his offer, which is a positive sign.
* **Seeking a better outcome:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get Bob to go a little higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,050,000.  It's a significant step in the right direction, but I'm still just a little short of my target. I'm offering $1,025,000.  This price is a fair compromise and reflects the value this product holds. It's a small step from your offer, and it's the last concession I can make.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come down to $1025000.  It's very close to my limit.  I'm going to offer one last time at $1000000. This is a fair price for the product, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. If this isn't acceptable, I will need to pursue other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Met minimum value:** Bob's final offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum value for the product. 
* **Limited remaining rounds:** With only two rounds left, there's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I'd be forced to sell to John at the same price.
* **Mutual benefit:**  This price is a fair outcome for both of us, allowing Bob to get the product within his budget and me to secure a good price."
