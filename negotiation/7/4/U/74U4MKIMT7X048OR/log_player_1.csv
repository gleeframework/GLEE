Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob's interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is still above my minimum of $80. It's better to secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's offer of $80."
