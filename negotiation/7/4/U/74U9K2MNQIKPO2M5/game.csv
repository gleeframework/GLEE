"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its actual value. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still hoping to land closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to negotiate, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way to $9,250. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
