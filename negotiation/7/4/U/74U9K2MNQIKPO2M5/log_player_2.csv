"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000. It's not worth continuing the negotiation.  It's time to buy from John for $10,000."
