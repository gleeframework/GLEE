"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $95 for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $105. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I've made concessions already, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $105. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that's worth $15. So, the total value you'll get is $120. I'm not budging from this price, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the extra accessory, but I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Could you consider $98 for the product?",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already included an extra accessory worth $15, and I'm still not willing to go below $105. I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, so I'll try one last time. I'll throw in another small concession: I'll give you a 5% discount on the product price. So, the price would be $99.50. This is my final offer, Bob. What do you think?",99.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I appreciate your efforts. I am willing to pay $97 for the product if you could possibly meet me there.",97.0,Bob,10,
