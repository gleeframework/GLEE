"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you consider $700,000? That would make this a very attractive deal for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
