"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $175. Would you be willing to consider that?",175.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $150?",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already considered selling to John for $150, and I'd rather not do that. I'm willing to meet you at $165. It's my final offer, so if you're interested, now's the time to make a decision.",165.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to lose patience, Bob. I've already considered selling to John, but I'm willing to give you one last chance. I'll meet you at $160, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'm moving on.",160.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than $160, and you've already rejected that offer. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm going to make one final offer: $162. If you're not interested, I'm selling to John.",162.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're trying to sell the product, but I'm not willing to go above $155. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to pay $155 for the product.",155.0,Bob,10,
