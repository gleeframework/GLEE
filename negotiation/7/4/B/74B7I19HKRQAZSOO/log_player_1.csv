I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $115.  This is still above what Bob offered, but it's a step closer to his value and might be more tempting than selling to John."
