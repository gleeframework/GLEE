This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm serious about selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one, keeping in mind my minimum value and Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you while staying within my acceptable range.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to it."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1125000. I believe this price is fair for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is close enough to my minimum of $1,500,000 to be acceptable. While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and a potential lower offer from Bob is too high.  I would rather secure the sale now and avoid the uncertainty."
