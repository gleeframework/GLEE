Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,125,000. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product.

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm worried we're going back and forth too much.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee a sale."
