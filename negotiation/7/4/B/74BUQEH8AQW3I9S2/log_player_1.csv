Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters. However, I'm aware that if he rejects, I can still sell to John for $100, so I don't want to be too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm going to reject it. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm proposing a price of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and the value to Bob. This offers a compromise and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
