``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me. This allows for room for negotiation and hopefully leads to a good price for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 is still a little too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle on $8,200? That way we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,600?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of time, and Bob is not budging much. While $7,600 is close to my minimum, it's still below it.  I'd rather sell to John for $8,000 and get a guaranteed deal at my minimum acceptable price."
