"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  Let me know if you're interested.",11250.0,Alice,3,
