Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to try and build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price ($15,000), as I want to give Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer at my minimum price, so I don't have to accept anything lower than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also not that far off from Bob's initial perceived value of $8,000, so there's not much room for him to increase his offer.
* **Opportunity to Counter:** I have a backup buyer in John, so I can afford to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  A counteroffer gives me the chance to increase the price without risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial value. This shows willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my own desired price point. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob, reminding him that the price is still beneficial to him.
* **Leaving Space for Final Agreement:**  By offering $11,250, I'm leaving some room for potential further negotiation if Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly. 
* **Maintaining Backup:** I still have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not in a rush to accept any offer below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer is Too Low:** $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Even though I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop that much.
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, so any counteroffer from my side is likely to be rejected.
* **Secure Option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price. This is a safer and more profitable option than risking further negotiation with Bob."
