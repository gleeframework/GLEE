Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1,100,000?  This is still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to stay close to your asking price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,000,000 is still significantly better than selling to John for $800,000."
