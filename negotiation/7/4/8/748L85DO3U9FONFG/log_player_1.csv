Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  He'll see it as a good deal for himself.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum profit.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** It sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

This strategy aims to secure a deal quickly while ensuring you get a decent profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, you can then analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me. While his offer is above his valuation, it's not a deal that benefits me.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. This will allow me to gauge his true willingness to pay and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is above Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a loss to myself.
* **Counter-offer is still below my minimum:** This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Message is positive and encouraging:** It maintains a constructive tone, emphasizing a desire for a mutually beneficial deal.

By offering $1,050,000, I'm trying to find a middle ground, demonstrating flexibility while still protecting my interests. This counteroffer will allow me to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it doesn't significantly bridge the gap. 

Continuing to negotiate with Bob has potential, but I'm wary of getting bogged down in a lengthy process with a buyer who seems unwilling to meet my minimum.  

I will make a final counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move forward with selling to John, who is offering a price that meets my minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to reach a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  I'll offer you the product for $1,012,500. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to go this high, I'll have to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  This is my last attempt to negotiate with Bob.
* **Meeting Halfway:** By offering $1,012,500, I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's offer of $975,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit. 
* **Clear Deadline:** The message emphasizes this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or move on.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning the availability of another buyer (John)  is a subtle way to reinforce that I have other options.

This counteroffer aims to achieve a deal with Bob while remaining within my acceptable price range.  If he rejects it, I will proceed with selling to John."
