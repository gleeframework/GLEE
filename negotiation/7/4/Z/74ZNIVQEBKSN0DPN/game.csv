"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $600000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $800000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit below the true value of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $900000. This is a final offer on my end.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
