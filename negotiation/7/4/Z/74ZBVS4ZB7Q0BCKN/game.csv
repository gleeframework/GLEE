"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000, and I'm willing to make a significant investment in it.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $900000 is the highest I can go. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal. Can we meet at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $900000. I've already compromised a lot by offering you $950000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",975000.0,Alice,7,
