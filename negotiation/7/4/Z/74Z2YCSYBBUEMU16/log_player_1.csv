{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's in excellent condition and a great value for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and still potentially earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I am confident I can get closer to my desired value. I'll try to negotiate with him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I believe I can push for a bit more and get closer to my target.  I'll see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's getting closer to what I need.  To be honest, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800, as a final offer. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and my previous offer of $10,500. How about $10,650? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, and while it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $12,000. It's also possible that rejecting his offer could lead to further negotiation, but that may take time and I'm not sure if we can reach a higher price. It's better to secure the deal now and get the product off my hands."
