It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $1,050,000 is a good deal considering your maximum budget is $1,200,000. It's better to secure the product now at a good price rather than risking further negotiation or going to John."
