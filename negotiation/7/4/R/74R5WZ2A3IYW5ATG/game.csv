"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your perspective. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer, but I can't go as low as $950,000.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still being mindful of your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
