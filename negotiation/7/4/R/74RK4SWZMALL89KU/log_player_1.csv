Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening offer, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm confident I can get a price that is profitable. I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want a price that reflects the value of the product. Hopefully, this will be a sweet spot that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $920,000 is a good deal and still above the value I placed on the product.  Further negotiation might get me a bit more, but it's also a risk that could lead to Bob walking away and me having to sell to John for less.  Accepting the offer minimizes risk and ensures a good profit."
