"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this excellent product. Given its immense value, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""immense value"" sets the stage for a high-priced item.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Assuring Bob you want a price that ""works for both of us"" implies you're willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Set a high initial reference point, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe how Bob reacts to determine how aggressively to proceed in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, so I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below your minimum acceptable price. While he claims it's his maximum budget, there's likely room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  Continue emphasizing the product's worth to justify a higher price.
* **Explore Alternatives:**  By rejecting, you signal you have other options (selling to John), potentially motivating Bob to increase his offer. 

You'll need to significantly reduce your asking price in the next round to show flexibility but avoid dropping below your $1,500,000 threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer stands as a testament to my desire to make this deal work."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:**  Dropping by $400,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Threshold:** The new price remains well above your $1,500,000 minimum and provides room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value justifies the still-high price.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""this offer stands"" subtly implies a limited-time opportunity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to consider that, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $800,000, which is far too low. However, his statement about exploring other options suggests he's somewhat invested in the deal. By rejecting again:

* **Call His Bluff:** Bob might just be using this tactic to try and get you to lowball yourself.  Rejecting might push him to reveal his true willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Strong Position:** Accepting his offer now would set a bad precedent and make it difficult to negotiate higher.

It's risky to continue rejecting, but with six rounds remaining and a guaranteed offer from John, there's still room to maneuver.  Your next counteroffer should be a smaller reduction to test Bob's resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand this product's value is significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This time, you're reducing your price by $200,000 instead of $400,000. This shows Bob you're negotiating but not desperate. 
* **Firm Language:** Phrases like ""absolute limit"" and ""fair compromise"" convey seriousness and a reluctance to move much further.
* **Direct Question:** Ending with ""What do you say?"" prompts Bob for a response and hopefully encourages him to counter-propose. 

You're nearing a critical point. If Bob doesn't budge, you'll need to decide how long you're willing to push for a higher price before accepting John's offer."
