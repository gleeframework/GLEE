{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, so I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer stands as a testament to my desire to make this deal work.

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my budget, I'm not willing to go above $800,000.  It's time to counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to consider that, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand this product's value is significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Alice is still unwilling to budge on her price, and it's clear this negotiation isn't going anywhere. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
