Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also reflects the true worth of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and since I have another buyer ready to pay the same amount, there's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
