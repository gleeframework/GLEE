Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make the price seem more attractive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's close enough to my minimum value ($15,000). 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer, attempting to get closer to my desired price.
* If the negotiations stall, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a better price through further counteroffers.
* **Risk of Losing John:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on the opportunity to sell to John for $15,000, which is my desired outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum value, hoping to reach a compromise that is more beneficial to me. 
* If Bob continues to offer prices below my minimum, I will consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but unfortunately, $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob to make the price more appealing.
* **Direct Approach:**  I'm stating my minimum price upfront to avoid going back and forth with multiple counteroffers.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If his counteroffer is still below my minimum, I'll either make another counteroffer or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I've considered it, but I'm still unable to go above $10,000 for the product. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeatedly refused to go above $10,000, and it's clear further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price closer to my minimum.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  I'm risking losing a guaranteed $15,000 from John by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, selling to John is the best option to avoid selling below my minimum and losing out on a more lucrative deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale for $15,000."
