Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in a negotiation. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, I can always come down in price.
* **Backup Option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so I'm not losing money if Bob declines.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
