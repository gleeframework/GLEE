"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $18,000.  This is significantly higher than Bob's target price. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $15,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $12,000. It makes sense to continue negotiating and see if a better deal can be reached."
