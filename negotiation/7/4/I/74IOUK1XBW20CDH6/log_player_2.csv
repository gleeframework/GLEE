Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can likely still get it for less.  He's made a significant concession in the last round, but Alice hasn't moved as much. It's worth seeing if he can get her to come down further."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than her previous offer, it's still higher than his target price and he's already indicated a willingness to pay more than $8,875.
