"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $8,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I think it's a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $9,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. That's a significant move from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $8,875, but I'm really not comfortable going any higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.",8875.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, which is my best and final offer on this price. If we can't meet here, I'm open to exploring other options. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go up to $8,950, but I'm truly at my limit.  We're both close to a deal, and I believe this price is fair considering our previous discussions.  Let's make this happen.",8950.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $8,950. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,9,
