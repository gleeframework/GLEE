Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **My Minimum:** I need at least $10,000 for the product.
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay $10,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  By offering $11,500, I'm aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (closer to his value) while still giving me a profit significantly higher than my minimum and John's offer. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of selling to Bob while still securing a good profit."
