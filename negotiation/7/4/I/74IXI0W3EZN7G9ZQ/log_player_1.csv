Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Opening:** A starting price of $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters but still ensures a good profit.
* **Clear Expectations:** The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach emphasizes the value you place on the product and can potentially lead to a quicker sale.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, you automatically sell to John at $12,000."
