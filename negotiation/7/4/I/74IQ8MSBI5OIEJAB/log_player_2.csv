"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9000. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a great deal on something that's really valuable to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob a chance to either counter-offer Alice or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
