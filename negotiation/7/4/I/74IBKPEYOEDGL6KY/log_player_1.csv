Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't afford that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is my maximum offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
