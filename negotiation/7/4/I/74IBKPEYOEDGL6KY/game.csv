"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't afford that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is my maximum offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This takes into account the value it brings while recognizing your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be frank, selling for anything less than $1,500,000 is a significant loss for me. However, I value our developing relationship and want to see this deal through. My final offer is $1,600,000. This is the lowest I can go.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
