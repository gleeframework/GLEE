"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd like to offer $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's closer to my target of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is closer to my target price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground again, but this time I'm only offering $5 less than Alice's offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but still want to get a good deal."
