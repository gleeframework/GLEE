Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($18,000 vs. $12,000), we aim to create a negotiation space. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for a potential counter-offer.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and existing interest, subtly suggesting that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The phrasing ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially negotiate a price closer to his perceived value while still remaining profitable for you.

**Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John for your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

**Best Case:** Bob accepts the offer, or a negotiated price closer to $18,000, netting you a higher profit than selling to John."
