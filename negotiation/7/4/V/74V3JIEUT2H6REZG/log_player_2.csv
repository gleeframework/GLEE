"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. It's still a great deal, if I do say so myself!

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with.  Let's counter again and see if we can close the gap."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your target, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $725,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it!

This seems like a fair compromise. We're saving a significant amount compared to John's offer, and Alice seems firm on her price.  Let's accept and close the deal."
