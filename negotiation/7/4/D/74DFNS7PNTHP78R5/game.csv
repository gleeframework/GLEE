"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still more than I can comfortably afford right now. Let's try $11,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my target.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is a bit better, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that this product is worth more to you than you're letting on...",13000.0,Alice,5,
