"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you a little closer to the middle at $8,750. This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $9,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800. It's a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer.  What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $9,100. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price.",9100.0,Alice,7,
