"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or simply proceed to buy from John at a lower cost."
