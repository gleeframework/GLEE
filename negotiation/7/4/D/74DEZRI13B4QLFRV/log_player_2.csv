"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you, and it's well below the value of $120.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your value, it's still higher than her own value. You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's no reason to accept the first offer when you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $90?  I'm still interested in your product and think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
