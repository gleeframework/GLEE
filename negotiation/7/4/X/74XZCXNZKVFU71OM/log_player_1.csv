I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my goal than John's offer. It's also possible that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away from the deal altogether, and I'd be stuck with John's offer."
