"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for it. That's the maximum I can afford.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, however,  $800,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. I value your interest, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's more than fair.  Let me know your decision.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
