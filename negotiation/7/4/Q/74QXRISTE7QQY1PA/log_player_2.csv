"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is far too high for me. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

You still have a better deal with John and should continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here.  Let's meet in the middle - $937,500. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still respecting the inherent value of what I'm selling. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to your price, but it's still over your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, but you are still better off with John's offer if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $937,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $912,500. This is a significant investment for me and represents the highest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to close it as much as you do.  My final offer is $925,000. This is a firm offer, reflecting the absolute lowest price I can accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but it's still over your ideal budget, and you only have a few rounds left.  While you could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  At this point, it's best to secure the product at a reasonable price with John."
