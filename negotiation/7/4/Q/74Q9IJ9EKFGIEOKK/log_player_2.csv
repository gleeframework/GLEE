{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* Bob knows Alice's minimum price is $8,000, so offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point.
* This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $9,700 is higher than her initial offer of $9,500. This suggests she is not willing to lower her price significantly.
* However, this offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. 
* Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. 
* Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to make another counteroffer."

* This offer represents a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* It's still below Alice's latest offer, and is closer to Bob's maximum price.
