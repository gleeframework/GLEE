Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not comfortable with it.  It's better to stick to my maximum budget of $10,000 and buy the product from John. This ensures I get the best possible deal without risking further negotiation."
