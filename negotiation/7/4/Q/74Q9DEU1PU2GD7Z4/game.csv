"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit higher than you're comfortable with. However, I still think the product is worth more than $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $130 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us and it would help me stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $132.50. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
