Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows her product's worth and John guarantees a $1,500,000 sale. Starting high ($1,400,000) leaves room for negotiation while staying above Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic positioning:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to subtly nudge Bob towards a higher perceived value.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation process.

This strategy aims to maximize profit with Bob while having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
