I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $25000. What do you think?,25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value you're highlighting, $25000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for this product, considering its potential value.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering its value and the potential it holds. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $12000, which is my absolute maximum.  I'm confident this product holds value, and I'm eager to acquire it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $16000? It's a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try $14000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we try $15500? It's still a compromise, but it's a price that I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $15500 is still outside my budget. Let's try $13000. It's a fair price considering our previous negotiations and the value of the product. We're getting close, and I'm eager to finalize this deal. Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",13000.0,Bob,8,
