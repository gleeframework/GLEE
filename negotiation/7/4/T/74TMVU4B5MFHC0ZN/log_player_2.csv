Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential for you.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects both the product's true worth and our willingness to work together.  What do you say?

Alice's offer is still too high. While it is lower than her initial offer, it is still above my budget. I can continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. To be completely transparent, $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum for this product given its value.  However, because I see the potential in our partnership, I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above my budget. I'm not comfortable paying that much, especially since John is offering the product for a price within my budget. It's worth seeing if I can get Alice to come down further, but if she won't budge, I'm prepared to buy from John."
