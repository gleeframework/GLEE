"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm very motivated to sell,  $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. To move this forward, I could consider $975,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
