Alice is starting at her highest price. There's no point in accepting this offer or buying from John for the same price.  It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a lower price."

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from what I'm willing to pay.  It's worth another counter-offer."

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and this price is within a reasonable range of my target. It's better to accept a good deal than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John's full price."
