Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts. Here's why:

* **For you:** You are still earning a decent profit ($1,500) over your minimum acceptable price. 
* **For Bob:** He gets the product for $500 less than its worth to him, making it a good deal. 

By offering a price slightly lower than the product's worth to Bob, you increase the chances of him accepting while still securing a good deal for yourself."
