"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that goes beyond your immediate use. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not able to go that high.  $1,500,000 is my absolute maximum.  This would leave us both with a good deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
