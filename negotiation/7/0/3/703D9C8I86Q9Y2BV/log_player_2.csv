"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that goes beyond your immediate use. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

Alice's offer is still too high. I can still try to negotiate a better price, and if not, I can always buy from John."
