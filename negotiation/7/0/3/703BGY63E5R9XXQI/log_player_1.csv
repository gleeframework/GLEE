"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to begin negotiations with a strong offer that reflects the product's high value to you. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While we want to maximize profit, starting at your absolute minimum ($1,200,000) could immediately alienate Bob. $1,100,000 is a significant but potentially palatable markup over his perceived value.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still considerably lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial difference between his offer and yours, indicating room for negotiation in subsequent rounds.
* **Alternative Option:** The presence of John, who's willing to pay your desired price, gives you leverage and the confidence to decline Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique benefits and potential."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We're making a counteroffer of $1,050,000, a $50,000 concession from our previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing the product's value.
* **Justify the Price:** We're reiterating the ""unique benefits and potential"" of the product to reinforce its value in Bob's mind and justify the higher price point.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're not dropping our price too drastically too soon. Remember, we have the option of selling to John for our desired price, giving us leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Expectations:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now within a reasonable range of your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Strong Profit:** Accepting this offer still provides you with a significant profit of $200,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiations stalling. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
