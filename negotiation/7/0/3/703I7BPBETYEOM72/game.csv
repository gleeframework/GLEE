"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I think it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $115. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. How about we meet at $112? It's a small compromise, but I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",112.0,Alice,5,
