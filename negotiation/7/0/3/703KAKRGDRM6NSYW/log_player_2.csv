"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $140.**  This is better than buying from John for $150.
* **You value the product at $150.** So, even at $140, you're getting a good deal. 
* **Alice values the product at $120.** This means she is still making a profit, even at the lower price. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision to save money and still get the product."
