Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't agree to $1,300,000.  To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 and I might as well go with another seller. If you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob has indicated that $1,100,000 is his upper limit.  Accepting this offer secures a significant profit ($100,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's always possible he might have gone higher, but there's also the chance the deal falls through entirely if I push further."
