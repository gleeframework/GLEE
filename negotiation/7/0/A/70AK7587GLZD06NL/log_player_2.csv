"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand you may not know the full potential of this product yet, but I assure you, it's worth far more than what I'm asking. My price is $1500000.  This is a chance to acquire something truly special.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. You're not getting a discount.
* John is willing to sell for the same price.
* There's no advantage to buying from Alice. You're indifferent between the two options.

Since you are indifferent, it's best to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
