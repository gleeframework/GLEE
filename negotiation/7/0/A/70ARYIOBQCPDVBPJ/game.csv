"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  Let's make this work.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 still doesn't cover my costs.  Let's aim for a figure that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue operating while still offering you a valuable product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
