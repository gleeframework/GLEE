"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800,000. However, I still believe the product's value is closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",950000.0,Alice,5,
