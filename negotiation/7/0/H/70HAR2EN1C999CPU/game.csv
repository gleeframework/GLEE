"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me as a buyer.  However, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to your target, Bob! I'm willing to go up to $112.50. That's as high as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",112.5,Alice,5,
