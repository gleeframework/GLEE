"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be totally transparent, I have a budget in mind that I need to stick to. I could make a move up to $900,000.  Would that work for you?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to move up to $900,000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget to $950,000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
