Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still a significant profit.
* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,450,000 is a strong offer that reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for Bob to see it as a potential gain.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly if he's interested."
