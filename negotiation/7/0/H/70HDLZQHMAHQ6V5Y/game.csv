"Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This remarkable item holds immense value to me, but I understand its true worth lies in its utility and potential impact on your endeavors. Given its significance, I believe it's only fair to extend this offer to someone who appreciates its true value.

Considering the product's worth to you stands at $1,500,000, I propose a purchase price of $1,200,000. This represents a substantial return for me while still allowing you to benefit from its full potential without overextending your budget. I am confident that together, we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations, and we can proceed to finalize the details. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of working with you.

Best regards,
Alice",1200000.0,Alice,1,
