``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is no longer meaningfully negotiating. She went up in price after your last counter offer. At this point, her unwillingness to budge suggests you might not reach a significantly better deal. Buying from John for $15,000, while not ideal, sets a clear limit on your spending and avoids further haggling with Alice."
