"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This price is a starting point, allowing for potential negotiation. It's higher than my minimum value of $10,000, leaving room to compromise.
* **""Great deal"" and ""value"":** These phrases are designed to subtly imply the product's worth without revealing my minimum price.  
* **""Let me know what you think"":**  This encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for closer to $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **""Good starting point"":** This acknowledges Bob's offer while implying that it's not quite high enough.
* **""Looking for closer to"":** This clearly states my desired price range without revealing my absolute minimum.
* **""Meet in the middle"":** This suggests a compromise and makes the offer seem reasonable. 
* **$13,500:** This price is a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to my goal while remaining open to further compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $13000, as I initially suggested? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. While I'd prefer a higher price, considering Bob's persistence and the risk of him backing out entirely, it's wiser to accept his offer of $13,000. 

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:**  We're already in Round 4, and I have limited rounds to secure a deal.
* **No clear advantage in continuing:**  Bob has shown willingness to compromise, but further negotiation may not yield significantly more money. 
* **Security of a sale:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale, whereas continuing could lead to no deal at all, forcing me to sell to John for a lower price.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired price, accepting $13,000 ensures I don't lose out on the opportunity to sell to Bob."
