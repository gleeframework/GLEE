"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we settle on $1,000,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it brings.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While the product is valuable, I need to stay within a certain budget. Could we try $900,000? I feel that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's worth and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $925,000? I'm hoping we can find an agreement soon.",925000.0,Bob,6,
