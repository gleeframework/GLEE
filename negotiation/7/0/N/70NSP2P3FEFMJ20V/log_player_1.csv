Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While the product is valuable, I need to stay within a certain budget. Could we try $900,000? I feel that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's worth and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $925,000? I'm hoping we can find an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $925,000 provides a substantial profit and avoids the risk of continued negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome or losing the sale altogether."
