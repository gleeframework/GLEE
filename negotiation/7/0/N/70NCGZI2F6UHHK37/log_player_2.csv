Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us. My initial offer is $1400000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1325000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I want to try to push for a price closer to my initial counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate to close the deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,325,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. While $1300000 is closer to my desired price, I'm willing to come down just a bit further. How about $1312500?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both close this deal successfully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and the offer is now within a reasonable range.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become too stubborn and the deal will fall apart.  Accepting this offer allows me to get the product at a decent price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation.  There's always a chance that I might get a slightly better price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether isn't worth it."
