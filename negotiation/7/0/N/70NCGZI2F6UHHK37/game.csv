"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1400000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1250000.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1325000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1300000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. While $1300000 is closer to my desired price, I'm willing to come down just a bit further. How about $1312500?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both close this deal successfully.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
