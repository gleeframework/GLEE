Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,300,000. This offer won't last long, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High but Negotiable:**  Starting with a price like $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency (""This offer won't last long"") might encourage Bob to accept quickly without overthinking.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed backup at your desired price gives you a strong position. You don't need to desperately negotiate with Bob."
