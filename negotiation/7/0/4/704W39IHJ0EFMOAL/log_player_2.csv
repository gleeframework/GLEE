"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it's a steal at this price considering its quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob is looking to buy the product for no more than $120. Alice's offer of $180 is far too high. Bob should reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high. I'm only willing to pay $120 for this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $180 is my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still looking for a price closer to $120. While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still too high. Bob should continue negotiating and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $150 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $135. This is my final offer, let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
