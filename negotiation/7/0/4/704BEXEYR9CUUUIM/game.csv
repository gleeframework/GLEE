"Hi Alice, $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me. How about $78? I'm sure we can reach a good price that works for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $78 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle again -  $80.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
