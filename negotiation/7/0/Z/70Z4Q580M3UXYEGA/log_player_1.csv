Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $8,000, which I think is a fair price considering the market value. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for that low of a price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  We're running out of time, and I'm not convinced Bob will come up to a price that meets my minimum value.  Selling to John ensures I get a fair price and don't risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
