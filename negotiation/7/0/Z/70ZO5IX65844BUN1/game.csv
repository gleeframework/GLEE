"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's still a great price for a product worth $100 to you.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference at $80. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
