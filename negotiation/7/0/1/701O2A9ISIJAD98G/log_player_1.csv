Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush to settle for his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you, and this price reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $825,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $800,000. It's also a significant step up from his offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give in too easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that $825000 is a good price for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'm confident that I can convince Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm offering $800,000, which is Bob's perceived value of the product. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a profit for myself. The message emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to see the deal as a good investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $800000. How about we meet at $785000? I'm willing to make a significant investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While I'm close to a deal with Bob, the negotiations have taken longer than I anticipated, and I only have four rounds left.  There's no guarantee that I can reach an agreement with Bob, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
