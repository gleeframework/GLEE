"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's significantly more than your $8,000 maximum and even more than Alice values it. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can proceed to buy from John at your target price."
