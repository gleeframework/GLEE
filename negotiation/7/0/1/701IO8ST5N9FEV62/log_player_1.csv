Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower, opening with a price above your minimum ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""unique value"") to justify the high price and create a sense of scarcity (""limited-time offer"") to encourage a quick decision. 
* **Alternative:**  Having a guaranteed sale with John at $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out.

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profit but acknowledges the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  Observing Bob's reaction to this initial offer can guide further negotiation tactics."
