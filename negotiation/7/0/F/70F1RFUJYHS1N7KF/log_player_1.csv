Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, your goal is to maximize profit. Bob is willing to pay a substantial amount, so aiming high initially is beneficial.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above his perceived value. 
* **Confident Tone:** A confident tone in your message subtly implies the product's value and your willingness to walk away if the offer isn't met.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price slightly lower, but remember your bottom line is $1,500,000."
