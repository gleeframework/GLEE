"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $825,000. It's a fair compromise, and a significant amount less than my initial offer.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
