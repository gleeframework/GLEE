"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price, and I'm willing to move a bit. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $825,000. It's a fair compromise, and a significant amount less than my initial offer.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing your side, but I need the price to work for me too.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $780,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $780,000 is close to my minimum, but it's still below it. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if I can get Bob to go any higher. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John and avoid risking a further decrease in price."
