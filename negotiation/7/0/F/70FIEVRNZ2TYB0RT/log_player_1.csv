Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Higher than my minimum:** $9,500 is well above my minimum of $8,000, which is important for me to make a good profit.
* **Attractive to Bob:** $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000.
* **Reduces risk of rejection:** Offering a price closer to his valuation makes it more likely that Bob will accept, reducing the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
