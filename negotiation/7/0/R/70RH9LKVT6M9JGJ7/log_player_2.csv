"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential benefits, I'm offering it to you for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price, reflecting its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $13,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still too close to it. You want to save as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds, and you haven't even started negotiating. There's room to bring the price down further. 

By rejecting the offer, you can start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, reflecting the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unrealistic:**  A $3,000 drop is significant, but it's still above Alice's estimated value of $8,000. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and emphasizes a willingness to find a middle ground. This helps keep the negotiation open and avoids making Alice feel like she's being pressured.
* **Building leverage:** By making a lower counteroffer, you are demonstrating your bargaining power and setting the stage for a potential compromise in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $11,500 is closer to your desired price, but it's still above the middle ground you proposed in the previous round.
* **Negotiation room:**  You have 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  There's still room to lower the price further. 

By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're determined to get a better deal and keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $10,500. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while also reflecting my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental decrease:** A $1,000 drop from your last offer is a reasonable step, showing that you are willing to compromise.
* **Reinforcing compromise:**  The message uses language like ""fair compromise"" and ""acknowledges the product's worth"" to highlight that your offer is a reasonable midpoint.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  By making another counteroffer, you continue to demonstrate your resolve to get a better deal.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while also making a clear statement that you're not willing to accept the current price."
