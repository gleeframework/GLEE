Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This reflects its value to me and provides a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm better off countering in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, and this offer is a good profit above my baseline. It's better to accept and close the deal now."
