Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $300,000.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value. A price too close to $1,200,000 might offend him and make him question the product's worth.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its potential value and your specific needs, I'm proposing a price of $1,380,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1380000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,380,000 gives Bob a $120,000 discount, a significant incentive to buy. This price also nets you a $180,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""fairness,"" you're subtly anchoring the price as reasonable.

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
