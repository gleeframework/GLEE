Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to try and get a better price from him before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one - would $725,000 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make. I'm going to see if I can push him a little higher before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $725,000 just isn't enough for me. Let's try $800,000 - that's still a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
