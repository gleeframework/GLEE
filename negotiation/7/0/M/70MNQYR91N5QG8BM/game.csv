"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one - would $725,000 work for you?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $725,000 just isn't enough for me. Let's try $800,000 - that's still a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
