"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $850000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. How about we split the difference and settle on $900000? This price still allows you a good deal, and it's closer to my valuation. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we settle on $890000? That's just a small step closer to my target price and I believe it's a fair compromise, considering we're both getting closer to a deal. Let me know if that works for you.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $875000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000. This is my final offer.",875000.0,Bob,6,
