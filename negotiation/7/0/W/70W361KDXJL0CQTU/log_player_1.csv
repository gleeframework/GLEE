{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $14,999. I know it's valuable to you and this is a great opportunity to own it."", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value.  Bob is getting a ""deal"" compared to your alternative.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this initial offer leaves a tiny bit of space for Bob to counter-offer if he's very eager.  You can then decide if a slightly lower price is still acceptable. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's true willingness to pay.  In real-world scenarios, additional information about the buyer can significantly impact your negotiation tactics."
