"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  My message highlights the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price to give myself space to negotiate. 

**Note:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000. This offer to Bob is a starting point, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiations. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, taking into account his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a fair starting point, I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work for me.  This still represents a great value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not by much, indicating I'm serious about a deal but won't settle for a low price.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the worth in a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  ""Let's see if we can find common ground"" keeps the door open for further negotiation.

**Note:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a potential fallback if this negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. How about $10,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  While $10,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  
* **John's Offer is a Strong Option:**  Selling to John guarantees me a much better deal.  
* **Potential for a Better Counteroffer:**  I believe I can push Bob a little further. 

**Next Round:** I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still well above Bob's current offer. I want to see if Bob is truly serious about closing a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000. Let's split the difference. How about $10,500?  That would be a fair compromise, and it's still a great value for you compared to the product's worth. Let me know if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's price, I'm still not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Closing:**  ""Let me know if we can reach an agreement"" signals that I'm ready to close the deal, but I'm not going to give in easily.

**Note:** I'm aware of the time constraint, but I'm also determined to get as close to my desired price as possible. John's offer remains a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $10,250. That's the highest I'm willing to go, so let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, there's not much room for further negotiation.
* **Close to Minimum:** While $10,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Risk of a Stalemate:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks ending in a stalemate, leading to a worse outcome. 

**Conclusion:**  It's time to take the secure option and sell to John."
