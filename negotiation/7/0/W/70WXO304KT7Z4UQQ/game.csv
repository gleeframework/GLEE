"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $10500 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but no lower. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,6,
