Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more if he deems it valuable enough. 
* **Below John's Offer:** By offering it to Bob for $19,000, you're still leaving a margin between your asking price and John's guaranteed offer of $15,000.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but make sure you don't go below your minimum of $15,000."
