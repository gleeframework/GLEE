"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my original offer of $85. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
