Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $20,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product but would need a significantly lower price to make it work.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
