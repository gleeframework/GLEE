# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise at $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value the product brings. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  While he could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice isn't willing to go much lower.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product within his budget."
