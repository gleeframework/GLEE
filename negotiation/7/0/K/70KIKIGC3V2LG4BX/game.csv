"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, which I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11,750 is the best price for this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
