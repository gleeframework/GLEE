Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $10,000 offer leaves room for counteroffers and potential compromise. 
* **Protecting My Interests:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Possible Compromise:**  By rejecting, I open the door for a counteroffer from Bob, potentially closer to my target price. 
* **Protecting My Options:**  If the negotiation stalls, I can still sell to John for my desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is the lowest I can go.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for Agreement:**  $9,500 is still above Bob's offer, leaving room for a possible deal. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still protecting my interests and showing I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. Can you consider $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $9,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Possible Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids further negotiation.
* **Time Efficiency:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and uncertain.  
* **Avoiding Risk:** While I could potentially get a higher price, there's also a risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
