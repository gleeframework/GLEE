"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me there?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is close, but to be honest, I have a standing offer for $12,000 from another buyer. If you're able to meet that price, I'm happy to finalize the deal with you today.  It's a fantastic product and I'd rather it go to you if possible.",12000.0,Alice,5,
