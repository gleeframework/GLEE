"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable starting point. How about we try something closer to market value?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value justifies a premium price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this price reflects the product's true value and will bring you a great return on investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $725,000? That's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My revised offer is $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and potential return on investment.",900000.0,Alice,5,
