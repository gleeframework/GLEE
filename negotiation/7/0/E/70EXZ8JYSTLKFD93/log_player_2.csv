Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value justifies a premium price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this price reflects the product's true value and will bring you a great return on investment.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $725,000? That's a fair offer."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $725,000 is a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My revised offer is $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice is not budging much and is still well above your maximum price. It's unlikely she'll come down to $800,000 in the remaining rounds.  You're better off securing the product from John at your target price."
