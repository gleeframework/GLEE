"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to find a mutually agreeable price. Let's meet halfway on this.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
