{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I clearly state my willingness to discuss the price further, indicating I'm not inflexible. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, allowing me to walk away if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,200,000 I can get from John.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. The gap between his offer and my minimum is still significant enough to make further negotiations worthwhile.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on Bob and shows I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to find a mutually agreeable price. Let's meet halfway on this."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to reason:** Emphasizing ""value"" and ""mutually agreeable"" aims to appeal to Bob's rationality.
* **Clear next step:**  I'm explicitly suggesting a meeting in the middle to push the negotiation towards a successful conclusion."

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Small gap:** The difference between his offer and my minimum is now smaller, making further negotiation potentially fruitful.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer maintains the pressure on Bob.  It shows I'm not desperate and encourages him to increase his offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll make one last attempt at a compromise. My counteroffer is $1,075,000 for your product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost there, but not enough:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,200,000 I can get from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a prolonged process and potentially lower my final price.
* **Securing the better deal:** Selling to John guarantees the highest price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
