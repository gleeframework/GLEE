Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your ""walkaway"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to be creative.

**The Strategy**

Since a direct sale within Bob's valuation is impossible, you need to either:

1. **Increase Bob's Perceived Value:** Convince Bob the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to him. This is difficult without more information about the product and Bob's needs. 
2. **Find a Compromise:** Explore options like payment plans, bonuses, or additional services that bridge the gap.

**The Offer (Without More Information)**

Given the limited information, the strongest approach is a firm but polite offer near your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob is open to it.

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to explore options."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable Price:** The price is slightly below your guaranteed amount but signals the product's worth.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer or discuss alternative arrangements. 

**Important Note:**  To increase the chances of a successful negotiation with Bob, you'll need to uncover more about why the product is valuable to him. This will help tailor your pitch and potentially find a mutually beneficial deal."
