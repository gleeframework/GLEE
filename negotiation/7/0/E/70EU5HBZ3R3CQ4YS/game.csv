"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value to me and leaves room for us both to benefit from a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
