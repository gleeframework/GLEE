"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $119. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better price. Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a subsequent attempt to make the sale. You can always fall back on buying from John for $120 if needed."
