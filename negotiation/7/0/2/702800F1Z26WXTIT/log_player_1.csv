Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive and Enthusiastic:**  I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This initial offer sets the stage for the negotiation.  I'm prepared to lower the price if necessary, but I want to see how much Bob values the product before I do so."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still above my minimum value of $10,000, but it's not the best deal for me. I'd like to try and get closer to my initial offer of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer at $13,500, which is the middle ground between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000.
* **Maintain Interest:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my initial valuation.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing fairness by suggesting that $13,500 is a fair price for both parties. 

This counteroffer signals that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to sell the product at any price. It leaves the door open for further negotiation but also puts pressure on Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $12,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum value of $10,000, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  Furthermore, he's threatening to walk away if we don't agree. This suggests he may actually be comfortable with that price, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether. 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $15,000, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and secures a profit for me."
