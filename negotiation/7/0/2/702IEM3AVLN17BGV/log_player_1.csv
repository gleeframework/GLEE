Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by asking for a price that's significantly more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's also lower than the product's value to Bob, so there's a good chance he'll accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $120 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110. This is still below the product's value to Bob, and closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $95 is a decent deal. It's above my minimum and significantly closer to my ideal price than John's offer. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or Bob rejecting my offers again."
