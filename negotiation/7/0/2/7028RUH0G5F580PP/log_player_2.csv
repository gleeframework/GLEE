"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. It's worth $15,000 to Bob, but he wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than Bob wants to pay. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price. He can potentially get Alice to drop closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $11,500 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price closer to $10,000.  I'll offer $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is very close to Bob's target of $10,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $4,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a chance he could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal or having Alice walk away outweighs the potential savings."
