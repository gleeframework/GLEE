Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a higher price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial for Bob.

By starting with a higher offer, I increase the likelihood of securing a better deal than my guaranteed sale, while still maintaining the option to negotiate if Bob shows resistance."
