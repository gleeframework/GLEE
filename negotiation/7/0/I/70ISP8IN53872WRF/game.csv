"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I'm getting close to my limit, but I really want to make this deal work.",10250.0,Bob,4,
