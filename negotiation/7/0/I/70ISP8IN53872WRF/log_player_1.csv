Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I'm getting close to my limit, but I really want to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $10,250 is a good price, and I'm confident that I can get a better price in future negotiations. It's important to remember that I'm not guaranteed to get a better price from John, and it's always better to close a deal than to risk losing a sale altogether."
