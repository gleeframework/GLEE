{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to maximize potential profits while acknowledging the possibility of a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my initial offer. I will attempt to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
