"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  It's highly unlikely Alice will come down to a price you'd accept in one round. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  Unfortunately, $18,000 is quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. It's significantly lower than her asking price but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Respectful:** The message maintains a positive tone and expresses interest in the product while clearly stating the price is an issue.
* **Strategic Goal:** The goal is to get Alice to reveal more about her acceptable price range. Her response will guide your next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident in the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice came down in price, but $14,000 is still above your $12,000 maximum. 
* **Negotiating Tactic:** Her language (""one-time offer,"" ""not sure if I can go any lower"") is likely a negotiation tactic. She might be willing to go lower with further persuasion.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You have the fallback option of John's $12,000 offer, which gives you bargaining power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $14,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I could do $11,000.  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise but keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to your range.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""ready to close the deal today"" can encourage Alice to make a decision and potentially accept your offer.
* **Below, But Close:** The offer of $11,000 is still below your absolute maximum but gives Alice a chance to make a small profit over selling to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her ""final offer"" and ""lowest [she] can go."" It's unlikely she'll budge further.
* **Over Budget:**  Even though Alice came down significantly, $13,000 is still $1,000 over your maximum budget.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000. It makes more sense to secure the product at your target price than risk further negotiation with Alice, who might not budge."
