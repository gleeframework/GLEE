"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  Unfortunately, $18,000 is quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident in the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $14,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I could do $11,000.  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're interested.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
