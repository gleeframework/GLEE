Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him a reason to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still significantly above your minimum of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear signal of your desired price range:** This sets the tone for the negotiation and gives Bob a starting point for his counter-offer.

Remember, the key is to be firm but flexible, and be prepared to make counter-offers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $1,050,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your desired price point. You're in a strong position here because you have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay your minimum. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  You've shown you're not desperate for a sale and are willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Signal your expectations:** You can send a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price, demonstrating your commitment to getting a good deal.
* **See if Bob is willing to go higher:**  Bob may be willing to increase his offer if he realizes you're not going to accept a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This shows you are willing to negotiate.
* **Staying above your minimum:** $1,075,000 is still above your minimum of $1,200,000,  leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Clear message of your expectations:** This sets a new price point for the negotiation and signals that you are serious about getting a good deal.

By offering a slightly lower price, you're demonstrating flexibility while also maintaining your desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I can offer $1,025,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still below your minimum price of $1,200,000. You've already been through multiple rounds of negotiation and Bob has stated this is his final offer. Continuing to negotiate with Bob will likely lead to further concessions on your part, ultimately resulting in a lower sale price.

Considering you have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay your minimum price, it's best to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This ensures you get the best possible price for your product and saves you further time and effort."
