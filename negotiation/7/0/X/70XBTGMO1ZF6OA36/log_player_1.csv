Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $100, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $99 is just above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still a good deal for him compared to not getting the product at all.  
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and highlights the ""special price"" to entice Bob."
