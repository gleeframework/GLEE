"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $7,000 is too low, and I can still get more from Bob or sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $8,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle again at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'll choose to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd like to get more from Bob, the negotiations are getting more difficult, and it's becoming clear that he's not willing to pay a price that's fair to me.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and I can't risk going further and potentially ending up with less than $8,000."
