Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A high starting price could immediately turn him off.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your minimum ($15,000) as possible.  If Bob rejects, you'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations with him or going with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than your initial offer of $12,000. Accepting his offer would mean losing a significant amount of money.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price, hopefully closer to your desired range. While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially lead to a higher price than $15,000.  

It's worth exploring if there's room for compromise before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $10,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of your bottom line. 
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the price (minimum asking price) and also highlights the potential value to Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** While $11,500 is still higher than Bob's initial offer, it's lower than your previous offer, leaving room for potential agreement. 

This counteroffer balances the need to secure a reasonable price while still keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
