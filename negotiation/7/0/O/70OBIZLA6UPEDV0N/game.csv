"Bob, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $10,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
