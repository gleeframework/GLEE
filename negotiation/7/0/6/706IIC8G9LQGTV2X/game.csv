"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows for a successful transaction for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $900000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you and the potential for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 remains above my budget.  I'm offering $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to be realistic about the product's value and my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and the potential for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
