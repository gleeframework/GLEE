"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great price for a high-quality product, so let's try to make this work!",135.0,Alice,3,
