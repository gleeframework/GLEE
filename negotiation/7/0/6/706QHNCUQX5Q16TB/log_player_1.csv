Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, potentially saving you considerable resources and increasing your profitability. This offer represents a unique chance to acquire it at a price below its true worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000) but still attractive to Bob, who values it at $1,200,000.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,100,000 leaves a $100,000 profit margin for Bob, incentivizing him to accept.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly creating a sense of urgency and opportunity.

This strategy seeks to secure the highest possible profit while considering Bob's willingness to pay and the guaranteed fallback option of selling to John."
