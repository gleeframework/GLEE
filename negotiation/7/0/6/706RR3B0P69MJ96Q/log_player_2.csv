"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best move. This allows you to try to negotiate a lower price without immediately resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's a step in the right direction, but you're better off rejecting it and making another counteroffer. You can try to meet her halfway again, but at a slightly lower price, to see if you can come to a mutually agreeable price."
