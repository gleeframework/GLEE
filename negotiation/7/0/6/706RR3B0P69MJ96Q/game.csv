"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that lets you make a good profit, and I can afford it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
