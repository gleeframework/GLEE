"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to start with an offer higher than your minimum ($800,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the high initial offer without revealing your hand completely. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording ""initial proposal"" and ""starting point for our discussion"" signals that you are open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below both your minimum and his own stated value. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. Rejecting his offer keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 represents the high end of this product's value, $750,000 falls significantly short. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stand Firm:** Coming down from $1,000,000 to $925,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate without giving up too much ground. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  Re-emphasize the product's ""true worth"" to justify the still-high price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation alive while moving closer to a price point above your minimum. It encourages Bob to continue engaging and potentially reveal more about his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value you place on the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered a price above your minimum ($800,000) and his initial offer ($750,000). While you could potentially push for more, there's a risk he may walk away. Accepting $850,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
