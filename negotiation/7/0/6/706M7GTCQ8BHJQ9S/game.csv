"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 represents the high end of this product's value, $750,000 falls significantly short. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value you place on the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,4,
