Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit. I believe this offer is reasonable, and I'm confident that Bob will see its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale before he backs out or I lose time with more counteroffers. It's important to weigh potential gains against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
