"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the maximum you're willing to pay is $10,000, Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum is $10,000, I'm offering $9,000 as a starting point. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and shows my serious intent to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will entice Alice to consider a deal closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum, I still have room to negotiate. I'd rather try to push for a lower price and see if I can get it closer to $9,000 or even slightly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice seems willing to come down from her initial price, I'm going to increase my offer by $500. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough to convince Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to pay closer to $9,500, Alice's offer of $10,200 is only $200 more than my maximum.  Considering I've already rejected a couple of offers, it's likely that further negotiation might push the price even higher.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product."
