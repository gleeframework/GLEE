Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** $13,000 is above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob's perceived value of $15,000 allows for some negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** By offering a price lower than Bob's maximum value, you increase the likelihood he'll accept, rather than immediately rejecting your offer.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with. This offer sets the stage for a productive negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more agreeable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price that's still within your budget and allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your desired value.  Would you consider $11,500? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $500 less than your last counteroffer of $12,000.  Considering your minimum acceptable price is $10,000, accepting this offer is a good choice.  You're getting a decent profit and avoiding further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a potential stalemate."
