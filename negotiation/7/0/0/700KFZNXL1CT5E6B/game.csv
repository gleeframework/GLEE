"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still believe that this product has a lot to offer and will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $16000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
