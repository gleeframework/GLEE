"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the immense value it will bring to your endeavors. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, there's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you time to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.**  If the negotiation fails, you have a guaranteed option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has come down from her initial price, it's still above what you're comfortable paying.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.**  You can continue to try and get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John remains a fallback option.** It's good to keep that in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  I'm confident this is a price that reflects the product's value and enables you to make a profitable sale."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay firm at $890,000. This price accurately reflects the value and potential this product offers. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target price.** She's now offering $890,000, which is only $40,000 above your ideal price.
* **You're nearing the midpoint of the negotiations.** With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming riskier to continue pushing for a lower price. You might not have enough time to reach a better deal.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  However, with Alice's offer getting closer to your limit, the risk of not getting a deal with her is growing.

At this point, accepting the offer seems like the most sensible choice. It saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John and allows you to secure the product."
