Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm very interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?  That would be a great starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still a good price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8500?  That would be a fair compromise and allow us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8700. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has been able to negotiate the price down from $9,500 to $8,700.  While he could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of the deal falling apart and having to pay John $12,000 is high.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product at a good price."
