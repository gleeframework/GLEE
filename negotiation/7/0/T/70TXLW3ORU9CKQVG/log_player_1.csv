"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to my ideal value.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offer:** I don't want to start with a price that is so high that Bob immediately rejects it. This allows for some back-and-forth.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1800000. I understand if this doesn't align with your valuation, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Value:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value, but there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on the possibility of earning more.  Rejecting it allows me to maintain control and continue exploring potential higher offers.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I'm willing to take a slight risk for a potential higher reward.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will craft a counter-offer, likely somewhere between Bob's offer and my initial offer. I'll aim for a price that balances maximizing my profit while still being reasonable enough to keep Bob in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to find a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and fits within your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and could increase the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product while also acknowledging Bob's budget considerations. This approach aims to make my offer more appealing and less likely to be rejected.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While this is a significant concession, it's still above my minimum acceptable price. This allows me to potentially secure a more favorable outcome while still having room to adjust if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response to this counter-offer. If he rejects it, I will adjust my strategy based on the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your proposal and am willing to move forward with a price of $1850000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that suits both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This means I'm already very close to my goal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially try to push for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a rejection and force me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time Factor:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to secure a deal quickly.  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing out on a sale.

**Decision:**

I've decided to accept Bob's offer for $1,850,000. This provides me with a significant profit while also ensuring a successful sale in a timely manner."
