"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, which is my maximum limit for this purchase. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is still a great value for this unique product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this product.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $800000, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $1000000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm  firmly sticking to my offer of $800000.  It's a fair price considering my limited budget and  the value you've placed on the product.  If you're not willing to accept this offer,  I'll have to move on to other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
