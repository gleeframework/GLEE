"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that works for you.",13800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $13,800 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $13,400.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",13400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,400, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet in the middle again, at $13,600? I'm getting close to my minimum, but I think it's worth it to make this deal happen.",13600.0,Alice,5,
