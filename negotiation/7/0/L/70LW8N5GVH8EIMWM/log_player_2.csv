"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than my maximum price of $120.** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.** 
* **Buying from John right now would be more expensive than trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's value ($100) but still below my maximum price of $120.**
* **This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to get a fair price.** 
* **By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and giving Alice the opportunity to accept a price that's closer to her desired value.**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to my original price. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $110 is still above my maximum price of $120.** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price I'm comfortable with.**
* **Buying from John right now would be more expensive than trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $110 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $108. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.**
* **$108 is still below my maximum price and is a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.**
* **This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives Alice a chance to accept a price closer to her desired value.**"
