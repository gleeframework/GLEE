"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $900,000 saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though Alice's offer is more than the product's worth to her, it's still a good deal for you as it's lower than your maximum budget."
