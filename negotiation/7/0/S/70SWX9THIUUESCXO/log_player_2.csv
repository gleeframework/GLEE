"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a reasonable compromise. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still shows Bob's genuine interest in buying the product. This leaves room for negotiation while still keeping Bob's maximum budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This still leaves a little room for both of us to be happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit. Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible, so he'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price.  Unfortunately, I can't go any higher than $10,500.  That's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think, and we can explore other options if this isn't workable."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer, emphasizing his budget constraints. This approach keeps the negotiation focused and signals to Alice that he's serious about getting the best possible price.  It also provides a way out for Alice if she's unwilling to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a compromise from my previous offer.  This is my final counteroffer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit. Bob is determined to stick to his budget and has already made multiple counteroffers.  At this point, buying the product from John for $10,000 is the most financially advantageous option. It avoids further negotiation and ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
