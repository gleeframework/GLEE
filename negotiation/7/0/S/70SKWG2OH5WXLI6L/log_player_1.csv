Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair deal that reflects its significant value."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation. 

This offer balances ambition with a degree of realism, increasing the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price significantly above Alice's minimum."
