Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to see how much he values the product and provides room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's less than what John is offering. I'll counteroffer and see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above John's offer. I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, and it's getting closer to my desired price. Accepting his offer secures a sale and maximizes my profit at this point."
