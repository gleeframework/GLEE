"Round 1

# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Alice's offer is still a bit high, and we're only in round 3. There's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my desired price point.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, as we're only halfway through the rounds and John's offer is still significantly higher than what Alice is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and is closer to your last offer. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
