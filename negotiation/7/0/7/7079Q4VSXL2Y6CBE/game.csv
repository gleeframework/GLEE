"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and is closer to your last offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
