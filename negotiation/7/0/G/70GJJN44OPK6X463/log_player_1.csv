"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $17,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good price.  Since I can sell to John for $15,000, I'm willing to go lower if necessary, but I want to see what Bob's reaction is first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to his value of $12,000. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where we can both find a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a great offer! Bob is now willing to pay my minimum of $15,000. Accepting this offer guarantees me the best possible outcome."
