Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,500,000 from John, but I believe it's a reasonable price point that still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:** This price gives me a chance to earn more than my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to pay more, but might also negotiate a lower price. 
* **Not too aggressive:**  A price too far above John's offer could scare Bob away. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit."
