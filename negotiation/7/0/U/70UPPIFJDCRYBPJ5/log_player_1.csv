I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a good deal, I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further.  It's not worth risking losing the sale and ending up with less than I could get from John."
