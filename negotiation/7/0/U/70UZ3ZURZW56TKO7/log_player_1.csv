Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).**  This ensures you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's estimated value ($1,000,000).** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

This allows for potential negotiation and gives you a good chance to maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target value through further negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to compromise a bit by lowering my price to $900,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is a decent compromise. It's higher than John's offer and a good profit for me. It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
