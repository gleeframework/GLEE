{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer leaves some room for negotiation but still allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm also being friendly and open to a discussion, which could lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my budget under $13,000 if possible. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my initial offer of $14,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Would you consider $13,500? This would be a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a fantastic deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my spending below $13,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $12,800? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,800 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum price of $12,000 and it seems he's unlikely to budge much further.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
