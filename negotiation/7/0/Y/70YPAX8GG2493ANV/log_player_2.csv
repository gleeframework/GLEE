"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your desired price range.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still being a fair price for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you've mentioned, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still within your desired price range of $1,000,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer at $1,150,000 saves you the risk and still allows you to acquire the product for a reasonable price."
