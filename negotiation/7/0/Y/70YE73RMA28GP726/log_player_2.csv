"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. It's better to negotiate for a lower price or buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $700,000, we're anchoring the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of our $800,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Collaborative Tone:** The message aims to maintain a positive and collaborative tone, which can be helpful in negotiations.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us a better understanding of Alice's flexibility and help gauge how low she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground, I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, $850,000 is still above our maximum budget. There's space to negotiate further.
* **John as a Backup:** We have John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net.  This gives us leverage to continue negotiating with Alice. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** We can use the next round to propose a price closer to John's offer, putting pressure on Alice to either accept or potentially lose the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  Increasing the offer to $750,000 shows Alice that we are willing to negotiate and move closer to her price range.
* **Anchoring to John's Offer:**  By staying well below Alice's $850,000 and closer to John's $800,000 offer, we are implicitly reminding her that we have an alternative option. 
* **Seeking a Compromise:** The message emphasizes that we are looking for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still not enough for me. My minimum acceptable price is $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice Met Our Limit:** Alice has come down to our maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Matches John's Offer:** There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as we can buy the product for the same price from John.
* **Securing the Deal:**  By accepting now, we avoid the risk of Alice potentially retracting this offer or further complications arising in the negotiation."
