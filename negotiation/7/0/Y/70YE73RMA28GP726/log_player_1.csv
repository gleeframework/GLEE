Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you don't lose out on too much money if Bob accepts.
* **It sets a clear starting point:** This helps structure the negotiation process.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counter-counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,000,000. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping that a counter-counteroffer will lead to a more acceptable agreement. If not, I'm prepared to move on to John and sell the product for $1,000,000."

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for anything less than $800,000.
