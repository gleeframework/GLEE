Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I believe this price point would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
