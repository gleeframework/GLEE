Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $14,000. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting high allows you to potentially get closer to your product's true value. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're starting from a strong position.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at a ""discount,"" giving Bob the impression that he might get a better deal if he negotiates.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):** By not mentioning John outright, there's an implicit time limit for Bob.  He might feel like he needs to act quickly before someone else buys the product.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know John exists, Bob doesn't.  Your messaging needs to be convincing enough for him to accept the offer without knowing your fallback option.
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a range in mind that you're comfortable accepting."
