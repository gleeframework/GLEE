Alice's offer:

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've managed to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000, saving you $450,000 from John's price and $150,000 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice has indicated this is her lowest price. Further negotiation might be fruitless and risk the deal. 
* **Strong Position:** You've consistently moved towards your target price, showing you're a serious buyer. Accepting now leverages that."
