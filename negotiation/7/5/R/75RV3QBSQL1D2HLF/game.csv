"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I really need to stay within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $13,250. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $12,750. I've already stretched my budget to its limits, and I really need to stick to it. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be my best option.",12750.0,Bob,8,
