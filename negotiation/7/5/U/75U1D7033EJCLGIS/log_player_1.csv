{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation, hoping to maximize my profit while still being appealing to him. This leaves room for negotiation if he counters. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $95 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $70 is a big drop. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is much closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer more, it's still a profitable sale for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
