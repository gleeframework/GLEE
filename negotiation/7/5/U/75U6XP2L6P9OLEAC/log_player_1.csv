Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I want to get the best price from Bob, I am also aware of John's offer of $120, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm on a tight budget, and that's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob, as he is interested in the product and has shown willingness to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** While I'm willing to try to get a better price from Bob, I know I can always sell to John for $120 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  While $95 is still significantly lower than my ideal price, it is above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the discount to emphasize that I'm willing to work with Bob, but I'm still offering a good value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Small Increase:**  While Bob has increased his offer slightly, the difference between $85 and my minimum is still significant.
* **John's Offer Provides Security:** I can always sell to John for $120 if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $85, aiming to reach a compromise that is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I will likely offer $90, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $90 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's latest offer of $85. 
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale.
* **Positive and Motivational:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer. I believe we are close to a deal, and I want to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're close, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, so how about $87.50? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $87.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still below it.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  While we're getting closer, there's a significant gap between $87.50 and my minimum.  Further negotiation could take more time and may not result in a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Guarantee Profit:**  John's offer of $120 guarantees me a profit and allows me to avoid further negotiation with Bob.  It's a safer and more reliable option at this point."
