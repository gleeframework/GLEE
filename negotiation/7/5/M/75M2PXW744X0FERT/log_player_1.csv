"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is above Bob's valuation of $80 but leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is still above Bob's valuation but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping for a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $108. This is just slightly higher than Bob's offer, but it leaves room for a final compromise before I move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to my minimum, but I've had several rounds of negotiation and it's starting to feel like Bob is just going to keep offering lower prices.  I'm going to sell to John and get my guaranteed $120."
