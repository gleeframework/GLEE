Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to negotiate down. Starting high gives you a better chance of securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the value to Bob, the message hints at the product's worth, encouraging him to seriously consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains open for negotiation, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging that a rejected offer isn't a loss, thanks to John's standing offer."
