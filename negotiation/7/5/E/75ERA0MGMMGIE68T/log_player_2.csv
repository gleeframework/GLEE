"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this reflects a fair value that acknowledges its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:** Bob reiterates his previous offer, demonstrating that he's serious about getting a better price.
* **Reinforcing Value:** He emphasizes that $850,000 is fair, acknowledging the product's value but also highlighting the potential for both parties to gain from a deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved significantly closer to Bob's desired price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Near Optimal Price:** $887,500 is still a good deal for Bob, significantly lower than John's price and closer to his initial target.
