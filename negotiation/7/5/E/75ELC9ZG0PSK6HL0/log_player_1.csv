Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to sell the product, $80 is way too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110?  This still gives you a good discount, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with that number. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $95 still isn't quite working for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While $97.5 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're being persistent, and I appreciate that. Let's just settle this already, how about we meet in the middle and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob is being stubborn, and it's getting frustrating. I don't want to waste any more time with this negotiation. John is a reliable buyer, and I'm guaranteed a good price from him."
