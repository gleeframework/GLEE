"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's significantly more than both my limit and John's offer.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better price with Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What would you say?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. It's still significantly below my $8,000 limit, giving me space to increase my offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While $9,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 7000}

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming to stay below my $8,000 limit.  This offer leaves some room for a final compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's in the middle of our previous discussions, so I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $8,000. This ensures I get the product at the best possible price for me."
