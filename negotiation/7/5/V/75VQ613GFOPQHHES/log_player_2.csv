It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a clear alternative with John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  Since I have a backup option with John, I can afford to be a bit bolder and see if Alice is willing to come down significantly."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a better price than her last offer. This keeps the pressure on and hopefully leads to a deal closer to my target."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still a bit higher than where I want to be, but we're getting closer. I'll keep negotiating and see if we can reach a deal before I have to resort to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm willing to meet halfway. I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept and close the deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now within my target price range. It's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal, rather than risking her rejecting my counteroffer again or potentially needing to resort to buying from John for a significantly higher price."
