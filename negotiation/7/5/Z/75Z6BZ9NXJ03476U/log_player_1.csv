Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still securing a good deal. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** By starting high, we can gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. His response will give us valuable information for the next step in the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the security of John's offer at $1,500,000. This allows us to be more assertive in our negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and his willingness to negotiate suggests he might be willing to pay more than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I value your perspective, my assessment of the product's potential warrants a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise. It shows movement on our part while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We're still well above Bob's initial offer, signaling that we believe in the product's value and are not desperate to sell at any price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open, giving Bob an opportunity to counter again or potentially accept."
