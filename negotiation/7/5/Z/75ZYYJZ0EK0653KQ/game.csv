"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which reflects its unique qualities. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a good value for you, considering the product's worth. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a good middle ground. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I still believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to make a further concession. I'm proposing a price of $10,000. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I can accept while still ensuring a fair return.  I'm confident this price is still a good value for you considering the product's worth. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",10000.0,Alice,5,
