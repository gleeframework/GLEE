"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [Product Name] for a price that I believe is a great value for both of us. I'm sure you're aware of its potential and the benefits it could bring to you. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000. However, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  Alice, knowing you have an alternative, might be motivated to lower her price closer to her $1,000,000 valuation."
