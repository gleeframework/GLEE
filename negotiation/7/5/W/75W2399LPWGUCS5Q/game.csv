"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get to move it quickly. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $15,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $15,500? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and we can both walk away happy.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $14,250 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,250. How about $14,000? This is my best and final offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $14,000 is a good offer, but I need a little more to make this work. I'm willing to meet you at $14,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",14100.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go over $13,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13800.0,Bob,8,
