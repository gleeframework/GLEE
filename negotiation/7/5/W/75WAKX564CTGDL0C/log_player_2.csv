"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,000,000. John offers a guaranteed price that meets my needs."
