I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on something around $900,000? I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
