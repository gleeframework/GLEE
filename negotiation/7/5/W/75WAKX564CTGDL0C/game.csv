"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on something around $900,000? I believe that's a fair price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking to get closer to $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
