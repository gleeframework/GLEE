Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price:** This makes the offer attractive to Bob.
* **It still leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, we can haggle.
* **It's higher than what Bob values the product at:** This gives me some leverage in the negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counter-counteroffer. I'll always keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even below the value he himself assigned to the product ($800,000). While I'm open to negotiation, I need to maintain my value and not settle for a deal that significantly undervalues my product.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $900,000. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as my fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price and a fair value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** I'm not completely dismissing Bob's offer, but I'm not accepting it either.
* **Bridge the gap:**  $850,000 is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial counteroffer.
* **Keep pressure on Bob:** This shows that I am not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if needed.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more enticing to Bob, but I am prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $825,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **It's a significant improvement over his previous offer:** This shows that he's serious about buying and is willing to negotiate.
* **It's closer to the value Bob assigned to the product:**  This suggests a win-win situation.
* **It's a good return on my investment:**  $825,000 is a substantial amount of money and it's worth closing the deal without further delays. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I avoid the risk of further negotiation rounds and potential delays.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, but it's not worth the added time and effort to secure a slightly higher price."
