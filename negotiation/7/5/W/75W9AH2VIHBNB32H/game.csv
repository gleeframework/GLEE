"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900,000, which is still a premium price for me, but I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product truly offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has exceptional value, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $1,025,000. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price considering the market value. Can you meet me at this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and reasonable price.",1010000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,010,000 is the right price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $980,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you make a decision?",980000.0,Bob,8,
