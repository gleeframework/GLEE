"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  $950000 is simply not enough for me to part with the product.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $1100000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a middle ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
