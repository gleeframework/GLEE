"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to haggle Alice down further, accepting the $140 offer is a good deal. You save $10 compared to buying from John and stay well below your $150 maximum."
