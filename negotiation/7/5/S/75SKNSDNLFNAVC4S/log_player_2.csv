"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since there's an alternative option with John at a much lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
