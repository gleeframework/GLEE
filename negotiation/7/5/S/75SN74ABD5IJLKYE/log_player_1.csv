Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  A starting price of $2,000,000 aims to capture as much of the potential surplus as possible.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stated, the message implies the ""incredible value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might need to adjust your approach in subsequent interactions."
