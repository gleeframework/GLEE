# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. For this unique opportunity, I am offering the product to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $140. It is better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, $140 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate your offer while still valuing our product appropriately, I propose to sell the product to you for $135. I hope this revised price works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. While $135 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $130. It's the absolute maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my product, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product to you for $132. This is the best price I can offer, given its value and the fact that it's worth $120 to you. I hope this meets your budget requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice has offered $132, which is still above Bob's preferred price of $120.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's likely that the price will only drop a small amount, and it's not worth the potential for a stalemate.  Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum price, it's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to purchase the product from John."
