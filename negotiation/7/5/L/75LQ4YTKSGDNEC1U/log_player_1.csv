"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential benefit to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not setting a rigid price but inviting Bob to engage in a discussion.

**Strategy:** 

This opening offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and create a starting point for negotiation. I'm leaving room to lower the price if necessary, but I'm not giving away too much value in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** I will reject this offer and continue the negotiation with Bob. I will make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price but still acknowledges Bob's lower valuation.
* **John as a backup:** While I'm open to finding a deal with Bob, I'll keep John in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, considering its worth to me and your needs. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-argument:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate my own valuation by referencing the product's worth to me.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive language:** The message remains positive and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while remaining open to further negotiation. I'm confident that I can reach a mutually beneficial deal while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss, and I'm confident that I can continue negotiating to secure a better deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** I will reject this offer and continue the negotiation with Bob. I will make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, pushing for a more favorable outcome.
* **John as a backup:** I'll keep John in mind as a backup option, especially if the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle.  How about we split the difference again and try $82.50?  I'm trying to be fair here, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again offering to split the difference, showing a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. This maintains a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Fairness appeal:**  I'm reiterating the idea of fairness, suggesting that the proposed price benefits both parties. 
* **Slight push:**  While I'm coming down on my price, I'm not giving in completely. I'm still pushing for a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental approach:**  By gradually decreasing my price, I'm aiming to find the point where Bob is willing to accept while still ensuring a profitable deal for myself. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm still mindful of John as a backup option and am prepared to walk away if Bob continues to be unreasonable."
