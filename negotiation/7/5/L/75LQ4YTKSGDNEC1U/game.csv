"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, considering its worth to me and your needs. Let's make this work!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle.  How about we split the difference again and try $82.50?  I'm trying to be fair here, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us.",82.5,Alice,5,
