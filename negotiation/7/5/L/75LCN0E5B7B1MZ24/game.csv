"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's market value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's full worth, I value reaching an agreement. Would you consider $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",975000.0,Bob,6,
