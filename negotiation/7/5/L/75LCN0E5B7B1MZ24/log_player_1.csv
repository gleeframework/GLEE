Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has remained stagnant in his offers. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his price from $975,000. At this point, continuing the negotiation risks losing time and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed offer.  Selling to John ensures receiving the full value of the product."
