"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $10000 is a bit outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9500 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
