Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $10000 is a bit outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9500 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  $9,000 is a reasonable offer and a good compromise. I'm happy to accept it and move forward with the sale."
