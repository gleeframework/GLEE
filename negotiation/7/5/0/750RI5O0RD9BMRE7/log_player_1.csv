Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I think you'll be very happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, which could still be very profitable for Alice. 
* **John as a Backup:** Alice has the security of John's offer, ensuring she won't be forced to accept anything less than $12,000.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the potential for negotiation and the safety net of a guaranteed sale to John."
