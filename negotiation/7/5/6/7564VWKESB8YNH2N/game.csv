"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1700000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1350000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I understand your budget concerns. While $1350000 is still a bit below my minimum,  I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'm offering the product to you for $1450000. This price reflects both the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to other offers.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
