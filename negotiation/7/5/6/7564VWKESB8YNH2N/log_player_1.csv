``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Fairness:** I use the word ""fair"" to imply that this price is reasonable, without revealing my minimum price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, but also that I'm confident in the product's worth.

This is just a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and my knowledge of his potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

* **Aiming for a higher price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a better price in the next round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1350000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. I will need to carefully consider how much further I can lower my price without jeopardizing my minimum requirement."
