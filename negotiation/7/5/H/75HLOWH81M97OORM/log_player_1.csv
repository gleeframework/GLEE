Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer sets the price at $1,000,000. Here's why:

* **Maximizing Profit:** This offer allows me to earn significantly more than the $800,000 I would receive from John.
* **Appeal to Bob:** It's a lower price than the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000), making it an attractive deal for him.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could offer a higher price, there's a greater chance Bob might reject it. This offer balances maximizing my earnings with the potential of Bob accepting."
