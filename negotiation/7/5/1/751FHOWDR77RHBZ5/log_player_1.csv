Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 
 
This offer is slightly below what you could get from John, leaving room for potential negotiation with Bob. It's high enough to be appealing to Bob, as it's still less than the product's worth to him.  If Bob rejects, you can then move forward with selling to John for $12,000."
