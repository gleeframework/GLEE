# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to bring it down to a more reasonable range. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's try $10500. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good balance between our two numbers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget, but I don't think there's much room for her to come down further.  Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's better to go with the sure thing and avoid the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
