"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good price, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $9,000. It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to make this deal work.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again, and I'm willing to go down to $9,625. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price. What do you say?",9625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,625 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to explore other options.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're serious about this offer, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $9,437.50. This is a very reasonable price, considering the quality of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement before we run out of time.",9437.5,Alice,7,
