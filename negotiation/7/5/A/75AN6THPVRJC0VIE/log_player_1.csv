Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this great product for a limited time at $95. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below your minimum ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit higher gives you room to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob hesitates, making him feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a backup buyer at your desired price."
