"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,300,000 is a good offer, it's a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for me and still represents a significant value for you.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
