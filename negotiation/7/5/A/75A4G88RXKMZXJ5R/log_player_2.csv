"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to quickly get closer to the middle ground. He's offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $120 and his maximum price of $150. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but also wants to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I sell it to you for $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is significantly closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will not budge further or that he'll reach the 10-round limit and be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within the allotted rounds."
