"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's actually above her own valuation of the product. I should negotiate down, aiming to get a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) to see how much room there is for negotiation. This gives me space to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Polite and Interested:** I want to maintain a positive tone and express my interest in the product while still being firm about my budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $10,500. Would you be interested in that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my price range, $10,500 is still more than I want to pay. I know I have a guaranteed option at $10,000 with John. I'll try to negotiate a bit further with Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500?  That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I'm aiming for a price close to the midpoint between her offer ($10,500) and my previous offer ($8,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting a specific price, I'm trying to move the negotiation towards a close.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm mindful that I can get the product for $10,000 from John, so I won't go above that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice doesn't seem willing to budge below $11,000. It's clear she's trying to maximize her profit, which is understandable. However, I have a solid alternative with John at $10,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal to stay within my budget."
