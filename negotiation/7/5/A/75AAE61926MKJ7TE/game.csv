"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $135, which is a bit more than your initial offer, but still a good deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $112.50. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $112.50 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $130, which is closer to my original price but still a good deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,5,
