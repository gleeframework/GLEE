"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($18,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the deal as worthwhile.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price ($15,000) as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer is high, but it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is low, he recognizes the value of the product. This suggests a possibility for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore that further.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.  I'll need to carefully consider how much to lower my offer to find a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This gives you a good deal, and it's still a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($18,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to take the deal.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I highlight that the offer is a good deal for both of us, emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive and friendly tone is important to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices. If Bob rejects it, I'll need to consider whether to lower my offer further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still unable to meet at $14,000. I would like to propose $12,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation continues:** While Bob's offer is still low, he's showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again. I'll need to carefully consider how much to lower my price to keep the negotiation going while still protecting my minimum price. However, selling to John for $15,000 is always an option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While $12,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm lowering my price by a smaller amount this time ($1,000) compared to previous rounds. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for me.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I reiterate the idea of a fair price for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to see the value in the offer.
* **Urgency Implied:**  I subtly hint at the possibility of closing the deal,  creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while still keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider seriously selling to John for $15,000, as we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer of $13,000. I understand the value of your product and I am willing to pay up to $12,500. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would mean a loss for me. 
* **Negotiation is approaching the end:**  We are already at round 6, and selling to John is a viable option. However, I'm willing to give Bob one more chance to get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, so I'll need to be strategic with my next offer. If Bob rejects my counteroffer in round 7, I'll strongly consider selling to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,750. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a small but significant compromise from my previous offer ($13,000) and is very close to Bob's offer ($12,500). It shows a strong desire to finalize the deal.
* **Urgency:** I reiterate the phrase ""close the deal,"" emphasizing the finality of the offer and encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and enthusiastic tone helps to create a sense of momentum and encourages Bob to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes offer. If Bob rejects it, I will likely sell to John in the next round.  This offer is my final attempt to reach a profitable deal with Bob, while still leaving a small margin for potential future negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer of $12,750. I am willing to pay $12,500 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer of $12,500. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate further and potentially get a better offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and ensures a profit.

**Strategy:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a higher price with Bob, selling to John is the most logical decision at this point. It protects my financial interests and ensures I don't end up with a lower price than my minimum."
