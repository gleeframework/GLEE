"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $14,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I can offer you a slight discount to $13,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and agree on $13,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I can do $13,500, but that's the lowest I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,000, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
