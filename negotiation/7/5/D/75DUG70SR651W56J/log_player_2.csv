Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I can do $13,500, but that's the lowest I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,000, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?

It's time to cut our losses. Alice seems firmly set at $13,500, and we're unlikely to get a better deal from her.  Buying from John at $10,000 ensures we stay within our budget and don't overspend."
