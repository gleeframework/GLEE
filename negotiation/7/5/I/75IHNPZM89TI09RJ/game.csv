"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is fair market value for this type of product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000. Let's be realistic,  this is the fair market value for this product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",12000.0,Bob,4,
