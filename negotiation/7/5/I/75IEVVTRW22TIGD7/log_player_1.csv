Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. However, given my financial constraints, I am unable to meet you at $1,000,000. I would like to propose a price of $980,000. I hope this helps us move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $980,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
