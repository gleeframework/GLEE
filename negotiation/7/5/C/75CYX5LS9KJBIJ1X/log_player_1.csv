Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob a decent discount while still ensuring I make a profit significantly above my minimum price of $150. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price.  I hope this encourages Bob to come up a bit more while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $140 is just above my minimum of $150.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $150.  I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
