"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you while ensuring I get a fair price for my product. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a reasonable deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
