"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you while ensuring I get a fair price for my product. Let's find a middle ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.
