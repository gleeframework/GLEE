"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is closer to my asking price for this product.  It offers significant value that I'm sure you'll appreciate.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll get good value from the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
