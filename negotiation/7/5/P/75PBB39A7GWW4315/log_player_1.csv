Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for your needs and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is closer to my asking price for this product.  It offers significant value that I'm sure you'll appreciate.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll get good value from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While negotiating with Bob might eventually lead to a higher sale price, it's getting risky. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but we're still below John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
