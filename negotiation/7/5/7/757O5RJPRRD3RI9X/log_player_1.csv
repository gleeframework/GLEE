Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $120. This is a bit of a gamble, but I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay that much since he values the product at $100.  If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $110. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, he sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
