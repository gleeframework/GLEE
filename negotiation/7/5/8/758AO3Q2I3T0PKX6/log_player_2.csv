"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still quite a bit above your target.
* **Counteroffer is a better strategy.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You'll only consider buying from John if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows you're serious about saving money.
* **Playing the ""value gap""**:  Alice values the product at $800,000, so this offer is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. 
* **Setting the stage for future negotiations:** By starting with a strong counteroffer, you establish a bargaining position that Alice will likely need to adjust to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction, but not enough.** The offer is closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than your target. 
* **Continuing to negotiate is the best strategy.**  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially secure an even better deal.
* **John remains a fallback option.** While you want to get the best possible price, John's offer provides a safety net in case you can't secure a deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice's perceived value:** By offering $800,000, you're effectively meeting Alice's perceived value of the product. This creates a strong incentive for Alice to accept. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  This counteroffer demonstrates that you're willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.
* **Building momentum:**  After Alice's previous counteroffer, this move shows that you're actively working towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
