"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,500. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a great price for a product that will really benefit your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $9,800 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $10,150? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,900. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,7,
