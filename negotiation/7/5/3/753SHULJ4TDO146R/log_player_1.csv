Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a great deal for a high-quality product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $135, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I think I can still get a bit more from him. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $132.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $133.75? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 133.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $133.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $131.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're at round 6, and while I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, his offers are getting frustratingly close to my minimum price.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's too low. 

John is offering me a price that meets my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that deal. I'm going to sell to John."
