Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  Simply stating a high price without context might make Bob walk away.  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" I'm framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" suggests I'm open to discussing the price further, keeping the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase at my minimum acceptable price."
