"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $850,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe you'd find this product highly valuable. Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
