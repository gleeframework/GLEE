"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $9500.  How about $9000?  This would be a good price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $9000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $9250?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,5,
