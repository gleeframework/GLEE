Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's appealing to Bob (below his maximum value) while still securing a significant profit for yourself.  Going for the highest possible price ($1,200,000) might make Bob hesitate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire it at a price well below its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Acknowledging the product's value sets a positive tone.
* **Attractive Price:** $1,100,000 is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, making it very tempting.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""opportunity"" and ""below true worth"" aspects adds persuasive power.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're in a strong position. You can always counter-offer or proceed with your guaranteed sale to John."
