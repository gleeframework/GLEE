"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $8,500 for it. This would be a fair price considering the product's value to me and would allow me to comfortably purchase it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit outside your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy now.  Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and my original offer of $12,000. I'm offering the product to you for $10,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the negotiation we've had so far. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
