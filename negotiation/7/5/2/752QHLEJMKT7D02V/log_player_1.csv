Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering the value of the product to me, I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $950,000 is better than his initial offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below what I need to consider.  How about $1,050,000? This would give us both a good deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and am willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. I understand this is still above your initial asking price, but I truly believe it's a fair offer considering the value to me. Let's aim for a price that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal for me.  It matches what I can get from John, so there's no need to continue negotiating."
