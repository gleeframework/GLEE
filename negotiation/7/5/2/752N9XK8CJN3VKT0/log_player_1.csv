Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's start with this and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still outside my range.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

We're still significantly below my minimum, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to $1,200,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob hitting my absolute minimum is a stroke of luck, but I'll take it! It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk him lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's price in a later round."
