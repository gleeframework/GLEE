Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer matches John's, there's little incentive to continue negotiating. Bob is unlikely to go significantly higher, and I'm secure knowing John will honor the $1,500,000 price."
