"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,400,000 is still quite high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still gives you a great price for this valuable product.  This is my final offer before I move forward with another buyer. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  This product is truly worth more, and I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 as a final compromise.  It's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",1150000.0,Alice,5,
