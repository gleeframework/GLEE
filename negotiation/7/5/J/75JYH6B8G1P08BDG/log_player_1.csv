"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130 in this round. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and significantly higher than my minimum value. I believe this price is fair and will encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's the same as his previous offer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I've got a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $125. Bob has consistently offered $120, so I'm making a small concession to show that I'm willing to negotiate.  This offer still puts me above my minimum value and leaves room for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or at least get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm offering $120, which is the same as Bob's last offer. We are essentially at a stalemate, and with only a few rounds left, I want to see if Bob is willing to accept this price. This is a good middle ground and a fair price considering our last couple of offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although I'm getting close to the point where selling to John might be a better option, I'm going to try one more time to get a better price from Bob. I have one more round left before I have to make that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

This is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm lowering my offer to $115, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll be forced to sell the product to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Unfortunately, I have to sell to John. Bob is unwilling to meet my price, and I've run out of rounds to negotiate. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob for a higher price, $100 is still better than nothing. I'll have to consider my negotiation strategy for future deals."
