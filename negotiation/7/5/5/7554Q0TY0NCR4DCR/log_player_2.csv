"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it! However, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000? That's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is your limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's closer to his limit, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my $12,000 budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get the price lower.  He still has rounds left and can always choose to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still stuck at my budget of $12,000. I'm happy to close the deal today if you can meet me there.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really committed to the $12,000 price point, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his budget limit, but Alice is still offering a price above his ideal target. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John for $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,250 is still a bit over my budget. I'm really hoping to stay within my $12,000 limit.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer it to you for $12,100. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but not quite there:**  $12,100 is just $100 above Bob's budget. However, there's only one round left.
* **Time is running out:**  Bob has reached the final round of negotiations with Alice.  
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  John is offering the product for Bob's ideal price of $12,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept Bob's counteroffer in the final round.

It's better for Bob to secure the product from John at the best possible price rather than risk not closing a deal with Alice and ending up with a price higher than $12,000."
