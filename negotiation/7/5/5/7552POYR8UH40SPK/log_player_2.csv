Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  The next step is to counteroffer Alice."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still able to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better price than Alice's latest offer.  He should counteroffer Alice again, trying to get closer to his desired price."

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John. While it's tempting to keep negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee she will come down to Bob's desired price. It's better to secure the product for $1,000,000 with John and avoid further risk of a failed negotiation."
