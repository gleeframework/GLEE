Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000.  I know this product would be very valuable to you, and this is a fair price considering its benefits."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We start by aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This allows us to potentially secure the highest possible profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While our ideal price is $14,000, we've left some wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Backup Plan:** We know we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This safety net allows us to confidently aim high with Bob."
