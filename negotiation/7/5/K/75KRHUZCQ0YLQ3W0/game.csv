"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,500.  Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
