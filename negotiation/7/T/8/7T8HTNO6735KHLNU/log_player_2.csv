"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair given its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is too high for Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for some profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price closer to $950,000 to proceed. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $950,000 is still above Bob's preferred maximum. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a higher price, but $950,000 is still out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $900,000. This represents a fair compromise that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's try to close the deal on this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $900,000 is still a bit low.  I'm proposing we settle on $925,000. This gives us both a fair profit while closing the deal. Let's finalize this.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, $925,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $910,000, which is a fair compromise and ensures we both make a good deal. Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this deal work. Let's split the difference and finalize this at $915,000. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $915,000 is within Bob's acceptable range. It's just a little over Bob's ideal price of $910,000, but it's still significantly less than what Alice was initially asking. Accepting this offer ensures a deal and avoids further negotiation. While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice might reject it, leaving Bob with only the option of buying from John for $800,000. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's within his budget."
