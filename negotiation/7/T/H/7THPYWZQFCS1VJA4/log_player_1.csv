"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $180 for it. It's a great deal, considering its value."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I can still make a profit even if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the positive aspects of the product and highlighting the value proposition to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Direct Approach:** I'm clearly stating the price to avoid any ambiguity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would you consider $140 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to accept to avoid further negotiation, I'm going to reject it. I believe there's still room for us to find a price that works for both of us. I'm also confident that I can get a better price from John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $180 to $160. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefit for both of us and encouraging a positive outcome.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I can still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I've already established that I can get the same amount from John. While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, it's not worth risking the deal and potentially having to start over with John. Accepting this offer ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
