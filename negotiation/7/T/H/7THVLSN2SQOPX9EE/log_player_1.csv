Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire this asset, and I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) as possible while ensuring we don't go below our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle at a price above our guaranteed sale to John.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial for Bob. This can make him more receptive to the price.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances that risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
