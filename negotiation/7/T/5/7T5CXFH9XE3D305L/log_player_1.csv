Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation.** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, but also gives you a good starting point.
* **It's below your minimum desired price ($120) but not too far below.** This leaves room for you to accept a lower offer if necessary without losing too much money. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize profit, but also to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent price, it's below my minimum desired price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  This would still give you a great deal on a quality product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a small compromise:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Appeal to the value:** Emphasizing the quality of the product can sway Bob to agree to a slightly higher price. 
* **Keep the door open for further negotiation:** By stating ""a bit too low for me"", I leave room for future concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my ideal value. John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By splitting the difference, I demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Present a specific offer:** This keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids open-ended discussions.
* **Maintain a slightly higher position:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm still aiming for a figure closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $105 is still below my minimum desired price of $120.  While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's statement about considering John's offer suggests he's not going to budge further.  Rather than risk another round of negotiation that might result in an even lower price, I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
