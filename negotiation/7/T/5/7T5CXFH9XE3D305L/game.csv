"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  This would still give you a great deal on a quality product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100",105.0,Bob,6,
