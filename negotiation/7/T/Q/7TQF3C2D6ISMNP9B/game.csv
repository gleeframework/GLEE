"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product! $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down significantly. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. Could you do $17,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. How about we settle at $14,000? This offer reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we seem to be getting closer.  I could potentially go up to $13,000, but that's really the absolute limit for me.  Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,6,
