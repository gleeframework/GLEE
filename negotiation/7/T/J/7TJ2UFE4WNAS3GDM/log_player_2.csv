"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, and I'll continue negotiating to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try $9,000. It's a good compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you at $11,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking to my goal of $8,000 and will continue negotiating. There's still time to reach a deal that works for both of us."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell for $10,000. I'll make one last offer: $11,500. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still too high for me. While we're getting closer, I'm still determined to stay within my $8,000 budget. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, as I still have a few rounds left to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but I need to stick to my budget.  I'm offering $9,500 as a final attempt. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already made a few concessions, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'll meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Alice's final offer, and while it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above my budget. There's only one round left, and I'm not sure if I can convince Alice to go any lower.  I've tried my best to negotiate, but I'm comfortable buying from John for $8,000, which is within my budget and saves me $3,000."
