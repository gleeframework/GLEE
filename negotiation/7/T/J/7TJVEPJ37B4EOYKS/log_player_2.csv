Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to achieve. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value the product holds for you while still allowing me to reach a reasonable selling point. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer.
