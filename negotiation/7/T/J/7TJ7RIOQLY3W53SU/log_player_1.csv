"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially go higher if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **It's a fair initial price:** It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer.  We want to see if we can negotiate a higher price.  We'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great price for you, and it lets me make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
