,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? I think that's a fair price for this product.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? I think that's a fair price for this product.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $80.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",80.5,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $78. I can offer you the product for $79.50. It's my final compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",79.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final compromise, but $79.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $79, but no higher. I hope you can meet me at this price.",79.0,Bob,8,
