"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1000000 is significantly below what I believe this product is truly worth.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price still allows me to achieve my goals while offering you a substantial opportunity.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1100000. Can we discuss further?",1100000.0,Bob,4,,
