{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. My starting price is $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start high in a negotiation, leaving room for compromise.  Since you don't know Bob's value, a high starting point gives you leverage.
* **Justifying the Price:** Mentioning the product's ""significant value"" and ""potential"" helps frame the price as reasonable.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Stating you're open to discussing the price shows flexibility and willingness to find a solution.
* **Floor Price:**  Keep in mind your floor price of $1,200,000. You're willing to sell to John at that price if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, you've achieved a good outcome.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob makes a counteroffer, consider whether it's close enough to your floor price and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* **Walking Away:**  If Bob's counteroffers are too low or the negotiation seems unproductive, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,000,000 is significantly lower than your floor price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for you.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer was very low, he did express a willingness to discuss further. This suggests there's potential to reach a compromise closer to your desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting the offer allows you to maintain leverage in the negotiation. You can make a counteroffer and explore if Bob is willing to increase his bid.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You will need to craft a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to your floor price while still being reasonable for Bob.
* **Consider John:** Keep John's offer in mind. If negotiations with Bob become too protracted or unproductive, you have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe this product is truly worth.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to achieve my goals while offering you a substantial opportunity.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is Close to Floor Price:**  $1,300,000 is just above your floor price of $1,200,000, leaving minimal room for further concessions.
* **Show Willingness to Compromise:**  Stating you're ""willing to come down"" shows flexibility.
* **Highlight Value and Opportunity:**  Reiterating the product's worth and potential benefits to Bob emphasizes the value of the offer.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages further dialogue and negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* **Further Negotiation:** Be prepared to make further concessions if necessary, but stay within your desired range.
* **Walk Away:**  If Bob's counteroffers remain too low or the negotiation stalls, you can still choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1100000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $1,100,000 is below your floor price of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer would mean selling the product for less than your minimum acceptable value.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob expressed a willingness to discuss further, the gap between your desired price and his offer is substantial. Further negotiation may be time-consuming and unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer of $1,200,000 is a safe and guaranteed way to ensure you get at least your minimum desired value. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:**  Since Bob's offers are consistently below your floor price, selling to John guarantees you a good outcome. You can move forward with the sale without further negotiation."
