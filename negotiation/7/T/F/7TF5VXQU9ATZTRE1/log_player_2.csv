"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet all your needs and expectations. Considering its value, I propose a price of $14,500 for it. I believe this offer provides a fair balance between value and cost for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $13,500. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,750.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $13,900 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise while still ensuring a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating the price down. $13,900 is a good deal, and it's only $250 more than his last counteroffer.  There's a risk that if he rejects the offer, Alice might increase the price again. It's better to take the deal and save some money."
