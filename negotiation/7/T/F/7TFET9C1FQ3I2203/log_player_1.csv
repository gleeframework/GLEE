Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it is significantly below my minimum desired price of $120. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I will try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $100 is a fair price. Can you meet me at $105? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping for a higher offer in the next round. I still have 6 rounds left before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $112.50.  That's a fair compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $112.50. How about $106.25? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $106.25 is still below my minimum of $120. I have 4 rounds left before I need to consider selling to John, so I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a solution. However, $106.25 is still a bit too low. Let's try $110 again. It's a good compromise and we're getting closer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to $110. I'm willing to go up to $107.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.50 is better than previous offers, it's still below my minimum of $120. I have two rounds left before I need to consider selling to John. I'm hoping that I can convince Bob to go a bit higher in the next round, but if not, I'm ready to sell to John for my desired price."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  How about we split the difference this time? I'm willing to go down to $109. It's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 109}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I think $107.50 is the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses and move on.  I've reached the final round and Bob's offer of $107.50 is still below my minimum of $120. I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiations with Bob, as I might end up with a lower price.  It's time to accept John's offer of $120, which is more than enough to cover my minimum price and ensure I get a fair return."
