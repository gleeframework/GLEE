"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $100 is a fair price. Can you meet me at $105? That's the best I can do.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $112.50.  That's a fair compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices.  What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $112.50. How about $106.25?,106.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a solution. However, $106.25 is still a bit too low. Let's try $110 again. It's a good compromise and we're getting closer. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $110. I'm willing to go up to $107.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",107.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  How about we split the difference this time? I'm willing to go down to $109. It's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",109.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I think $107.50 is the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price?",107.5,Bob,10,
