"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $9,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:** Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer,  $1,000 below Alice's initial price. This shows he's serious about buying but is also trying to get a better deal.
* **Message:** Bob's message is friendly and emphasizes that he's interested in the product. He also frames the counteroffer as a way to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $9000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9500?  This allows me to make a reasonable profit, while still keeping the deal attractive for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Value vs. Risk:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might become less flexible or even call off the deal.  At $9,500, Bob is still getting a good deal, considering the product's value to him ($12,000) and the risk of buying from John.
* **Time:**  It's early in the negotiation, and Bob doesn't want to waste too many rounds.

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer at $9,500 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point, balancing value and risk."
