"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $10,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message sets a good tone for the negotiation and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Value proposition:**  I emphasize the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $9000? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I believe there's still room for a higher price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  His message suggests he's truly interested, giving me leverage to counter. 
* **Avoiding immediate settlement:**  Selling to John for $8,000 would secure a sale, but I'm aiming for a better deal with Bob.

**Next Round:** I'll propose a price between $9,000 and $10,000 to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500?  This allows me to make a reasonable profit, while still keeping the deal attractive for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $9,500 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:**  ""Reasonable profit"" subtly reinforces the product's worth, without being overly aggressive.
* **Positive closing:**  ""Let's close this deal"" encourages a quick agreement.

**Strategy:** 

I'm hoping to close the deal this round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept his next counteroffer if it's at or above $9,000. I'm still aiming for the highest possible price, but I'm also aware of the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's $8,000 offer."
