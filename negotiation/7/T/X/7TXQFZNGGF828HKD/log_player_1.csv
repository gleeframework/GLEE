"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,200,000) but gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and optimistic to build a good rapport with Bob.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the benefit for both of us, making the offer more appealing. 

**Strategy:**

I'll keep the following in mind for future rounds:

* **Bob's Counteroffers:** Analyze his counteroffers to understand his negotiation strategy.
* **My Time Limit:** I have 10 rounds, so I need to strike a balance between being flexible and ensuring I get a good price.
* **John's Offer:**  Keep John's $1,200,000 offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and also lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested. There's room for negotiation, and I can try to close the gap in the next round.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I'm not there yet. I'm willing to negotiate with Bob for a few more rounds.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. I'll aim to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm reiterating that this price is good for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Remaining Firm:**  $1,000,000 is still above Bob's initial offer, indicating that I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum value. 

**Strategy:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this offer. If he's willing to negotiate further, I may be able to close the deal.
* **John's Offer:** If Bob continues to push for a price that's too low, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer. However, I'm not yet ready to accept a price that's so far below my value.
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my last offer but still higher than Bob's. I'll try to find a middle ground while maintaining my minimum value. 
* **Time Management:** I'm aware that we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, so I need to start closing the deal soon."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, so how about $975,000?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm offering $975,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This further demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting a finalization of the deal, reminding Bob that time is running out.

* **John's Offer:**  If Bob continues to refuse to meet my minimum value, I'll be ready to sell to John for $1,200,000. However, I'm still hoping to close the deal with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob is showing persistence, $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm willing to continue negotiating for now because there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. We are getting closer, but I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's so far below my value.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, I'm hoping to secure a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that is slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll aim for a middle ground, but I won't budge below my minimum value.
* **Time Management:**  We're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, so I need to start closing the deal soon."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more. How about $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Time is running out, so let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($975,000) and Bob's current offer ($925,000). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying firm on my minimum value.
* **Urgency:**  I'm reiterating the time constraint, creating a sense of urgency to motivate Bob to accept the offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $950,000 is a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and equity. 

**Strategy:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  I'll pay close attention to Bob's reaction. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to reconsider my strategy.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still holding onto John's offer as a backup, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob.
* **Last Few Rounds:** We have only a few rounds left, so I need to make a decisive move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $920000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:** Bob's offer is only $10,000 higher than his previous offer, and I'm not confident that he's willing to budge further.
* **John's Offer:** I'm getting close to the end of my negotiation rounds, and I can't risk not getting my minimum value. John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is well above my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not result in a satisfactory outcome. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's not worth jeopardizing my minimum value for a small potential increase in price."
