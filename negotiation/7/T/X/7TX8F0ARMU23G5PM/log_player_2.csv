"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This still offers you a substantial gain over the product's value to you, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price. This offer is fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.
