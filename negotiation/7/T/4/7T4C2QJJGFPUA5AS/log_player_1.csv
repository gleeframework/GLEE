I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum, I think I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $13,000 is still a good deal. It's higher than what John is offering, and it seems like Bob is serious about buying."
