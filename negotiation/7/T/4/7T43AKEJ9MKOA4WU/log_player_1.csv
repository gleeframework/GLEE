Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping we could work something out closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum threshold.  I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
