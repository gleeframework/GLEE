"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I propose we start negotiations at $14,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  It leaves little room for negotiation and it's closer to my maximum budget than it is to Alice's value. By rejecting and countering, I can try to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** This counter-offer aims to significantly shift the negotiation in my favor. While it's a big jump from Alice's starting price, it's still within a potentially acceptable range for her (remember, her value is $10,000).
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason, even if simple, makes the counter-offer seem less arbitrary and more palatable. 
* **Sets the tone:**  Starting with a strong counter shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and won't easily settle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet my needs. In light of our previous discussion, I would like to counter with an offer of $13,000 for the product. This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $13,000 is still too high.  We're early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can get her closer to $12,000.  There's a risk she'll be stubborn, but it's worth another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counter-offer directly proposes a compromise by suggesting the midpoint between her last offer ($13,000) and my previous counter ($11,000). 
* **Fairness emphasis:**  Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise"" aims to make the offer psychologically appealing. 
* **Testing her flexibility:** This counter will reveal if Alice is truly willing to move significantly from her initial offer. If she rejects $12,000, it might be a sign that further negotiation will be difficult."
