"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the deal but $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $115? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $112? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",112.0,Alice,5,
