"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you about this.  I'm looking for a minimum of $2,500,000 for the product. I know it's a significant investment, but its value is undeniable. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I aim to set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial high offer allows me to assess Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will give me valuable information about his budget and priorities. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've left ample room for negotiation. I expect Bob to counter, and I'm prepared to gradually decrease my asking price while remaining aware of my minimum and John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while still remaining within my financial constraints.  I'm eager to make this deal happen, but I need to be within my budget. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. I'll counter-offer to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understanding where you're coming from. While I'm motivated to find a solution that works for us both,  $1,200,000 falls quite short of what I had in mind. I'm willing to come down to $2,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've made a significant reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Bob's Value:** My counter-offer is still substantially above Bob's stated value, giving me room to negotiate further.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps me in a strong position. If Bob is truly interested, he'll need to significantly increase his offer. If not, I'm still in a good place to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $2,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits.  I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price, which also matches John's standing offer. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome in this scenario."
