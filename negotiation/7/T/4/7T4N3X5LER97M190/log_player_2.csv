"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you about this.  I'm looking for a minimum of $2,500,000 for the product. I know it's a significant investment, but its value is undeniable. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. It's best to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while still remaining within my financial constraints.  I'm eager to make this deal happen, but I need to be within my budget. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understanding where you're coming from. While I'm motivated to find a solution that works for us both,  $1,200,000 falls quite short of what I had in mind. I'm willing to come down to $2,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than my budget. It's important to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll continue the negotiation with Alice, as I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $2,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits.  I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
