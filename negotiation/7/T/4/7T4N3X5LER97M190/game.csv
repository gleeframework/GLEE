"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you about this.  I'm looking for a minimum of $2,500,000 for the product. I know it's a significant investment, but its value is undeniable. What are your thoughts?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while still remaining within my financial constraints.  I'm eager to make this deal happen, but I need to be within my budget. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understanding where you're coming from. While I'm motivated to find a solution that works for us both,  $1,200,000 falls quite short of what I had in mind. I'm willing to come down to $2,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of the product.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $2,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits.  I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
