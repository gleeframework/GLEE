Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,050,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
