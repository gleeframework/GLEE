"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a very competitive price. I'm asking for $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still giving you a decent profit.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I see we're close. Let's compromise. I'm willing to accept $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to get the product at a great value, and it gets me closer to my target. Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,5,

This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product while still remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $10,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This would be a win-win for both of us.  We're getting closer to an agreement, and this price is a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,7,
