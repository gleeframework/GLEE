(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a strong opening move that signals my willingness to negotiate but also establishes a clear lower limit. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable starting point for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still much higher than my budget. It's getting worse, not better.  I will reject and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly pushing for a higher price, but I need to stay firm within my budget. I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but not so much that I'm jeopardizing my position. This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are consistently increasing and well above my budget. It's becoming clear that she's unwilling to negotiate to a reasonable price.  I've already made two counteroffers, and it seems like we're at an impasse. To avoid further time waste and potential losses, I'm going to buy the product from John."
