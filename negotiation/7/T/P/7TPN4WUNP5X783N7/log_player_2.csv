"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob! I'm willing to sell this fantastic product to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $140. This is a good deal, but you can get it for even less from John for $150. Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John."
