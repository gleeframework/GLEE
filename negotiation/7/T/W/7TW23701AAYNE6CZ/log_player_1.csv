Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. This way, I maximize my potential profit right away. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer of $105. While it is higher than what the product is worth to him, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $115. This is still above Bob's offer but lower than my initial asking price.  It gives him a better deal than my first offer but still allows me to make a profit that is closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $120 for the product, Bob's counteroffer is still too low. I'm going to sell to John and get my minimum acceptable price.  It's not the best possible outcome, but it ensures I don't lose money."
