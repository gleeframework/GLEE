{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's something you've been looking for, and I know you'll get great value out of it.  I'm confident you'll find the price I'm proposing very attractive.  My offer is $850,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation, but it also positions you to potentially earn more than your minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving and see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $750,000 is just a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That would be a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
