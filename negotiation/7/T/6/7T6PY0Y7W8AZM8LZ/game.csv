"I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a budget and I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm really interested in the product, but I think that's the most I can afford. I'd love to hear if you can meet me at this price.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and I'm willing to negotiate. However, due to the high demand and limited supply of our premium product, I can't go below $12000. This offer includes everything you're looking for and more. Please let me know if this is within your range.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $9500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to make a decision if you can meet me at that price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
