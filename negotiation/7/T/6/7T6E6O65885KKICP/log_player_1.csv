I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite!"

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price for the product."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob's offer is at my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation leading to a lower price. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it's the safest option."
