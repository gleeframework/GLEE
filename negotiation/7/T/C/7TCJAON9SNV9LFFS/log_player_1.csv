{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value of this product is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.  It also signals to Bob that you are serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable about the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, even though it is a good indicator that he is interested. It's better to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you want a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and we could both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal price, it's very close to the value I'd get from John.  At this point, it's worth accepting his offer to secure the deal and avoid further negotiation."
