"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $155. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to make a serious offer.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you at $140, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $145. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",145.0,Alice,7,
