"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still significant room for negotiation. Bob can aim to secure a much lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $950,000 and is still within Bob's budget of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is significantly lower than John's price and still leaves room for potential profit."
