"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
