Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but $7,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. It's a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still too low for me. To be honest, I'm starting to think this deal might not work out.  If we can't find a price that works for both of us, I'll have to move on to another buyer who's willing to pay what this product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's our last chance to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stuck at $9,000 and even using ""last chance"" tactics.  It's unlikely she'll go down to $8,000, and we have a guaranteed option with John at that price. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
