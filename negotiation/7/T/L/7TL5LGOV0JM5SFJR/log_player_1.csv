Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $120 might scare Bob off. This offer balances profitability with the risk of him rejecting and you having to settle for $80 from John."
