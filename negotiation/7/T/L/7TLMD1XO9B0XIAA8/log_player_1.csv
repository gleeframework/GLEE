{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 

By starting with a slightly lower price than Bob's maximum value, I create the potential for a mutually beneficial deal while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell for a loss. 

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This is a compromise price, higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us. 

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable value. It also encourages Bob to consider the deal, as it's closer to his desired price than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to earn more, this is a fair deal considering the negotiation process and Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents me from risking a further decline in price or a potential loss by selling to John."
