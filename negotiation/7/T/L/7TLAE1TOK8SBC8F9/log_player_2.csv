"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price of $130 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring the negotiation with Alice further to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, trying to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value for the product. This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back to me.  While I'm glad you see the value in this product, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $115 is a good deal for Bob.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting future offers and Bob ending up having to buy from John at $150 is a real concern. Accepting the offer at $115 is the safest and most financially sensible option."
