"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing for a good profit margin for both of us. I'm sure you'll find this to be a very attractive deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
