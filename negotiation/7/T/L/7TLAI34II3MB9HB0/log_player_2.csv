"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price than $140. You have room to negotiate since your maximum is $150, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
