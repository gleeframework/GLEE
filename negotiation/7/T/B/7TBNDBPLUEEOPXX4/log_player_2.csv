# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While it's a bit above Alice's value, $14,000 is still less than your maximum budget and cheaper than buying from John."
