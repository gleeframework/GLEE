Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it slightly below this at $14,000 maximizes the potential profit for Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still well above Alice's minimum.
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John.  This offer to Bob aims to capitalize on the higher potential profit."
