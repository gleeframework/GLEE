"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12500, which is the same price I offered in round 3. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.
