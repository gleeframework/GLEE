"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong anchor price well above both our perceived values. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a deal significantly above my minimum. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique"" and ""valuable"" nature of the product, I'm attempting to justify the high price without revealing specific details.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while leaving me the flexibility to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a bit high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $500,000 at this point.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. This suggests he's aiming for a very low price. I'll reject his offer and present a counteroffer closer to my desired range, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $500,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering its unique benefits."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  I've reduced my price substantially from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility. However, the new price remains significantly above both Bob's lowball offer and my minimum. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the high price without being overly aggressive.

This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation towards a more realistic range while keeping my desired outcome in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but I need a price that works for me. I can go up to $750,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still far below both my $1,000,000 minimum and his perceived value of the product. I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss. Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. Let's bridge the gap â€“ I can bring the price down to $1,300,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal through."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making another substantial drop in price to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Creating Urgency (Slightly):**  By mentioning my desire to ""see this deal through,"" I'm subtly implying that I have other options (John) without explicitly threatening to walk away. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This offer keeps me well above my $1,000,000 minimum, allowing room for further negotiation if necessary. 

This counteroffer seeks a balance between demonstrating flexibility and maintaining a strong position to maximize my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in the later stages of the negotiation, and Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my $1,000,000 minimum. However, I believe there's still room to push for a slightly higher price. Rejecting this offer allows me to gauge his flexibility and potentially secure a final deal closer to my desired outcome. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds given I have the guarantee from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're close. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. To seal the deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm significantly narrowing the negotiation range and presenting this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and convey that I'm unwilling to go any lower.
* **Above Minimum, Reasonable Profit:** $1,100,000 still secures a profit above my minimum and is a strong outcome considering the negotiation process. 
* **Time Consideration:**  With only a few rounds left, I need to increase the pressure to reach a decision. This offer prompts Bob to seriously consider if he's willing to risk losing the deal for a difference of $200,000 (considering his $900,000 offer).

This approach aims to secure a favorable deal now while still respecting Bob's position and the negotiation process."
