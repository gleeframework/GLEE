Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $100 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You want at least $120, so this offer leaves space for you to potentially get a better price.

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  See if Bob is willing to negotiate at all.
* **Set a good starting point:**  Establish a price range for the negotiations.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  If Bob doesn't accept, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum price of $120. It's worth trying to push for a higher price, especially since you have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
``` 

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Be reasonable:**  It's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still be above your minimum:**  $92.50 is significantly higher than your minimum of $120, giving you some room to negotiate further.
* **Express your willingness to continue:**  The message emphasizes that you're open to finding a solution that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $91? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $91 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the $120 you can get from John. It's not worth risking a further drop in price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price and avoids further time spent negotiating."
