"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's value. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By phrasing it as ""settling,"" I project a willingness to negotiate fairly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer gives Alice the opportunity to counter back, potentially reaching a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above our target. We're getting closer to John's price, but there's still room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm aiming closer to $80, could you meet me at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between her last offer ($95) and my previous counteroffer ($85). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Anchoring to $80:**  By mentioning my target price of $80, I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** I continue to use polite language to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage further offers from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to go any higher than that. I think $110 is a fair price for this product. It's worth a lot more to me than that, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is too big of a jump from her previous offer and is getting too close to John's price of $120. It seems unlikely she's willing to negotiate down to a price that would make it worthwhile for me to continue the negotiation. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
