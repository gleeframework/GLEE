``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and it also shows I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $5,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but he's still not quite there. I'm not willing to risk going through more rounds of negotiation with the risk of him backing out completely. John is a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so it's better to cut my losses and sell to him."
