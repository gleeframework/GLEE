"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Space for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $140, it allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I have to consider selling to John. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay more than my minimum. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to explore if I can get closer to my initial target.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 10 rounds, I need to be strategic and not rush into a deal too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's split the difference. How about $135? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  By offering $135, I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise. This is a good tactic to get closer to a deal.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $135 is still above my minimum of $120, making this a favorable outcome for me.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $130 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence Pays Off:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. It's too early to give up on a better price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the pressure on him and signal that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  With only a few rounds remaining, there's still a chance Bob might budge. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about we settle on $133? It's just a small adjustment from my last offer, and it gets us both closer to what we want. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 133} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  Offering $133 is a small concession from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still not giving in completely.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid a stalemate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use language like ""middle ground"" and ""closer to what we want"" to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and mutual benefit.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 5 rounds left, I need to be strategic and start inching towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $132? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to our last few rounds, and the risk of selling to John at a lower price increases. 
* **Close to Desired Price:**  $132 is only $3 away from my initial target of $135 and significantly better than selling to John for $120. 
* **Mutual Compromise:**  Bob has also shown willingness to compromise, and accepting his offer signifies a fair deal for both of us.

This feels like a good point to close the deal and secure a decent profit."
