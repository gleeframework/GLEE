"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit below the minimum I'm willing to consider. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $820000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $820000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $780000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $780000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $810000. It's a bit above your budget, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $810000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stick with my previous offer of $780000. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I'm starting to think about buying from John for $1200000 if we can't come to an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,6,
