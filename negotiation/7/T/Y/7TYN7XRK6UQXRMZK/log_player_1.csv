Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stated, hinting at the product's value and Bob's potential benefit can help justify the higher price. 
* **Alternative:**  Knowing John is a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. This allows Alice to be more ambitious with her initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Bob's response will determine how Alice proceeds. She can always negotiate down, but it's harder to negotiate up."
