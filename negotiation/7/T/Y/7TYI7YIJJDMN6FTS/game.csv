"Alice,  $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only able to offer $850000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
