"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, this product represents a significant investment on my part, and $750,000 undervalues its true potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's worth while still offering you substantial value.",925000.0,Alice,3,
