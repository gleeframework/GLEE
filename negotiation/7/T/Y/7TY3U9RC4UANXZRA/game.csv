"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $125 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. ",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $100, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, though. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than your budget, but I think it's a fair compromise.",115.0,Alice,5,
