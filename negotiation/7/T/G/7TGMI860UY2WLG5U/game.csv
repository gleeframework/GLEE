"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this work.  This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value to both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
