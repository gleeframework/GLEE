Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a point where negotiations with Bob aren't yielding a price I'm comfortable with, and I'm running out of rounds.  While selling to John means I'm getting a lower price than I'd like, it's still above my minimum and guarantees me a sale."
