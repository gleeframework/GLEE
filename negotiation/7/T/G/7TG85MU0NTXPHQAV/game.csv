"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $9,200 is still too low. Let's split the difference again and try $9,350. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us to close the deal.",9350.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. How about we try $9,150?",9150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be budget conscious, but $9,150 is simply not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle again and go with $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point. If we don't come to an agreement, I may have to consider other offers.",9250.0,Alice,7,
