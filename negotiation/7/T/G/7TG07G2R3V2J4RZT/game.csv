,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's still a great product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would still be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $92.50? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $87.50. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for this product.",87.5,Bob,6,
