{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering $100, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves space for counteroffers without immediately triggering a deal with John.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the value for Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept.

**This strategy balances the need to get a good price with the risk of Bob rejecting and potentially triggering a deal with John.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's still a great product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my value, potentially leading to a better deal.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John at $120 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to potentially get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would still be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on finding a fair price for both parties, making it less confrontational.
* **Strategic Price:** $95 is a good midpoint that leaves room for potential negotiation in the next round if needed. 

This approach aims to find common ground while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially getting closer to my target.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John at $120 is secure, another round of negotiation presents the possibility of a better deal, even if it carries a slight risk. 

This strategy balances the need for a good price with the risk of losing the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $92.50? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($95) and Bob's current offer ($90). 
* **Approaching Minimum:**  $92.50 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, making it a more appealing option than selling to John immediately.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights fairness and mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to see the value in accepting.

**This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is closer to my desired price while still leaving room for potential negotiation.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $87.50. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $87.50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  Another round of negotiation is unlikely to yield a substantially better price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John at $120 guarantees a good return, and further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.

**This strategy prioritizes securing a good price with minimal risk, rather than pursuing potentially lower offers from Bob.**"
