"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price is fair, given its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This considers the value it holds for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
