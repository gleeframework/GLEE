"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Even though Alice claims it's a great price for you, $12,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. Alice is motivated to sell, as she values the product at $15,000. 
* **Safe alternative:** You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $8,000, so there's no pressure to accept an unreasonable offer. 

**Next Steps:** You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she has lowered her price, $10,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate further. Alice is clearly willing to lower her price, demonstrating a desire to close the deal.
* **Safe alternative:** You still have the guaranteed option of buying from John at $8,000, so there's no rush to accept a price that doesn't meet your needs.

**Next Steps:** You should continue negotiating with Alice by making another counteroffer, trying to get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me is $15,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.
