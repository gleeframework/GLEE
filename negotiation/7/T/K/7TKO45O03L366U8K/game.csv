Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?,1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay up to $850000 for this product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $1200000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in moving forward with.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This would still represent a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in moving forward with.",925000.0,Alice,5,
