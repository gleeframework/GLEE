"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to ensure a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the purchase if we can meet on this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and commitment.  While I'm happy to work with you, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the sale, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and my original offer of $8,500. Would you consider $8,750 again? I'm willing to make a commitment to the purchase if we can meet on this price.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your commitment to this purchase.  To be honest,  $8,750 is simply too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. However, to make this final push towards a deal, I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. It's a small concession, but it demonstrates my commitment to finding common ground. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",8900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but no higher. I've already stretched my budget as far as I can. If we can meet on this price, I'm ready to move forward with the purchase.",8800.0,Bob,8,
