"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, as it's above your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly above your own valuation.  Let's try to close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",15500.0,Alice,5,
