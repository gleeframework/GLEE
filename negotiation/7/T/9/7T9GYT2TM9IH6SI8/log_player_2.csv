"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, given its unique value and potential. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I believe it's worth more than that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's budget.  Bob has a better option - he can buy the product from John for $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $9500 is still far from what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $12000 is my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than Bob's budget, and he's already made two counteroffers.  At this point, it's not clear that Alice is willing to come down to a price Bob is comfortable with. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John for $10,000."
