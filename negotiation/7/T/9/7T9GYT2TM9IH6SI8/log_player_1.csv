"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will try to negotiate with Bob to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I believe it's worth more than that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $14000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,500 is better than $8,000, it is still below my minimum threshold. I will continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $9,500 is still far from what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $12,000 is my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
