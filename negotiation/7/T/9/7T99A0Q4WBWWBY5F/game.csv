"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you working with me. However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $14,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $14,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. If you're serious about selling, I think this is a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
