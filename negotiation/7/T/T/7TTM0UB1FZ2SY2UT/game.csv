"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
