"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a starting price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. Let's compromise at $10,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
