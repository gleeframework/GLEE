Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $110? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much from her initial offers. At this point, we're risking entering a stalemate and wasting time. It's more advantageous to buy from John at $80, securing a reasonable price without further negotiation."
