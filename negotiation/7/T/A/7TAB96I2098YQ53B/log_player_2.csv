# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $950,000, which is lower than my budget. I will buy the product from John for $1,500,000 if Alice's offer is rejected.
