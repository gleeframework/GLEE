"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already made a significant concession by offering it for $10000, and now you're asking me to go down to $9500. I'm not comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $9750. This is my last compromise.",9750.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions already, and I'm starting to think we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll make one last offer: $9500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you've made concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $8800. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000.",8800.0,Bob,10,
