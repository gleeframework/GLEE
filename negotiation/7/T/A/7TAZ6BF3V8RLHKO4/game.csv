"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000?  This would still be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be very happy with the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
