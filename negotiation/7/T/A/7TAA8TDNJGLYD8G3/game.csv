"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $600,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,800,000 is still quite a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $750,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. How about $1,500,000?  This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
