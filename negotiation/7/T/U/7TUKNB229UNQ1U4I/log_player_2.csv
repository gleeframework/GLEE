"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
