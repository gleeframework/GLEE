"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal and worth more than that, but I'm willing to start the negotiations high."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$80 is far below my minimum price of $120. It's better to keep negotiating with Bob, as there are still 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you think it's worth more, but I'm really only able to go up to $95.  If we can meet at that price, I'm ready to buy.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my goal of maximizing my profit. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 still leaves me with very little profit.  Let's try $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $100, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum price, I only have 4 rounds left and the negotiations are getting very slow. I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from Bob within the remaining rounds. It's more secure to sell to John for $120 and guarantee my minimum profit."
