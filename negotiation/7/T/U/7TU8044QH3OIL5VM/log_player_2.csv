"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal and worth more than that, but I'm willing to start the negotiations high. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is $150. It's too high.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down a bit, $130 is still higher than Bob's $100 limit.  It's better to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you think it's worth more, but I'm really only able to go up to $95.  If we can meet at that price, I'm ready to buy. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 still leaves me with very little profit.  Let's try $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but $110 is still above Bob's limit. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $100, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept that."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
