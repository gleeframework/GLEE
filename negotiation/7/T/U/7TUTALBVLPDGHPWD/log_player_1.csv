"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving me a decent starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, but it's getting closer. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 130}
