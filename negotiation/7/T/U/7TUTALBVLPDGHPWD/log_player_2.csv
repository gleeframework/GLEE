"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. Since we only have 10 rounds and I'm not sure if I can get her any lower, I'll accept the offer to secure the product and avoid the risk of losing it to another buyer."
