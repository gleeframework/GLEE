"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is within your budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's value for the product. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still potentially saving you money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product. You can likely push for a lower price with a counteroffer. There's still some room for negotiation, and you want to maximize your savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'm still a little high, though.  How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your initial offer, showing Alice you're willing to meet her halfway, but still lower than her most recent offer. This shows you're serious about buying the product but also looking for the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $137.50? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $137.50 is still more than what you're willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  Since you're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation rounds, it's important to continue to strive for a better deal.  However, you also need to be aware of the risk of reaching the 10th round and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. I'm still a bit above my budget at $137.50. How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move. It shows Alice you're willing to compromise while also staying within your budget. You're proposing a price that's very close to her last offer, making it more likely she'll accept. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping you within your price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $132.50 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $135? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is just above your initial counteroffer and within your budget. It's likely that if you reject and make another counteroffer, Alice might not budge further.  With only three rounds left, you risk having to buy from John at $150. Accepting this offer allows you to get the product while still saving some money compared to John's price."
