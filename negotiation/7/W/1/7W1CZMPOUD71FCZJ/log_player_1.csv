Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value, leaving room for potential concessions. It is important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so starting high allows for a more profitable outcome if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum value. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's also higher than what I would get from John. It's time to accept the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
