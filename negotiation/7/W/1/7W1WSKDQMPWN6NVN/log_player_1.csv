Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm aiming for a significant profit, but I'm also aware that Bob might be willing to pay more than the minimum $1,000,000 I need.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can explore counteroffers and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,200,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to make a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good profit margin. I don't want to risk further negotiation and losing a potential sale, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
