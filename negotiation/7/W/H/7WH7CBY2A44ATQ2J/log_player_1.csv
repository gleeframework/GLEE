Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.  It also subtly highlights the value of the product without revealing my absolute minimum.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, great! If not, it allows me to see how much he's willing to negotiate.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** Starting high gives me flexibility to adjust the price downwards while still achieving a satisfactory profit. 
* **Keep John as a backup:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than John's offer, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $120. My goal is to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $110 is a compromise between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100. It's still a good profit for me and shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and acknowledges Bob's counteroffer. It reinforces the value of the product while presenting the compromise price as a fair solution.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** By meeting Bob halfway, I demonstrate that I'm serious about selling to him.
* **Maintain a good profit margin:** $110 is still significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, ensuring I make a decent profit. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By responding quickly, I avoid losing Bob's interest and keep the process moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $105 is a reasonable offer. It's above my minimum price of $80 and represents a good profit. Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely to yield a significantly higher price, and I risk losing Bob's interest. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting the offer at this point minimizes the risk of losing the sale and ensures a satisfactory profit."
