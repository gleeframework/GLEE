"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  That's a very strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal now.",800000.0,Bob,6,
