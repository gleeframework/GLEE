"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10500 is a bit below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recover a decent amount. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
