"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can do better than $11,500.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. It's a great product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10500 is a bit below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recover a decent amount. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is a good deal for him, as it's lower than John's price and still gives Alice a reasonable profit. There's no guarantee he can negotiate lower, and further rounds risk him losing the deal altogether."
