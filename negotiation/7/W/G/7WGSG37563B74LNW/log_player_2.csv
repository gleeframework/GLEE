"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is the minimum price you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my budget. However, her willingness to negotiate suggests there's room for a better deal.  I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product with your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, her final offer of $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  At this point, it's more efficient to simply buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation. I've already saved $200,000 compared to Alice's original offer, and the potential for further savings is diminishing."
