"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is the minimum price you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting from the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product with your budget constraints.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
