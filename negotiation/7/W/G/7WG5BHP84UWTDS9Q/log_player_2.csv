"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $14,000. Alice values the product at $12,000, meaning there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering $13,000, which is still a good deal for him, as he is willing to pay up to $15,000.  This counteroffer is also reasonable for Alice, as it is above her value of $12,000. This is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is within Bob's budget of $15,000. While it is not the ideal price, it is significantly better than buying from John for $15,000. It's also likely that further negotiation will not yield a much lower price, especially since Alice already rejected a $13,000 counteroffer."
