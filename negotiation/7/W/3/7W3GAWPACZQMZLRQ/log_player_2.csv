While $925,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll try to make another counteroffer."

While $915,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to save more. I'll try one more counteroffer before potentially going to John."

Alice has been firm and made a final offer. It's a better price than John's, and it seems like Alice is not willing to budge further.  It's worth accepting her final offer to secure the product."
