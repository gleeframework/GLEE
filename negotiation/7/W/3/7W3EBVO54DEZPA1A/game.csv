"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you thinking of my needs.  While I do see the value in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to be a bit flexible, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value you'll be getting.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I really appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm still a little over budget at $11,000.  Would you consider $10,750?  It's closer to what I can afford, and it's a fair price that splits the difference.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground here.  While I'm motivated to sell, I have to be firm on my price.  Would you be willing to do $10,900? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",10900.0,Alice,5,
