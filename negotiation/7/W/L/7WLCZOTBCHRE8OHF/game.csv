"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This reflects a fair price considering both our needs. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I have to consider my own needs and the value I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $875,000.  This would allow both of us to walk away happy and secure a mutually beneficial deal. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
