"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I agree it has potential, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I could go up to $1,100,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
