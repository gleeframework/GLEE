Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to let go of the product for $1,600,000. This offer stands, but I'm afraid I can't go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $1,600,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 and avoid potentially overpaying."
