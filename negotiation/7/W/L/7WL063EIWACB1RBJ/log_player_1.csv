Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $17,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $13,000 is below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making progress towards a price we can agree on. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $15,500 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $14,750 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $15,000.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I'm not confident I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob in that time.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to secure my minimum value and avoid any further negotiation risk."
