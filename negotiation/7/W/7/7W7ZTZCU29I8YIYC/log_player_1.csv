Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so any price below that gives him a gain.
* **My Minimum:** I have a minimum price of $10,000, as that's what I'd get from John.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $11,500, I'm leaving room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter with a lower offer, but I'm still getting more than my minimum.

This approach aims to maximize my profit while keeping the offer appealing enough for Bob to consider."
