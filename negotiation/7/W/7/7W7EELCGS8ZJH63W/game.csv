"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save even more. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save even more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
