"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference at $9,250? It's closer to your offer, but still gives me some room to breathe. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,250, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'd like to offer $9,100.  It's just a small difference, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",9100.0,Bob,6,
