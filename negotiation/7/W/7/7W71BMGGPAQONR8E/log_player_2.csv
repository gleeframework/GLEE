Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my understanding of the product's potential necessitates a higher figure.  I could consider $1,150,000.  This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While $1,150,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate further and get a price closer to your goal."
