Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (John's offer). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,200,000 gives Bob a substantial discount while still earning you a significant profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Deal:** The attractive price increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
2. **Maximize Earnings:**  $1,200,000 is considerably higher than your backup offer of $800,000. 

By starting with a strong but not overly aggressive offer, you leave room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome."
