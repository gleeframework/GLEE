Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's start with $1,250,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low.  This product is worth significantly more to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to gain from this transaction.  What do you say?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,310,000?
