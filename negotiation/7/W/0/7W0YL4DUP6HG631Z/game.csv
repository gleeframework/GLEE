"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and highly valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1500000 for this exceptional item. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. It's a fair price considering the unique features and benefits this product offers. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about being above budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1050000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're at an impasse, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $1050000. I'm going to make one last attempt to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer.",1150000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sorry we couldn't come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one last offer of $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
