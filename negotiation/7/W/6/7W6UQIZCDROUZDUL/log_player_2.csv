Round 2

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,700 is closer to your desired price, but still higher than your initial counteroffer of $8,500. A counteroffer of $9,000 splits the difference, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your target."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is a good price, considering your maximum budget is $10,000. While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to budge and you might end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a higher price or negotiation breakdown."
