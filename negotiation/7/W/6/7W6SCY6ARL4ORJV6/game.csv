"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $950,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $975,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement if we keep working towards the middle.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify.  Let's try $960,000.  We've both moved closer to each other, and I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us.  What do you think?",960000.0,Bob,6,
