Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $120 but leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $150, he may be willing to pay a bit more than $140 to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept it, it's below your minimum price of $120.  It's better to continue negotiating with Bob or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's still a great deal for you, considering how much you value this product."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $110 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is your minimum price.  It's the best deal you can get from Bob, and you'll make a profit. There's no reason to keep negotiating or sell to John for the same price."
