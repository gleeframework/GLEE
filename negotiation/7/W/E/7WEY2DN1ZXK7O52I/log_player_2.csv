"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $8,000 for the product and John is willing to sell it to you for that price, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer. By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain the option of buying from John at the same price."
