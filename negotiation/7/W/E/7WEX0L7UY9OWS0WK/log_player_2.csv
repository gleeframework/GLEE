"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. I believe it would greatly benefit you based on its value. I am offering it to you for $120, which is a special deal considering its true worth of $150. I hope you find this offer attractive and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The offer from Alice is too high, and you can get the same product from John for $80. It is better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to make a counteroffer at $95 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the product's value and your budget. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $80, it's more advantageous to buy from him."
