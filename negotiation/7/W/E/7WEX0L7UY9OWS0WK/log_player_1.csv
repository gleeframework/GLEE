Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
