"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strong starting point and gives me room to negotiate. It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John's offer, so I'm not afraid to risk losing this deal if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for $7,500. I have more rounds left and can potentially get a better price from Bob, or I can still sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer.  I want to show I'm flexible, but I'm also holding firm on my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get him to go higher. I've reached the halfway point and there's no guarantee I can get a better price with the remaining rounds. It's time to be practical and secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
