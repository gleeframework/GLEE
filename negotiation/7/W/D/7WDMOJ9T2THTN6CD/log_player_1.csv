Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a lower price than my initial offer but higher than Bob's to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is higher than my minimum of $8,000, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer. It's a good compromise, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
