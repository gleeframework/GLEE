"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Considering its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is lower than the price you'd pay from John ($1,500,000). 
* This means accepting Alice's offer saves you $250,000.
* Even though the product is worth less to Alice ($800,000), you still benefit from the lower price."
