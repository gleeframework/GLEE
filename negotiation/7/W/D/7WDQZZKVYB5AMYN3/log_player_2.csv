You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and $8,000 to me.  I can get it from John for $8,000, so I should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I should try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
