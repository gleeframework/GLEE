"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my target price of $1,200,000.  It's too risky to accept at this point. I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a reasonable offer. How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still slightly higher. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal. There's still a chance to secure the product for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep.  Given my budget constraints, I can only offer $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your seriousness about this product and I value that. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is very close to my target price of $1,200,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product.  It's unlikely I'll get a lower price, especially since Alice has stated it's her final offer.  This also saves me from the risk of losing out on the product or having to buy from John for $1,200,000."
