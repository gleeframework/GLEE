Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer.  While unlikely, he might offer $110 or $120, which is still more profitable than selling to John.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides a safety net. You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
