"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,250 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is the absolute maximum I can pay. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,4,
