Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price point.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and moving closer to our desired price. It's worth another counteroffer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,220,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value this product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, his counteroffer didn't meet us in the middle. We have time to push a little further and are still well above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're close to an agreement. I'm willing to consider your perspective, but I need to see some movement on your end as well. To be fair, I'd be willing to accept $1,250,000 for the product.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** We're holding firm at a price point that's still a significant gain above John's offer.
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating it's our final offer, we encourage Bob to make a decision and potentially avoid further back-and-forth. 
* **Meeting halfway:**  We are splitting the difference between our last offer and his last offer, demonstrating fairness."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,225,000.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable deal:** $1,225,000 is a significant profit margin, exceeding our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now guarantees a very good outcome. 
* **Time Investment:** We've already spent considerable time negotiating. Accepting a strong offer now frees us up for other potential deals."
