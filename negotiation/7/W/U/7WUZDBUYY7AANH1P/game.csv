"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I recognize the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can reach a more agreeable price point. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. Would you consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
