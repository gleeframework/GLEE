Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $10,000. However, I believe I can still get closer to my asking price. There are more rounds, and I want to explore the negotiation further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $8,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to land somewhere closer to my $9,500 price.  I'm not yet ready to settle for $8,500, especially since I know I can get $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal happen.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm going to make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired $9,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not ready to settle for a price significantly lower than what I feel the product is worth."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're coming up a little.  I appreciate that. However, $8,750 is still just a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop to $8,875. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8875}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to pay $8,750, but I was thinking maybe we could meet even closer to my budget.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm appreciating your efforts to reach a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,625.  I'm willing to come down to $8,700 as a final offer.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $8,700, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, but I'm at a maximum of $8,600. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John.

(2) Reject Bob's offer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, and Bob's offer still below my desired price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Selling to John for $10,000 is the best option at this point. It guarantees me my minimum price, and I can avoid any further potential losses in the negotiation."
