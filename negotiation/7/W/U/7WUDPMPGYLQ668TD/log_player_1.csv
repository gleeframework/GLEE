(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that surpasses what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean losing out on potential profit. It's time to cut negotiations short and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
