"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000.  This would still allow for a good profit for you and would be a very fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider given the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
