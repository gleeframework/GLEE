"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There is room for negotiation since Alice's offer is above her minimum value of $1,200,000.  
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You have a safety net with John's offer, but it's still more expensive than what you'd like to pay.

By rejecting the offer, you can try to lower the price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000.  This would still allow for a good profit for you and would be a very fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** The counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:** The message emphasizes that the price is fair for both parties, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Keeps John's offer as a backup:** This offer is still cheaper than John's, leaving you with a viable alternative if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider given the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:**  Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise,  splitting the difference between your previous offer and her previous offer. 
* **Within your budget:** This price is within your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Saves you money:** It's significantly less than John's offer.

While you could continue negotiating, accepting this offer gets you the product for a good price and avoids the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a higher price or Alice walking away."
