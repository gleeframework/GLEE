"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:** I want to maximize my profit.
* **It's not unreasonable:**  I'm not being greedy, and it gives Bob room to negotiate. 
* **It sets a baseline:**  It gives Bob a clear understanding of my expectations.

I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not risking too much by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more. 

I'm choosing to proceed to the next round and counteroffer because:

* **I have the option to sell to John:** This gives me leverage.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is my minimum, meaning there's potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **I can explore his budget:**  I can use the negotiation to gauge his willingness to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000.  This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for profit while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay.

Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting halfway:**  My initial offer was $10,000, and Bob's offer was $8,000.  This compromise is closer to my desired price.
* **Testing the waters:**  This will give me insight into whether Bob is willing to pay closer to my initial price. 
* **Keeping options open:**  If he rejects, I can either counteroffer again or sell to John."
