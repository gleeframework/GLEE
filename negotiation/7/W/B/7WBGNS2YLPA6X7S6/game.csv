"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for a more reasonable price, closer to  $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,550,000. This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your initial interest.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but $1,550,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. How about we settle this right now at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
