Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,550,000. This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your initial interest.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. How about we settle this right now at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but she's still trying to get more than your absolute maximum budget of $800,000.  She's also introduced a sense of urgency with the ""other interested buyer"" tactic.  You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, so it's time to cut your losses and secure the product."
