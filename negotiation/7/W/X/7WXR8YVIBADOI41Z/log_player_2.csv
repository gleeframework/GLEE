"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $12,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with her, as she seems to be starting with a very high price. It's better to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, or consider buying from John if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. I'm confident we can reach a deal if you're willing to be flexible. "", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I believe the product's value to you justifies this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. It's not a good deal for me, but it's a sign she's willing to negotiate. I'll reject her offer and continue to try to get a better price. I'm confident I can get her down closer to my target price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  It allows you to make a decent profit while still being within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $15,500. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. While she's shown a willingness to negotiate, we're getting closer to the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's too high.  John is offering a price that's within my budget, and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
