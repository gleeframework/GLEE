"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. I'm confident we can reach a deal if you're willing to be flexible. ",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I believe the product's value to you justifies this price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  It allows you to make a decent profit while still being within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $15,500. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
