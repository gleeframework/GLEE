"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price for a product that's worth so much to both of us.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair price that's closer to both our desired numbers.",12500.0,Bob,4,
