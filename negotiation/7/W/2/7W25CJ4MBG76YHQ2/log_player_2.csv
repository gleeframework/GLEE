"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000). Bob can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.  

Here's the breakdown:

* **Buying from Alice:** Costs $1,400,000.
* **Buying from John:** Costs $1,500,000.

Even though buying from John is the most expensive, it's still more beneficial to Bob than accepting Alice's offer."
