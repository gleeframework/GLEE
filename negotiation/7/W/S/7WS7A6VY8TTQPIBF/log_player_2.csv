Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a slight discount, bringing the price down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,050,000. While closer to your goal, you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000. It makes the most financial sense to secure the product at the guaranteed lower price."
