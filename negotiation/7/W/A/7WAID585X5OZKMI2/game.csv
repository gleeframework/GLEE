"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I'm confident this price reflects a more accurate value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can do $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, the $700,000 offer is still too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
