"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while also being fair to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 still falls short of my minimum requirement. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer.  Let's close this deal. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to pursue other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to reduce the price, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",800000.0,Bob,6,
