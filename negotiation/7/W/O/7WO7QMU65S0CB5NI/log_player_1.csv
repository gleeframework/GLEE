Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You need to find a price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 that maximizes your profit while being enticing to Bob.

**Offer Strategy**

Aim high, but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Consider these factors:

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is prone to negotiation, start higher. If he's more straightforward, a smaller margin might be better. 
* **Perceived Value:** Can you emphasize aspects of the product that might make it worth more to Bob than he initially realizes?

**Example Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're expressing enthusiasm and positioning the product as valuable.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  The $1,400,000 is significantly above Bob's valuation but leaves you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to Discussion:** You're inviting Bob to engage in the conversation, making him feel more in control. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. The optimal offer depends on your assessment of Bob and the specific context of the negotiation."
