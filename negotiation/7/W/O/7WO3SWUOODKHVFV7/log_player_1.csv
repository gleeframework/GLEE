Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it'd be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($120), giving him room to negotiate.**
* **It's lower than your minimum price ($150), leaving some room for you to make concessions.**
* **It's a round number, making it easier for Bob to process.**

By starting with a slightly higher price, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially push for a higher price. If he rejects, I can make a counteroffer or choose to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $125 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm aiming to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still being above my minimum price, giving Bob some room to negotiate without dropping below my floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  It's likely that further negotiation will be more time-consuming and might not yield a significantly higher price.  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale."
