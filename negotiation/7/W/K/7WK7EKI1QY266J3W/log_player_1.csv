"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial position and gives me room to negotiate downwards.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still not where I want to be. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation if necessary. I'm hoping to get close to my desired price without pushing Bob away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not ready to sell for $850,000.  While it's close to my minimum, I have more rounds to try and get closer to $900,000. I'm going to counter and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and counteroffer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the back and forth we've had. Hopefully, this will be the final price point and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is offering my minimum price, but I've only got 4 rounds left. This is a risky gamble, and if I continue negotiating I might lose the chance to sell to John. It's time to cut my losses and secure the sale with John for $800,000."
