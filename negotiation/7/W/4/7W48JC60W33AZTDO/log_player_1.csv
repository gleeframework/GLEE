Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $13,500, which is $14,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750.

While $14,750 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price. I'm confident I can reach a better deal by countering again. There are still a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for less than I deserve."
