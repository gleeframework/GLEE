"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to me is $1,200,000. I would like to propose a price closer to that value. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to purchase at a lower price, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
