"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000.  It's a premium item worth a great deal to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value in the current market.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making compromises, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $750,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I can sense we're nearing a deal.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000.  This is a strong offer, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $775,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal, Bob.",825000.0,Alice,7,
