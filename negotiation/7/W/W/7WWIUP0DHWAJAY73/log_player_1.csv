"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me a good margin while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm lowering my price to $150. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still maintains a good profit for me. If Bob accepts, great. If he rejects, I can reassess and try a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is still a good deal.  I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with $120 from John.  It's better to secure a profit now than to gamble on a higher price later."
