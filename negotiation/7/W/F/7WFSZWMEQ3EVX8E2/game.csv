"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a fair price considering its value and rarity, and I think it's a good compromise.
