I'll reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a higher price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can push for a higher price."

I've had enough of this back and forth with Bob. He's not willing to meet my minimum price, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's better to sell to John for $8,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob."
