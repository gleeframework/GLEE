"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum value of $100.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction to see if he's willing to negotiate or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than $100, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to see if I can push for something closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that Bob finds appealing while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a little bit more.  I'm willing to keep negotiating for another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130. This is another compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping this will be the price point that closes the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's the same offer as last round, but given that we're approaching the middle of our negotiation rounds, I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.  $125 is a good profit for me, and I'm confident I can find another buyer if this deal falls through."
