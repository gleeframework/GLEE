"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for this product. I'm interested, but I can't justify paying that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that product is worth a significant sum to me, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's settle this now. How about $1,400,000? That's my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, which is a reasonable compromise. It's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to go with another seller.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
