Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also establishes a perceived high value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning that you'll list it publicly (and implying other interested buyers) could encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always negotiate down, but you cannot go lower than $15,000 as you have a guaranteed sale with John."
