"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a very good price, but it's still early in the negotiation. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, and I want to see if I can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This will test the waters and see how far she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my preferred price, but I still believe I can get it lower.  I'm not in a rush, and I want to see if I can push her further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my target.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my target price, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price, as I still have time and haven't reached my limit with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  I'm aiming for a price in the middle ground between her offer and my previous counteroffer.  This shows good faith while still trying to get a good deal.  If this offer is rejected, I'll need to seriously consider whether to accept her next offer or move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,750 is still above my ideal price, it's very close.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but I've reached a point where I'm concerned about running out of time. With only 3 rounds left, I'm likely to lose more money if I reject this offer and try for a lower price. It's a better deal than going to John, and I'm comfortable accepting it at this point."
