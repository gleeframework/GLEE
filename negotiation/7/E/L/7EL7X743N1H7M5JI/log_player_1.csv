"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" helps justify the high price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counter-offer. 
 
Let's see what Bob comes back with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is always an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  We'll aim to steer him closer to a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, your offer is significantly lower than its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, reflecting my desire to make this a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Rejecting:** We politely acknowledge Bob's offer but clearly state it's too low. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a substantial drop from the initial asking price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to move closer to our acceptable range.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  We reiterate the product's ""true value"" to shift Bob's focus away from his initial low offer.
* **Mutually Beneficial:** By framing it as a ""mutually beneficial"" deal, we imply there's a middle ground that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a middle ground here.  Your price is still far too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still far below your minimum and even his own perceived value. We're getting into the territory where continuing with Bob might not yield a significantly better result than selling to John. Let's apply some pressure in the next round to see if Bob is willing to make a serious offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm facing time constraints and have another interested buyer.  If we can't reach an agreement close to $1,300,000 in this round, I'll have to explore that other option."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're introducing a sense of urgency to incentivize Bob to make a more serious offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning John directly puts pressure on Bob by highlighting your viable alternative.
* **Slight Concession:**  We make another small concession to show we are still open to negotiation but hold firm to a price closer to our desired range.
* **Clear Condition:** By setting a specific price target for this round, we're pushing Bob to make a decision and show his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm serious about this purchase, but only within a reasonable price range. I can offer you $750,000 as a final offer.  If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has presented his ""final offer,"" and it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. He's also suggesting he'll walk away if you don't accept.  While he might be bluffing, it's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to a price you find acceptable.  

Here's why selling to John makes the most sense now:

* **Guaranteed Sale:** John provides a certain sale at your desired price.
* **Avoiding Further Risk:** Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, leaving you with a potentially longer negotiation process and no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The time spent negotiating with Bob could be used to find other potential buyers who might offer even more than John. 

While there's a chance you could squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth jeopardizing a sure thing with John."
