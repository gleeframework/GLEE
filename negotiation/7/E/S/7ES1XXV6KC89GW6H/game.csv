"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value you place on the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I have in the product, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to continue the negotiation.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our respective values and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  I'm confident that we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I have in the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering our previous discussions.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This price represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a reasonable price that reflects the value I have in the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to finalize the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
