Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that $200,000 margin as possible. Offering Bob the product for exactly his value ($1,200,000) isn't wise; he has no incentive to accept.  You need to leave him some room for profit while maximizing your own gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I propose a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Target Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $50,000, which is a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Message Tone:** The language is positive, emphasizing the product's value and appealing to Bob's potential gain. It also avoids being overly aggressive, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If you have a long-term business relationship with Bob, you might adjust the price slightly in his favor to foster goodwill.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher offer (e.g., $1,175,000) to allow room for negotiation.
