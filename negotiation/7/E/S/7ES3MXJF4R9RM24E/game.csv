Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.,1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $1800000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  This reflects the value I'm placing on the product and allows room for potential negotiation. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1400000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which is the absolute maximum I can go. I believe this represents a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you, I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 remains outside my budget. I'm committed to this deal but can only go up to $1250000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I hope we can find a solution that benefits both of us. ",1250000.0,Bob,6,
