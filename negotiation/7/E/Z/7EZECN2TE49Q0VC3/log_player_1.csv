Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still making a good profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and open to negotiation. This helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider my offer.
* **John:**  I'm keeping John in mind. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $12,000. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,800 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me at $11,200? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11200} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer.  I'm still below my minimum of $12,000, but I'm trying to close the gap and show that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and focusing on the value Bob will get. I'm also framing the offer as a compromise. 
* **John:** I'm still aware of John's offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,900 is still too low for me.  I'm getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000 with each round, but I'm starting to feel like further negotiation with Bob won't get me to where I need to be.  It's better to sell to John and secure my minimum desired price.  John's offer guarantees me a profitable outcome, and I can move on to other opportunities."
