{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a great deal for something of this value.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if it's just emphasizing the value) can make it more palatable to the buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message hints at potential flexibility (""willing to part with it for..."") and encourages Bob's input.

**Important Note:** While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more. This offer aims to test that possibility. If Bob rejects it, Alice has the safety net of John's offer."
