"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I believe this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $700,000. I'm willing to consider a price closer to the value it holds for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is already a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering the product for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to move a bit from my last offer. How about we agree on $825,000 and close this deal out?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering the product for $825,050. This is a very slight increase from my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",825050.0,Alice,7,
