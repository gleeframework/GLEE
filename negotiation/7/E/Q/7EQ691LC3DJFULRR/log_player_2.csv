Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $700,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000.

Alice is clearly very attached to that $825,000 mark. She's trying to meet in the middle, but only by tiny increments. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and this price is a great deal compared to John's offer.  Take the deal!"
