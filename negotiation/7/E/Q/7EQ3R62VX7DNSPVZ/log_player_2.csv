"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is not unreasonable, John is offering the product for $10,000, which is your maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to purchase the product for a lower price from John."
