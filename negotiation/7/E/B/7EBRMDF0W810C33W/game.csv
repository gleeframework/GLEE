"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, however, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a valuable asset for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than you can consider, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, which is closer to your original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,
