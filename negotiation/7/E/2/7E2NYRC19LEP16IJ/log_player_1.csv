Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  However, I'm keeping in mind my minimum price is $100, and I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a better price than what Bob initially offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum price of $100. While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I will sell to him."
