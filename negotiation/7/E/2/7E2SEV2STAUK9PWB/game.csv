,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is the highest I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $130. It's still a bit above your budget, but I think the product is worth it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",130.0,Alice,5,
