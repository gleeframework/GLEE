"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for more room to negotiate. It also signals that I believe the product is valuable. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware of John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I'll use this opportunity to try and get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. He's offered $1,600,000, which is higher than my minimum price of $1,500,000 and a good compromise.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll end up selling to John for the minimum price.  At this point, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit."
