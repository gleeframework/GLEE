"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $850,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me while allowing you to make a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.  The gap is closing, but it's not time to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair valuation."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but I'm not comfortable going above $900,000. I've really stretched my budget, and this is the absolute highest I can go. If you're serious about making a deal, I hope you'll consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's latest offer is significantly below my minimum, and his message suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.  John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 is now the better option to ensure I get a fair value for the product.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on."
