Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $9,000 is still below my minimum.
