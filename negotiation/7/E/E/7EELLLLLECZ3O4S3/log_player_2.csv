# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it holds for you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $12,000 is her absolute lowest price. Since your maximum price is $10,000 and you have the option to buy from John at that price, it's no longer beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice.  You'll get a better deal by going with John."
