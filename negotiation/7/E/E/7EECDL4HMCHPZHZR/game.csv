"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a good price point, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll receive.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to make a significant discount. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
