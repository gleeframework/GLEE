"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing it Positively:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing the offer as a ""great deal"".
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's room for Bob to counteroffer, giving us both an opportunity to come to an agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price over rounds, keeping in mind my minimum and Bob's potential value. I'll also pay attention to Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a loss for me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, giving Bob a chance to meet me halfway.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware that John is willing to buy the product for $1,500,000, so I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for compromise. This will help me gauge Bob's real willingness to pay and potentially reach a deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a good price point, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** I'm dropping my price to $1,600,000, which is closer to my minimum and leaves room for potential further negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value Bob will receive from the product to justify my price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay while keeping my minimum in mind. I'm aiming for a deal that is advantageous for me while acknowledging Bob's interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to make a significant discount. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are in Round 4, leaving only 6 rounds remaining. I don't want to risk losing too much time with further negotiation and potentially miss out on a good deal.
* **Potential for Loss:** While I can technically get a slightly higher price from John, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale. It also minimizes the risk of Bob backing out entirely or John's offer changing.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer in Round 4, as it provides a quick sale and a price that is close to my minimum acceptable value. This strategy prioritizes minimizing risk and securing a deal."
