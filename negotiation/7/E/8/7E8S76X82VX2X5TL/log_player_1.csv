Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to secure a sale with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below $12,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still ensuring a profit.
* **Polite and Open Approach:** The message aims to be collaborative and invites Bob to engage in a discussion about the price.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a successful sale."
