"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate with you. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,500 is still a little steep for me. Could we settle somewhere around $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,
