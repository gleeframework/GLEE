Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112. That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 112}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to be mindful of your budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob. It's better to sell to John and get at least my minimum price than risk losing out on a sale completely."
