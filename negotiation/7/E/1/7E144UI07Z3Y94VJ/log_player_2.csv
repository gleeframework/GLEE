"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above her value for the product ($1,000,000). As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is still a significant profit for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's still below my maximum price of $1,200,000 and gives me a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away or I'll end up paying more to John. Accepting this offer seems like the most sensible option."
