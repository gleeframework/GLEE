"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 matches Bob's maximum budget.  There's no advantage to rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate, as Bob wouldn't be able to get a lower price.  Furthermore, buying from John for the same price would be unnecessary.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
