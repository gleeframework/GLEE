"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're looking to save as much money as possible. 
* $1,150,000 is still too high for you, as you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's desired price of $1,000,000. 
* This shows good faith in the negotiation and leaves room for further bargaining.
* I still have a $500,000 buffer before reaching my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is still within my budget.
* While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer again, and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that's $100,000 lower than John's price, saving me money."
