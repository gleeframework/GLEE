{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer allows me to potentially earn a significant amount while still leaving room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling and willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal, I cannot accept a price that is significantly below what I know the product is worth to him. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still provides you with significant value and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and it seems he is serious about closing the deal. Accepting his offer is the best course of action, as I can secure a sale close to my desired price and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower amount."
