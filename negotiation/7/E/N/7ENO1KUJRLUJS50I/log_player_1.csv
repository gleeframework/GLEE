Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,060,000 is the maximum I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is inching closer to a reasonable price. We are still significantly above our minimum and have room to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. To demonstrate my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  **Strong stance:**  By stating this is our final offer, we signal firmness and encourage Bob to take the deal seriously. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a high price.
* **Time Pressure:**  As we progress through the rounds, the implied pressure of potentially losing the deal might push Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $1,050,000 is a significant profit above our minimum. Accepting ensures a substantial gain.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away, potentially leaving us with John's lower offer. Accepting now guarantees a good outcome.
* **Limited Rounds:** With fewer rounds remaining, the chance of Bob significantly increasing his offer diminishes. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him later."
