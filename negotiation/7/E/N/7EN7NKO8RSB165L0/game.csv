"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me though. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget is a concern, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
