"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While it's tempting to go with $12,000, I'm hoping I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $13,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,500 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget. I'm willing to go down to $14,000 for the product. This is the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm running out of time. Since I'm not confident I'll get a better offer from Bob, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal for me."
