"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with an offer of $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a good starting point, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  I need to try and bring the price down to be within my budget. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $1,200,000 gives me leverage to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,125,000.  This will still leave you plenty of room within your budget, and it's a significant step closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Alice has shown flexibility, and I believe I can still get the price lower. 
* **John's offer is still my backup:**  It's reassuring to know I have an alternative if negotiations fail."
