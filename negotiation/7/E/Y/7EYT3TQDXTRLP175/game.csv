"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. It's something that I value highly, at least $10,000, and I know you would find it equally valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I'm confident another buyer will be interested.",10500.0,Alice,1,
