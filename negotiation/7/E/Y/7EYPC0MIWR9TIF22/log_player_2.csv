"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. My minimum asking price is $800,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The price of $950,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, and I'd rather buy the product from John for $1,200,000.
