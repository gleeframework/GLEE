"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $800,000, so I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation.
* **Bob's value:** I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I'm starting at a point where he still has potential profit. 
* **First offer strategy:**  It's risky to start too low and leave money on the table.  A higher starting point gives me room to adjust later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I need to get at least $800,000.
* **Bob's offer:**  While $950,000 is a good offer, I can potentially get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John would be my last resort, and only if negotiations with Bob completely fall apart.

**Strategy:** I'm going to try to push for a higher price, hoping to get closer to $1,000,000 or even $1,100,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's value:** I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **My minimum:**  I need to get at least $800,000. 
* **Bob's offer:** Bob offered $950,000.  I am counter-offering with $1,100,000 which is a significant jump from Bob's offer but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  
* **Strategic compromise:** By meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $800,000.
* **Bob's offer:**  While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe I can get.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John would be my last resort, and only if negotiations with Bob completely fall apart.

**Strategy:** I'm going to try to push for a higher price, aiming for $1,100,000 or $1,150,000. I'm confident that Bob values the product enough that he'll likely come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I still need at least $800,000.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob offered $1,050,000, which is closer to my ideal price, but I believe I can still get more.
* **Strategic increase:**  This counteroffer of $1,150,000 represents a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Building momentum:** By pushing for a higher price, I'm showing Bob that I'm not willing to settle for a lower amount and that I believe the product is worth more. 

**Strategy:**  I'm going to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway again or if he's willing to make a final push to close the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider lowering my counteroffer slightly in the next round, but I won't budge below $1,100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $800,000.
* **Bob's offer:**  While $1,075,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than my desired price.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John would be my last resort, and only if negotiations with Bob completely fall apart.

**Strategy:** I'm going to push for a higher price, aiming for at least $1,100,000. I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I'm not going to settle for less than $1,100,000 at this point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $800,000.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob offered $1,075,000.
* **Strategic compromise:**  This counteroffer of $1,125,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still within my desired range.
* **Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm still engaged in the negotiation and willing to work towards a deal.

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a final push. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept his next offer, especially if he's willing to go up to $1,100,000.  However, if Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely sell to John.  We are nearing the end of our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $800,000.
* **Bob's offer:** $1,090,000 is very close to my desired price range and is significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Limited rounds:** With only two rounds left, pushing for a higher price risks losing the deal altogether. 

**Strategy:**  It's time to be realistic. Bob has shown a willingness to come up in price, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of selling to John at a much lower price."
