Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,100,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice. You maximize your savings by taking the guaranteed deal from John."
