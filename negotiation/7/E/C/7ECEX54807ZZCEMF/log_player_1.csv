"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $6,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $11,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we do $7,500?  That would be a good compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  Let's try $9,500.  This is a significant price drop and  a fair offer considering what I'm willing to part with it for."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to make a deal. How about $8,000 even?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has reached his maximum valuation at $8,000. Accepting this offer is better than risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer or having Bob walk away. It's also a better outcome than selling to John for $12,000 since we'll be closing the deal sooner."
