"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is my minimum. It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk a drawn-out negotiation or losing out to John."
