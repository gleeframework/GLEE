"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to purchase it at a lower price point. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to purchase the product at a lower price point, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
