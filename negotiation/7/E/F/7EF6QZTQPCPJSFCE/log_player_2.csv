Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to purchase the product at a lower price point, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000. Accepting this offer gets you the product for less than your maximum budget and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
