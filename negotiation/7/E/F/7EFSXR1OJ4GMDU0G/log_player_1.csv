"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum desired price of $120. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still staying above my minimum desired price of $120. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to counteroffer again to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still staying above my minimum desired price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to go above $107.  It's now Round 6, and I've already made multiple concessions.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $120, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
