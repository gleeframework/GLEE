"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,600,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you and it's a significant profit for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget and John is offering the product for less. It makes the most sense to buy from John in this scenario."
