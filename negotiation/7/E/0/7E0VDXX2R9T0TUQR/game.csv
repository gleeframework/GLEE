"Alice, $20,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. Could you consider a price closer to $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
