Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $130. "", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer closer to Bob's maximum valuation increases your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it allows space for Bob to negotiate or for you to slightly lower the price if needed, still staying well above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so you're not desperate and can afford to aim high with Bob."
