"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high.  $200 is well over my budget of $80.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $200 might have been a little high, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $140 is still too high for me. I'm comfortable buying from John for $80, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
