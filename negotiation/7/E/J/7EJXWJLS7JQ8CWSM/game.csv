"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $912,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $912,500 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to go back to $900,000, but I'd like to request some additional support or services to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to throw in some extras to make the deal more attractive?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the suggestion for additional support, but at this price point, I'm not able to offer anything extra. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.  How about $905,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal.",905000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $905,000 is the best price for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $885,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",885000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle once more. I'm willing to come down to $895,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",895000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I've decided to make one final offer. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,10,
