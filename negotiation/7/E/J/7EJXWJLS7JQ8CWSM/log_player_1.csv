Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $912,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 912500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $912,500 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to go back to $900,000, but I'd like to request some additional support or services to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to throw in some extras to make the deal more attractive?

We've reached the final round, and while $875,000 is a decent price, I'm not convinced I can get Bob to go higher.  It's better to secure the sale with John at $800,000 rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
