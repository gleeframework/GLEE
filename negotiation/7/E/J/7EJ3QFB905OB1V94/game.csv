"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm afraid $800000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and my budget. I'm starting to get close to my maximum budget, so I hope we can meet in the middle soon.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're getting close to your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is a relatively small concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle soon and finalize the deal.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $975000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to explore other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options, including buying the product from John for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
