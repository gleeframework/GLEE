"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
