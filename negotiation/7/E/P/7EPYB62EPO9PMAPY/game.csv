"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it can bring great value to your business. My initial offer is $1,100,000. Let's discuss further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. How about we start at $800,000 and see if we can find some middle ground?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is still below what I need. How about we try $900,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find a solution that works for us both.  I can go up a little, how about $875,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price. While $875,000 is a step in the right direction, I still need to reach a figure that reflects the true value of this product. How about we settle on $925,000? This price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $890,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both eager to finalize this deal, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the true value of this product. While I'm willing to compromise, $890,000 simply doesn't cut it. Let's meet halfway at $910,000. I believe this offer is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",910000.0,Alice,9,
