Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows for potential profit and also gives you a cushion in case Bob counteroffers.
* **The message is friendly and inviting:**  This encourages Bob to engage in a productive negotiation.

I'll be ready to respond to any counteroffers or continue negotiating with Bob until I reach a satisfactory price, or if necessary, I will move on to John and sell the product for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1,000,000. Would it be possible for you to adjust the price accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for a price well below its true value. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above Bob's offer:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Be realistic yet profitable:** This price is still within my minimum acceptable range and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Reiterate the value for Bob:**  I'm reminding him that even at this price, he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, it's getting close to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing this deal and potentially having to sell to John at $1,500,000, which would be a significant loss in potential profit for me. 

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
