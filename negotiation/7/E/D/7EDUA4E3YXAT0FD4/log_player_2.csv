"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate further and see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there at $1,400,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,375,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also fitting within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we settle on $1,390,000? It's a strong offer that reflects the true value of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,390,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,390,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,390,000 is a good price for you.  It's getting close to your ideal price point, and you've already rejected her last offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, especially since John is offering a higher price.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product while still saving a significant amount of money."
