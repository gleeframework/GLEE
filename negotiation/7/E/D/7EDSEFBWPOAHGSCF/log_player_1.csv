"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate while still being profitable. I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. I am willing to pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $95, which is still above my minimum price of $100 but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains some room for a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I am still interested in purchasing the product, but I am only able to offer $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $100.  Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and it's unlikely he'll go higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
