Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also factoring in Bob's potential value.  This offer leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to come close enough to my desired price. It's time to move on and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to make a higher profit, securing the guaranteed $15,000 is the best option at this point."
