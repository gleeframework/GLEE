Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $115.  This still gives you a good price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $107?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $107 is getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer. I'll accept his offer."
