{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum selling price. It leaves room for negotiation while demonstrating confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum selling price. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's more beneficial to sell to him at $150.  Further negotiation with Bob might result in a lower price or a prolonged process, potentially leading to a missed opportunity with John."
