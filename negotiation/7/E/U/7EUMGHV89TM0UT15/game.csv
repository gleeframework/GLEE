"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
