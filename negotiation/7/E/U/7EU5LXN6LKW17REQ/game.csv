"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  $7,200 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $7,800 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts.",7800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,800 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,200, as I mentioned before.
