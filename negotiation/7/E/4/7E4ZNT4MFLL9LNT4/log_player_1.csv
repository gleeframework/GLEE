Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,750,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a price significantly higher.  This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your backup plan.
* **Value Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" to make the higher price more palatable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and invites Bob to share his thoughts, signaling willingness to negotiate.

By aiming high initially, you maximize your chances of securing a better deal with Bob while having John as a safety net."
