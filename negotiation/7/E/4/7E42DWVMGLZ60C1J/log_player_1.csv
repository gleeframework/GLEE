{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below your minimum of $100. This allows for some wiggle room for negotiation while still leaving a profit margin for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price and your initial offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob before settling for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $85 is my final offer.  It's still a great deal for you, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $85 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it. "", ""product_price"": 80}
