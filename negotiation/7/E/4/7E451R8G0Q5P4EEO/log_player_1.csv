"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $14,500. This is a bit lower than my minimum price of $15,000, but it's still above Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This allows for room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I believe I can still get a better deal if I continue negotiating. I have 8 rounds left to make a better offer and am confident I can close the deal for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low.  I have 6 rounds remaining and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm still not happy with the idea of selling to John for $15,000 as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to continue to slowly lower my price, but only by a small amount.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but he's also not willing to go above a certain price. I'm hoping that by offering a price that's just slightly above his last offer, I can entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm choosing to sell to John.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation process and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a better price from Bob.  John is offering me my minimum price and I want to ensure I don't lose out on that deal."
