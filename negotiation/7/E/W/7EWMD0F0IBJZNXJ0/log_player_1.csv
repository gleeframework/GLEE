Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's estimated worth, leaving room for negotiation, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm also positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I need to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have 10 rounds to try and close a deal with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,500,000.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have 10 rounds to try and close a deal with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,275,000 is still quite far from what the product is truly worth. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,325,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my goal, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 4 rounds remaining. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have more rounds to try and close a deal with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence in finding a solution. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to drop my price just a little more to $1,310,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1310000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but no higher. I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options, including buying from John. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further, and I only have two rounds left.  While $1,300,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's getting risky to keep negotiating, and I don't want to lose out on the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John. I will sell to John to ensure I receive a price I am happy with."
