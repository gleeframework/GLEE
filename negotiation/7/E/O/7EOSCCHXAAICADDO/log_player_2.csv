"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to $9,500 to make this work.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is closer to your goal, you can still try to negotiate further to get closer to your ideal price of $8,000.  There's still some room for both of you to compromise."
