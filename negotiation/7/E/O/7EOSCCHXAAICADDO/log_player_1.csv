{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is higher than what Bob believes the product is worth, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It leaves room for negotiation without sacrificing your minimum desired profit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, allowing for a more amicable negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to go down to $8,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a considerable loss for you. It's better to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to $9,500 to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a significant profit loss.
* **Reasonable increase:**  The $9,500 price point is a reasonable increase from Bob's offer, suggesting you're open to compromise without drastically lowering your expectations.
* **Maintaining value:**  This offer still allows for a decent profit margin while remaining within the realm of what Bob might be willing to pay, given his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to move forward with the purchase. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $9,000 is only $3,000 below your minimum desired price of $12,000. While it's not ideal, it's a significant improvement from Bob's previous offers.
* **Risk of losing Jhon:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to him rejecting your offer again. This could ultimately force you to sell to Jhon for $12,000, which is a potential loss.
* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting Bob's offer now might open the door for future collaborations.  

Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer of $9,000 seems like the most reasonable choice. You can still secure a decent profit while avoiding the risk of losing out on the deal entirely."
