"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to go down to $8,500. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to $9,500 to make this work.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to move forward with the purchase. Let's see if we can agree on this.",9000.0,Bob,4,
