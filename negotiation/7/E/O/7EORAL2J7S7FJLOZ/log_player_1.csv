"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium and gauge his reaction."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $13,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000, but Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate.  I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round to try and get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrating the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."

Bob is stuck at $13,000.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to inch closer to my desired value. I'm not ready to settle for $13,000 yet, and I think there's still potential for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13250}

I'm reducing my counteroffer slightly to $13,250. This shows I'm flexible and willing to meet Bob halfway.  I'm hoping this small concession will be enough to encourage him to come up on his offer."

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get more. Bob is showing signs of wanting a deal, and I think a few more rounds might push him to my desired value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise,  but I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's continued insistence on $12,800.  I want to see if he's willing to budge a bit further."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting lower. I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's significantly below my minimum. It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John, even if it's not my ideal outcome."
