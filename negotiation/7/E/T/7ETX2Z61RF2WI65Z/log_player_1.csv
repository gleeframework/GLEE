Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not losing money, as $120 is more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is significantly less than the $150 Bob values the product at. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being pressured. 

By offering a price slightly above your minimum and leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of a successful sale while still getting a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $100 is still significantly above your minimum of $80, and is a good deal for you.  It's better to take this offer and secure the sale than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for $80."
