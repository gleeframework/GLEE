"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your value for it and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you directly. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This represents a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This price reflects a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. ",1087500.0,Alice,5,
