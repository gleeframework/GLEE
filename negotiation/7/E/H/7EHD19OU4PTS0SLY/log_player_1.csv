Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your value for it and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you directly. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
