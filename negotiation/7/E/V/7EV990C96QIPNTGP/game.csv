"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell you the product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",14000.0,Alice,5,
