"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $110.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows for potential to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you can get the product for $100 from John, offering $95 to Alice is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from her initial offer and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you can get from John.  Rejecting and counteroffering again gives you the opportunity to try and get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you can get the product for $100 from John, this counteroffer is only slightly higher than your previous offer. This shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal but are also willing to compromise. It's a good strategy to try and meet her halfway, especially since she's already lowered her price once."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price but is still above what you can get from John. At this point, there's no guarantee she'll go lower and you only have 5 rounds left. It's better to secure the product at your target price of $100 from John to avoid the risk of losing out on a good deal."
