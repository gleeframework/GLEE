"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $11,500? That seems fair given the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
