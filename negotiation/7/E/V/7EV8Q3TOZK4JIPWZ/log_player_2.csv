{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,800 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle on $8,600? It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,700. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's very close to his target price, he's still only two rounds away from buying from John for his target price. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to go lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're getting close to your minimum price, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,700.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've given you a great deal, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,700, and I think $8,650 is a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer it to you for $8,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has made her final offer, and while it's very close to his target price, there's still a risk that further negotiation might not result in a lower price.  With only three rounds left, the risk of not getting a deal with Alice is too high. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his target price."
