Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than I hoped, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to meet him halfway and reach a deal without going too far below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a good deal. It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a better price. Accepting his offer is the most logical choice at this point."
