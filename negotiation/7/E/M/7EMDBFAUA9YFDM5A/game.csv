"I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your willingness to sell, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500",12500.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your offer, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,12500.0
"I'm still not convinced that $13500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my original target of $12000. How about we meet at $12800?",12800.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12800, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. I'll counteroffer at $14200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",14200.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $14200. I'd like to make one more offer. How about we meet at $13500, which is the midpoint between my original offer and your last offer?",13500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'll make one more counteroffer, and that's $13800. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to think I should consider other buyers.",13800.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $13600, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",13600.0,Alice,9,,
