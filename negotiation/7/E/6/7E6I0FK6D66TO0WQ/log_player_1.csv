"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not exorbitantly high. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make the price more palatable.
* **Opening for Dialogue:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, indicating a willingness to find a middle ground. 

**Important Note:** I'm not immediately going to John because I want to explore the potential for a better deal with Bob. However, the threat of John is a bargaining chip I can use later if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. The product is a great opportunity, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to him and my minimum.  Accepting it would be a loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm willing to keep negotiating. There's still room for a deal where we both benefit.
* **John as Backup:** While I'm not ready to sell to John yet, I'll keep this option open as a safety net if the negotiation breaks down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  While $700,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $850,000? This would still give you a strong return on your investment, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm presenting a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the potential ROI for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm using language that suggests a desire to find common ground. 

**Important Note:** I'm still keeping the option to sell to John open, but I believe that with a strategic counteroffer, I can still get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 value I need to get.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal.
* **John Remains a Backup:**  I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer. I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $825,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a profit on the sale. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's closer to Bob's latest offer. 
* **Appeal to Value and Profit:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the profit he can still make at this price. 
* **Joint Solution Focus:** The message emphasizes finding a ""solution that works for both of us"", hoping to build a sense of partnership.

**Important Note:** I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price, so I'll be even more strategic with my counteroffers in the next few rounds. John's offer is becoming a more tempting option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 value I need to get.
* **Risk of Stalling:**  If I accept, I'm missing out on the potential for a better deal in the remaining rounds. 
* **John is Now a Real Option:**  With only four rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob and losing out on a better offer from John is becoming very real. However, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your commitment.  I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $800,000? That's my absolute minimum, and it reflects the true value of the product. This is a price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making my final offer, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm signaling to Bob that this is my last chance to close the deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that this price is fair and beneficial for both parties.
* **Decision Time:** The message puts the ball in Bob's court, making it clear that he needs to decide now or risk losing the opportunity.

**Important Note:**  With only three rounds left, the pressure is on.  John's offer is a serious consideration now. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
