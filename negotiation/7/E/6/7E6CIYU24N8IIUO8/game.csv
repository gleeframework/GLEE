"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this point. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $13,000.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
