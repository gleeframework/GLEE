Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to the product's value to you ($100) as possible.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Offering it at $90 is still a $10 profit for Bob if he values it at $80.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, so there's no risk in aiming slightly higher with Bob.

By offering the product at $90, you create a win-win scenario where Bob might accept a price he finds reasonable, and you maximize your potential profit."
