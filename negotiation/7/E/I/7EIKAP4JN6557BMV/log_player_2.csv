"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point.  Bob can likely negotiate a better price, potentially getting closer to his target of $9,500 or even lower. It's more advantageous for Bob to continue negotiating with Alice rather than accepting the offer or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
