"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential benefits of the product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest while still giving me a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500. This is a fair price that considers your need for a profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $11,500 is a good price, and I'm not sure if I can get much more from him in the next round. It's better to secure the deal now than risk him getting another offer and losing this one."
