"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $13,000 is a bit out of my range. How about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
