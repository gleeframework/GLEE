"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $8000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $7500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $8000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8000? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
