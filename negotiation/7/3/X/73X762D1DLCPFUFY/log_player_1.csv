Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming high.  It's important to remember that I have a ""floor"" of $1,000,000 with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob for anything less than that.  By starting high, I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and potentially open a negotiation where we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than my floor price, I believe I can do better.  Bob clearly values the product and I'm going to try and push for a higher price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than that.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my floor price, and I'm not sure if I can get him any higher.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $1,100,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good profit.  I don't want to risk going back and forth with Bob and potentially losing the deal altogether."
