"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or by buying from John.  $900,000 is still too high, considering Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000 and the product is worth $800,000 to Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's significantly lower than my maximum budget and gives you a substantial profit."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $850,000 is a good price, considering it's lower than his maximum budget of $1,500,000 and still leaves a profit for Alice. There is a good chance that Alice would reject a counteroffer and Bob would end up buying the product from John for $1,500,000."
