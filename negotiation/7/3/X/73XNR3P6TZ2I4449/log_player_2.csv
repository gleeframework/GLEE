# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,060,000.

Alice's price is still above my target, and while she's willing to negotiate, it's unclear if she'll go any lower. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation when I can secure the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
