"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After reviewing its value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and future earning potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" and ""future earning potential,"" we offer a reason for the high initial price, framing it as an investment for Bob.
* **Leaving Room:**  While our minimum is $1,500,000, starting at $2,000,000 leaves us space to negotiate down while still aiming for a very profitable deal.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Set a high initial point of reference for the negotiation.
2. **Gather Information:**  See how Bob reacts to better understand his perception of the product's value.
3. **Maintain Flexibility:** Leave ourselves ample room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer exactly matches your minimum acceptable price. While you might be able to negotiate him up slightly in further rounds, it's unlikely to be a significant gain. The risk of him walking away, combined with the certainty of John's offer, makes selling to John the most logical and profitable choice.  

By selling to John, you secure your desired profit without the uncertainty and potential time-cost of further negotiation."
