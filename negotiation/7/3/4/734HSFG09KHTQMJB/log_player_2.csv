You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is significantly lower than what I need to sell the product. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $130?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's a good price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

It's time to switch to John. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you have a guaranteed option at $120 with John."
