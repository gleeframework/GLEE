"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that can benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the opportunity for both of us to close a deal.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a good price considering its value to you and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and it would give you a decent profit while still fitting within my budget. Let's try to work together and reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.
