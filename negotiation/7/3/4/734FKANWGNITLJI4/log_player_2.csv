"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since your goal is to save money and the product is worth $10,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $12,000 is not a good option. Buying from John for $10,000 is also not ideal as you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and sending a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

The product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice is offering $11,000. While it's closer to your desired price, it's still above your target.  There's a chance you can negotiate further. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
 
You're trying to close the gap between Alice's price and your target price.  Offering $10,500 shows you're serious about buying, but still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now only $800 above your target price. This is a small difference, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort. It's more efficient to accept this offer and secure the product."
