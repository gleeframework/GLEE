"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **You don't know the value of the product to Alice.**  This means she might be willing to sell for less than $100. 
* **You have an alternative:** John is selling the same product for $100. This sets a ceiling on how much you're willing to pay.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. This gives you the potential to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  A counteroffer of $80 is a significant reduction from Alice's asking price. This shows you're serious about negotiating and sets the stage for potential back-and-forth.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** You're still willing to pay a significant amount, leaving space for a compromise if Alice counters.
* **Using a clear message:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while stating your position firmly."
