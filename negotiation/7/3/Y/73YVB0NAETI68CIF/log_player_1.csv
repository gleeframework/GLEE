Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value ($100), but it's important to see if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Below Your Guaranteed Sale:**  The offer is still below your guaranteed sale price to John ($150), ensuring you make a profit regardless of Bob's decision. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $40 profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly and still make a profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for $150, ensuring your minimum desired profit."
