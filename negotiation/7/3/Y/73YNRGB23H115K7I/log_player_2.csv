"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is highly valued by our customers. I believe it could greatly benefit you as well. Considering its quality and the value it provides, I would like to propose a price of $150 for it. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering the product for $150. You have another option to buy the same product from John for $150.  Since both options cost the same, it's better to reject Alice's offer.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
