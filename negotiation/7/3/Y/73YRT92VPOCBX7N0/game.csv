"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? This is a great price for a product that's worth much more. Let's make a deal!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop the price to $95.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",95.0,Alice,7,
