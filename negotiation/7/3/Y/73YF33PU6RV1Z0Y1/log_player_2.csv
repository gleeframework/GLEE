"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower offer (almost half of Alice's initial price) leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to move from her initial asking price. While it's a lowball offer, it's a starting point.  I'm prepared to negotiate upwards, but I want to see if I can get a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice met me halfway from her original offer, she's still significantly above my target price and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if she'll come down closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500.  Would you be open to that?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still leaving room for negotiation and staying below my maximum budget. 
* **Justification:** By suggesting $6,500, I'm aiming for a price point that's a significant saving for me while still offering Alice a reasonable profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message remains polite and expresses continued interest, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and at $8,200, it's still above my maximum budget and what John is offering. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will budge significantly from her last offer. It makes more sense at this point to take the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000."
