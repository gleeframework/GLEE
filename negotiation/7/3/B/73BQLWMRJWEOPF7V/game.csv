"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me. Considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits you'll realize, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still fair to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
