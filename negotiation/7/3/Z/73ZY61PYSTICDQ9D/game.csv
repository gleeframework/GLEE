,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
