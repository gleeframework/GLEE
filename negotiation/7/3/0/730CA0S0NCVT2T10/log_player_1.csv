Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $120 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can always meet in the middle (e.g., $110) while still making a profit. 
* **Confidence:**  The tone of the message implies the product's value, potentially encouraging Bob to accept the higher price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while considering Bob's valuation and your fallback option."
