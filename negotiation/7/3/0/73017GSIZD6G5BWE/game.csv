"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  This is a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $100. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $102? It's still a good price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to close the deal.",102.0,Alice,5,
