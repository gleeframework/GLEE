Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build a good rapport.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to increase his perceived value.
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers and negotiations. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as backup:** I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $175 to $140, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open ended question:** By asking ""What do you say?"", I encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.
* **Staying above minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't sell below my threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price, potentially below my minimum threshold.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation.  

I'm choosing to take the guaranteed sale with John to avoid the risk of a lower price with Bob."
