{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  The message emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's potential value to Bob, though I'm not revealing specifics to avoid giving away too much information.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and the possibility of going lower.
*  I'll also keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I'll likely switch to John to avoid selling below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, his message indicates interest.  This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I have a safety net with John's offer, but I'm willing to explore a counteroffer with Bob before resorting to that.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll also emphasize the product's value and reiterate my willingness to negotiate.
* I'll carefully consider Bob's responses and be prepared to walk away if his counteroffers become unreasonable."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value proposition to encourage Bob to see the worth of the product.
* **Finality Implied:** While open to further negotiation, I'm suggesting this price as a fair compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* Analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If he rejects, I'll decide if another counteroffer is worth pursuing, or if I should switch to John's offer.
* I'll remain flexible but firm in my commitment to getting a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? That's the midpoint between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable threshold of $12,000.
* **Value Perception:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle shows he recognizes the product's value to some extent.
* **Risk of John's Offer:**  While I could accept Bob's offer,  John's offer provides a higher guarantee. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. 
* I'll use this opportunity to emphasize the product's value and the benefits of reaching a deal. 
* If Bob continues to offer prices below my minimum, I'll be prepared to switch to John's offer to avoid losing money."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not sure about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, which is $500 below your last offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

* **Secure Alternative:**  John's offer of $12,000 guarantees me my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll politely decline Bob's offer and inform him that I've decided to sell the product to another buyer.
* I'll thank Bob for his time and interest in the product. 
* I'll move forward with selling to John to secure my desired profit."
