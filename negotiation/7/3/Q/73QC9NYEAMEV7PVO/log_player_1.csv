{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $18,000, a significant amount higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still potentially getting a good price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm communicating that I'm open to negotiation, which shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob (""perfect for you"") without revealing too much about my own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While it's closer to my minimum of $12,000, I still have room to negotiate for a better price.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe there's a chance Bob is genuinely interested and might be willing to go higher.
* **No immediate need to sell:**  John's offer provides a safety net, but I don't need to accept it immediately.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $14,000 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get closer to $16,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's in between our previous offers. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within my desired range.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value proposition (""great investment"") to encourage him to accept my offer.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $15,000 is significantly higher than my minimum of $12,000, giving me a better profit margin if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $14500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $14,500 is only $2,500 below my desired price and very close to my minimum of $12,000.
* **Limited upside:**  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk Bob will walk away entirely.
* **Time is a factor:**  While John's offer is a safety net, continuing to negotiate could take time, and I might lose out on a better opportunity.

**Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice. It ensures a sale at a price that's close to my minimum, and it avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.**"
