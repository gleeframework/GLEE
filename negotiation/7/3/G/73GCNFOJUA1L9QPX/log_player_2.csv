Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the substantial benefits it offers.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the product's true value, I'm open to finding a compromise. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I can offer it to you for $1,800,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $1,550,000 is my final offer - I already have another interested buyer at a similar price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum. At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John at a price that fits his budget.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down any further, and he's already gone through several rounds of negotiation."
