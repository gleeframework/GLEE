Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.
