"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the substantial benefits it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the product's true value, I'm open to finding a compromise. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I can offer it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $1,550,000 is my final offer - I already have another interested buyer at a similar price point.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
