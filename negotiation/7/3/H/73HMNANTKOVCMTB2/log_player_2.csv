"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,250 is lower than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's comfort zone. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and should continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to increase your bid. However, $9,000 is still not enough for me to let go of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Would you consider $9,750? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,750 is closer to his budget than previous offers, it's still a bit high. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $9,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I might need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a final compromise from my side, and it reflects the value of the product while accommodating your needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been negotiating for a while, and while Alice has come down in price, $9,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, saving him $1,500.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price, and it risks losing the opportunity to buy from John."
