"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get closer to his ideal price point. He's starting with a lower counteroffer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is a little low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $10,250 is better than John's $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that works better for my budget.  How about $10,000?  That's a good middle ground and would let us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small concession by moving closer to Alice's last offer but still trying to secure a better deal.  $10,000 is still within his budget and leaves room for Alice to also make a small compromise."
