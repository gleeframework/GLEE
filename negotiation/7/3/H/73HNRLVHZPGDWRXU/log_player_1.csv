Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair deal considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
