{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good price, but I can potentially get closer to my goal of $1,000,000. I have 8 rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This still gives you a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $920,000 is closer to my target, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I have 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we settle on $940,000? This represents a compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to make some adjustments to fit my budget. I'm willing to go up to $930000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $930,000 is very close to my target of $950,000, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for $800,000 is too high.  I'm happy with this outcome."
