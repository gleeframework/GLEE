"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to go that low? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your interest, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer for the product is $9,200. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is a good compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially increasing the price is too high. It's also getting closer to the price offered by John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $800 compared to buying from John and secures the product at a reasonable price."
