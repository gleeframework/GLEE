"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the value I believe it's worth. Can you consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price reflects the true value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. How about we try $9,800? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. $9,800 is close, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work.  Would you be willing to consider $10,200? I believe this is a fair compromise.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
