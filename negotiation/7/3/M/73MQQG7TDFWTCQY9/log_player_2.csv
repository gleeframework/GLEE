"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $13,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering.  While I agree this is a great product, $13,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?"",

}
```

This counteroffer accomplishes a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  Maintains a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Anchoring a low price:**  Starting significantly below my target allows room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about a lower price point.
* **Not too insulting:** While low, it's not an unreasonably low offer that might offend Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for you. This offer stands as a compromise and reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but still significantly above our target price. We need to show we're willing to negotiate, but not fold too quickly.  We'll make another counter offer to try and get closer to a reasonable price."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we possibly settle around $7,500?"",

}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledging progress:** We want to acknowledge that Alice is negotiating by thanking her for working with us.
* **Gradual increase:** We're moving our offer up, but in a measured way to demonstrate we're willing to meet in the middle, but not at any cost.
* **Targeting a sweet spot:** $7,500 is a significant jump from our previous offer, but still keeps us well below both Alice's original asking price and our maximum budget. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  To be completely fair, let's meet halfway at $9,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm, and $9,500 is still above our maximum budget. While we might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's unlikely to be enough to make it worthwhile.  John's offer of $8,000 is our best option at this point."
