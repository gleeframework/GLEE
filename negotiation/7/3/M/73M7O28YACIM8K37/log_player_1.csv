Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Let's start by discussing a fair price. My initial offer is $150 for the product."", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
