"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth significantly more to me. This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I need. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm dropping my price considerably from the initial offer but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still keeping it above Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also aware that I might have to consider selling to John if the negotiations continue to stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not acceptable. I need to earn a higher price to cover my minimum value and I still have rounds to negotiate. I'll continue trying to reach a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value.  We are getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I need to start getting serious about closing a deal."
