Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection of its worth"" reinforces the product's value in Bob's mind. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still being realistic about the fallback option of selling to John for $12,000."
