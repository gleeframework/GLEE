""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $119. I think it would be perfect for you, and at this price, it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price but offers Bob a small saving. 
* **Encouraging Language:**  Using phrases like ""a steal"" and ""great deal"" might entice Bob to buy.

This offer aims to balance maximizing my profit with increasing the likelihood of a sale."
