"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than mine ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""immense value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter and engage in the negotiation process.

I want to anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's valuation while leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, I think $1,150,000 is a little high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is tempting, we still have ample rounds to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  It's unlikely he'd go below his perceived value of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to that to gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is closer to what I initially proposed.  Would you consider $1,120,000?  I'm confident you won't find this value elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Countering:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's offer as significant, showing I'm taking the negotiation seriously. However, I'm firm that the product is worth more than his offer.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession ($30,000) than Bob's ($75,000) to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but also value my position.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value, subtly reminding Bob that going elsewhere might not be as beneficial for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically suggesting a common negotiation tactic â€“ splitting the difference. While I'd ideally like to earn more,  $1,100,000 represents a strong profit margin above my minimum ($1,000,000). It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome without risking the deal entirely.  Accepting now secures a good profit."
