Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Alice has a strong fallback option with John ($10,000), which gives her leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

By aiming high but remaining reasonable, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a great deal with Bob."
