"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and it's still within my budget. Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my target price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to try and squeeze out a bit more in the next few rounds before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $12,750 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,900 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us to both benefit from this transaction. Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12,900 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. This is a fair compromise and will allow us to both benefit from this deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm worried about running out of rounds and having to sell to John for a lower price than I'd like.  This deal gives me a good return, and it's a good way to move the product quickly."
