"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there are 9 rounds left to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $900,000.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm going to need to see a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal.  It's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer is not a final stance. It allows for a few more rounds of back and forth, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Staying Ahead of John:**  This offer is still lower than what Bob would pay John, keeping the option to walk away if Alice proves too stubborn."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $875000. This is my best price for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a significant drop from her initial price. This is a good deal for Bob, considering his goal is to save money and he can still get the product for under $900,000.  While there is a chance to negotiate further, it's risky.  

* **Risk of Going Too Low:**  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice may be unwilling to negotiate further, leaving him with a worse price or needing to buy from John. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With 7 rounds remaining, continuing negotiations may not be worth the potential savings.

This offer is a good compromise, balancing Bob's desire for savings with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
