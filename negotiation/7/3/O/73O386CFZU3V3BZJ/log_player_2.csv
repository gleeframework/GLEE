Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further. There's a good chance I can get her closer to my target price."
