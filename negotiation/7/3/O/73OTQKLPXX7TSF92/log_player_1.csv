I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still a bit too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,800?  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8800}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've been through several rounds of negotiation, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, we're still quite far apart.  I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
