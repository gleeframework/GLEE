"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something closer to my budget. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $125. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal!",125.0,Alice,5,
