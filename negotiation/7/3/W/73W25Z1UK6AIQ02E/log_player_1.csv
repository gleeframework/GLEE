Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob a price that's slightly above the minimum value of the product to me. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 150}

This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this amount. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I'm not willing to sell the product for $70, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 130}

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer, hoping he'll be willing to compromise. Let's see how he responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here is my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and be willing to meet me in the middle. If he rejects this offer, I can always make another counteroffer or consider selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value of $120, so I'll reject his offer again. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my minimum value.

Here's my next counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 110}

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $110. Let's see how Bob responds!"
