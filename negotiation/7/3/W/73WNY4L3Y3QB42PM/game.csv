"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of this product. Let's try to reach a deal this round.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice,  I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's aim for a final price of $1,125,000.  This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
