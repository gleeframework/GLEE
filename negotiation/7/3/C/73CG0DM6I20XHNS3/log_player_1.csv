Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him room to negotiate while ensuring I still profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. I hope this aligns better with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's closer than his previous offer and  is a reasonable compromise.  I'd rather sell to Bob than go through another round of negotiation, or sell to John at a higher price but with less profit."
