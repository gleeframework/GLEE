Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000 again, and I'm willing to throw in a small concession - I'll also take on the cost of shipping and handling. Can we meet at $1,250,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll make one last offer: $1,200,000, and I'm willing to pay cash upfront to seal the deal. Can you consider this final offer?

Bob is firmly rooted at $1,200,000 and unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better offer. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the minimum acceptable price for the product."
