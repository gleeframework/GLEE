{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum but below Bob's maximum value.  It also sets a friendly tone and emphasizes the potential value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is more than my minimum, it is still significantly below my desired price. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $78? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is getting close to my minimum, it is still slightly below it. I don't want to risk going further down in price and potentially losing out on a better deal. Selling to John for $80 ensures I meet my minimum requirement and avoid further negotiation."
