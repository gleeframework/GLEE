Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm interested in the product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to offer $850000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
