"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $160 for it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $80 is quite low for this product.  It's high quality and really useful! How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still too much for me. I'm really only able to offer $100. I think that's a fair price considering we are both trying to make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but I can't let this go for $100. It's worth significantly more than that. How about $120, my final offer. This is a great deal!",120.0,Alice,5,
