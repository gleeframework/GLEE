,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  That gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I still feel that $10,250 is slightly above what I am comfortable paying. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns closely with its perceived value to me and keeps the transaction within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
