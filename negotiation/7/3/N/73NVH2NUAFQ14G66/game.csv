"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great price considering the value the product will bring to your life.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,500 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll really benefit from it.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $7,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $6,750? That would work well for me.",6750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $6,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",6900.0,Alice,5,
