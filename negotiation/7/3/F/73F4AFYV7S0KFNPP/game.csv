"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",135.0,Alice,5,
