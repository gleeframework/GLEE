Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,800,000 to you. To start the negotiation, I propose a price of $1,600,000. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To move things forward, I can come down to $1,450,000. This is a substantial reduction, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually agreeable deal.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.
