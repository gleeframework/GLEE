"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting at this price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. There's no benefit to accepting it, as you can get the product for the same price from John. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows the possibility of getting a lower price from Alice."
