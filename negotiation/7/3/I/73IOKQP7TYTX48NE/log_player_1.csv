Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 (150% of its value to both of you) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively and encourages dialogue, increasing the chances of Bob engaging in a negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have the flexibility to reduce your asking price, but always keep in mind your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000 from John)."
