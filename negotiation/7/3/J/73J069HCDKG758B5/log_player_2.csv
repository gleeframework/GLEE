"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice.  By offering $10,500, he's giving Alice a small profit while still getting a significant discount.  This counteroffer might be enticing enough for Alice to accept, but if not, it establishes a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price point and still better than John's offer of $15,000. While there might be a chance to negotiate further, accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures a good deal for Bob. There's a high chance that further negotiation might not result in a better price, and Bob could potentially end up paying more if he rejects this offer and Alice changes her mind or becomes less willing to negotiate."
