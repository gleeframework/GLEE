"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $1,750,000 allows for potential compromise while still securing a profit above my minimum threshold.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:**  $1,400,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.  
* **Not selling to John yet:**  Selling to John would guarantee $1,500,000, but I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. Considering the value of this product and the potential it holds for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within my minimum threshold:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring I get a good price.
* **Compromise and flexibility:**  I've lowered my price from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to create a sense of urgency and increase his desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Close to John's offer:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, it's getting closer to John's offer of $1,500,000.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher before resorting to selling to John.
* **More room for negotiation:** There's still potential for Bob to increase his offer. I'll continue the negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 just doesn't work for me. This product is truly unique, and I believe it's worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, showing a genuine desire to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's uniqueness to justify the price point.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum threshold:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No room for improvement:**  There's little chance of getting a higher price from Bob, as he's already stated this is his maximum. 
* **Equally good offer:** Selling to John would also net me $1,500,000. However,  accepting Bob's offer is a quicker and more direct path to closing the deal."
