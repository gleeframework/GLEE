"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 just doesn't work for me. This product is truly unique, and I believe it's worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
