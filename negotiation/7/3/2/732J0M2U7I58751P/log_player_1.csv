Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but the ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other interested buyers"" might entice him to pay a premium. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely in this scenario, starting high leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll still get your guaranteed $12,000 from John, but you'll miss out on the potential extra profit."
