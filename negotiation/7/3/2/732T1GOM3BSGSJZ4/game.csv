"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I still need to secure at least $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's settle on this and finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on $1,300,000, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1280000.0,Bob,8,
