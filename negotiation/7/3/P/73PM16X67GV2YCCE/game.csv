"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider something closer to $16,000? I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
