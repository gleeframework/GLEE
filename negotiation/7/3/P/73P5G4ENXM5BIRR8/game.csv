"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than $950,000. My counteroffer is $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price closer to $1,000,000.  How about $1,025,000?  This would allow us both to achieve our goals.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,025,000. My counteroffer is $1,037,500.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're very close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm thinking $1,032,500. This is a fair price that still leaves some room for negotiation, but also reflects the product's worth.",1032500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,032,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, at $1,031,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's make this happen.",1031250.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,031,250, but I'd like to add a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'm thinking $1,032,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a slight premium for the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",1032000.0,Alice,9,
