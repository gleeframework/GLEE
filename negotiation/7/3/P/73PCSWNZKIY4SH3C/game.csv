"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000?  It's still a great price for such a valuable product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiation we've had so far.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900 as a final compromise.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
