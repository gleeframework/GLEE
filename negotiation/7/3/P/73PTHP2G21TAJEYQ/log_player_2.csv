"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $95 and my maximum price of $100. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $93, which is still within my budget of $100. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's only $3 more than my last counteroffer, and I'm not sure how much further I can push her.  There's always the risk that she'll get stubborn and I'll end up paying $100 to John."
