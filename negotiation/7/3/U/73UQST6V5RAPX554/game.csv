"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-end item that's worth a lot to many people. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value might be high to others, but my budget is limited. I am willing to consider a price closer to my maximum limit of $800000. Could we discuss a price that falls within this range?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a significant stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to some negotiation. Let's meet at $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my current financial situation, I am still unable to reach $1100000. I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum limit of $800000. Would it be possible to find a middle ground that respects both our positions?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I'm not ready to give up on the deal yet. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. While $950000 is closer to what I can afford, I still feel there might be room for further discussion. I am willing to consider a price slightly below $950000, perhaps around $900000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations while respecting my budget.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I can see that you're getting closer to my minimum price. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $950000. Let's try $925000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your flexibility. I believe we could reach an agreement that respects both our needs. I am willing to consider a price of $910000. This proposal is higher than my initial offer but still within my budget, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see that you're willing to stretch your budget, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $915000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your understanding, Alice. I've been trying to find a balance that works for both of us. Based on our discussions, I believe we can agree on a price of $912500. This is a reasonable compromise that respects my budget constraints while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",912500.0,Bob,10,
