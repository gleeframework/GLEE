I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value.  This allows for potential negotiation and gives me a good starting point to see what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to accept Bob's low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum value and close to John's offer. It's in my best interest to accept and finalize the sale rather than risk further negotiation or settling for John's offer."
