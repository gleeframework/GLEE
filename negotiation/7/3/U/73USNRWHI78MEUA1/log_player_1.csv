Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're guaranteed to make a profit, even if Bob accepts. 
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum value:**  This gives Bob a clear incentive to accept the offer as he'll still make a profit.

By offering this price, you increase your chances of getting a higher sale price while also leaving room for negotiation if needed."
