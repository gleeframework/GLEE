Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not going to accept an offer that's lower than my minimum. It's worth it to me to continue negotiating with Bob or consider selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be mindful of your budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,225,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,237,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1237500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,237,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I'm not going any higher. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's getting late in the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by rejecting his offer and potentially having him walk away.  I'll take the $1,225,000 and call it a day."
