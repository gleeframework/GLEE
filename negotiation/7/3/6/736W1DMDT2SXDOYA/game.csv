"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product is worth $8,000 to me, I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm still looking to get a good profit from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $9,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,250, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a new price of $9,400. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",9400.0,Alice,5,
