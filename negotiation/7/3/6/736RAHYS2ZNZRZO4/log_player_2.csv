"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate the value you're offering.  While I'm interested,  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $13,000?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm going to counteroffer at $13,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a good deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer, forcing Bob to either accept her final offer or buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with."
