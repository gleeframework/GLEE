"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's valued at $8,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $7,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",7000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be feasible?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $6,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $6,800. This is a fair price considering the value and the progress we've made.",6800.0,Alice,5,
