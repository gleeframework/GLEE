"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's valued at $8,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum valuation. I will reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying well below my maximum budget. The goal is to try and understand Alice's lower bound quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $7,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $7,000 is closer to a reasonable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and continue to counter in hopes of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to my ideal target while acknowledging Alice's movement on the price. It keeps the negotiation open and allows for further adjustments from either side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $6,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $6,800. This is a fair price considering the value and the progress we've made. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down considerably in price, and $6,800 is a reasonable deal. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation pushing the price up or reaching an impasse."
