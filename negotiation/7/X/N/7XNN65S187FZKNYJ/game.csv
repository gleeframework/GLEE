"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $800,000?  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase the product from John for that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $815,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
