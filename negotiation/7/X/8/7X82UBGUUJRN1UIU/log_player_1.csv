Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and am happy to offer it to you at a price of $19,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I list it publicly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, you want to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down, while still keeping you above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning that you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply that this is a limited-time offer.

**Important Note:** While you know Bob's perceived value is $12,000,  he doesn't know that you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This gives you an advantage in the negotiation."
