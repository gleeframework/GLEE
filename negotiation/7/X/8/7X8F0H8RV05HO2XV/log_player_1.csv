Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for you to make concessions if needed.
* **It's not too aggressive:** It shows you're open to a deal, rather than trying to squeeze him for every penny.

I'll be watching how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and/or explore the option of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm hoping to stay within my budget, and this would be a good compromise for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm also going to keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm hoping that a slight counter-offer will be enough to get Bob back to the negotiation table.  This offer still gives him a $1000 discount on my initial price, and it's much closer to my minimum. If he rejects, I will consider selling to John."
