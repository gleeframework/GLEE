"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. I can see that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $13,500? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $11,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still trying to get the best deal. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
