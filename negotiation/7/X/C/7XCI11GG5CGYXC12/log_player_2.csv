"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $150 from John, you can still potentially get a better deal. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice values the product at $100.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's price, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It also positions you at a good starting point for negotiation. If she rejects this offer, you can still potentially get a better price without having to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget and a good compromise. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject again, and I'd be forced to buy from John at $150.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now."
