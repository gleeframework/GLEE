Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hopeful Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  Remember, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that undervalues the product.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It's a good deal, and it guarantees I get my minimum value."
