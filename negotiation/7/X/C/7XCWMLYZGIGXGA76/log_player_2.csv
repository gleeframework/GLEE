"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still too high, and he has room to negotiate. There's a good chance he can get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  He should try to get closer to Alice's valuation of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's value as possible while still leaving some room for further negotiation.  $850,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves a comfortable margin for her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer, which is a sign she might be more willing to negotiate.  While $920,000 is still too high, Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating.  He can try a counteroffer closer to $850,000, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's latest offer of $920,000.  $875,000 is a reasonable compromise that allows for some room for further negotiation. It also demonstrates Bob's willingness to reach an agreement while still maintaining a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasing her offer, but it's still too high. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating.  He has time left and should aim to get closer to his desired price. It's a risky move to accept Alice's offer, considering John's offer is only $50,000 higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price point, but he's still holding firm and leaving a small profit margin for Alice. This counteroffer is an attempt to find a middle ground.  The next few rounds will be crucial to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still too high.  It's important to remember that Bob has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000. This means Bob can afford to be slightly more aggressive in his negotiations with Alice.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to continue to try to get a better deal.  He has a few rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has to start getting closer to Alice's valuation, considering the number of rounds remaining.  $900,000 is a reasonable compromise, leaving a smaller profit margin for Alice but offering a good deal for Bob compared to John's offer.  This counteroffer aims to show Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still too high.  With only one round remaining, it's unlikely that Alice will significantly lower her price. Buying from John is the best option in this scenario. 

Bob is likely to lose more money if he keeps negotiating with Alice and ends up having to buy from John at the last minute. 

Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget, while also ending the negotiation process with Alice, which has become unproductive."
