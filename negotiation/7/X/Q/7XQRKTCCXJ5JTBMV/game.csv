,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  It's a fair price that's close to your offer and still allows me to get a decent return on my investment.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",10000.0,Bob,4,
