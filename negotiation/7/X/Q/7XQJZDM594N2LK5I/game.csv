"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, I'm aiming closer to my initial asking price. Would you consider $1,800,000? This reflects the inherent value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
