Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit.  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your final profit.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, ensuring you won't lose money if Bob declines."
