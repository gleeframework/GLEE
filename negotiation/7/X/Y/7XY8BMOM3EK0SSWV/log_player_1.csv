{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept or make a new counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about $9,000? It's still a good deal for you since you value it at $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,100 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,100 is very close to my last counter-offer of $9,250.  At this point, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since I can sell to John for $8,000. It's better to secure the sale and earn a decent profit."
