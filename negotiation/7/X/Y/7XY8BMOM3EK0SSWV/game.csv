"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about $9,000? It's still a good deal for you since you value it at $8,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
