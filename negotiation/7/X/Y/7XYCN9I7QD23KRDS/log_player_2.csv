"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high for him. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He's starting with a counteroffer that's $2,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, which is within the acceptable range for Bob and likely still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get a better price.  $11,000 is closer to his target, but he can likely get it for less.  He should try to counteroffer again to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer you $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to purchase the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, offering a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current one. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still trying to save money. It also leaves room for Alice to counteroffer again if she's not satisfied."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10500 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $10750.  This would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. While $10,750 is still a little higher than his ideal, it's a good compromise. He has limited rounds left, and if he rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will continue to lower the price. Buying from John would cost him significantly more. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and with a decent discount."
