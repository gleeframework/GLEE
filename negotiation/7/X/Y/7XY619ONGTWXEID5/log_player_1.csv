{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,500, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Showing Interest:** My message is friendly and suggests the product is a good fit for Bob, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price leaves room for counteroffers from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation while still ensuring I can walk away with at least $12,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,500 is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Counter-offering is a better option:** I have room to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my minimum by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I have John's offer as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm looking for something a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it would be a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum.
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal for him at $11,000, making it more appealing.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" and ""fair compromise"" to keep the tone of the conversation friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a bit tight on budget, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  That's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Counter-offering is worthwhile:**  I can likely get closer to my desired price by making another counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I'm not desperate, so I can afford to be patient and keep negotiating with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still a bit higher than $10,750, but to show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $11,250.
