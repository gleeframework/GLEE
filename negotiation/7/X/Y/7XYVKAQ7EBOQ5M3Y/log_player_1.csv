Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizing profit:**  By starting high, I increase the potential for a higher final price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Giving Bob some room to counter means he's more likely to engage and potentially agree to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can always move on to John, ensuring I won't lose out on a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially get a better price.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  While Bob's offer is below my minimum, there's still a chance he might come up a bit in subsequent rounds.
* **Testing Bob's limits:**  Rejecting his offer shows him I'm not willing to settle for a low price, potentially pushing him to offer more.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, I retain the option of moving to John if the negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $160 is a compromise that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" and encourages Bob to continue negotiating. It's a friendly tone that aims to keep the negotiation positive.

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  $160 is a significant step closer to my desired range, showing Bob I'm serious about getting a deal done.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I still leave room for Bob to counter, potentially reaching a final price that works for both of us. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not settling for a low price, showing Bob that I have options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $140, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting his offer means I can sell the product and earn a profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit, which is my primary goal. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly higher price, but it would also require more time and effort. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While John offers a guaranteed $150, there's always a chance the negotiations with Bob might fall apart, leading to a lower final price or even no sale.

**Conclusion:**

This offer provides a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale."
