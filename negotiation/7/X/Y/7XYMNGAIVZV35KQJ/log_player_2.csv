"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This item is not just a possession; it's a symbol of excellence and a testament to craftsmanship. I believe its true worth surpasses $10000, but considering our potential partnership, I am willing to extend this offer at a special price of $15000. This is an exceptional chance for you to own something truly remarkable. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. I don't think the product is worth more than $12,000 to me, so paying $15,000 is not a good deal. I'll look for a better price.
