"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As for the price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,500? That's a good price for you, and it's within my budget. Let's make this deal happen!",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.
