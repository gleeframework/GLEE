"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,200,000. I believe this is still a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your position. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,300,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,250,000. This price is closer to our initial positions and gives us both room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm willing to compromise slightly further.  Let's settle this at $1,275,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
