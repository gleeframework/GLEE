"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm eager to make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if we keep talking. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'm firm on that number.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
