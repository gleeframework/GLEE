Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm eager to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if we keep talking. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'm firm on that number.  Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob is now at our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will go any higher. Accepting ensures we make the sale and don't risk losing the $1,200,000 from John."
