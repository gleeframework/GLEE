"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, making it more cost-effective to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
