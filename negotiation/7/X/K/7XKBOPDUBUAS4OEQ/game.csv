"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while remaining manageable for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
