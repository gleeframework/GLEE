"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is far too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  I understand it's valuable to you, but that's my top limit. Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I'm not comfortable going higher.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
