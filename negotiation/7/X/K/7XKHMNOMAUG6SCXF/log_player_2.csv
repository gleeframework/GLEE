"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum value of $10,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum value of $10,000. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since I have the option of buying from John at my desired price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
