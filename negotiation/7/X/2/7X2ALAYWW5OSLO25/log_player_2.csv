"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer with Alice to see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $11,000?  This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, $13,000 is still above his budget. He can get the product for less from John. It's worth exploring a counteroffer with Alice again, but he should be prepared to walk away and buy from John if they can't agree on a price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500?  This price is fair to both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more on this deal. How about we meet in the middle of $11,500 and $13,000, at $12,250? This way, we can both feel good about the price, and I can still get a decent return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $12,250 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. While Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, it seems unlikely they'll go lower than $12,250.  It's better to buy from John and save the money."
