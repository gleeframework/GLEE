"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a special offer just for you.

"Alice,  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $11,000?  This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500?  This price is fair to both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more on this deal. How about we meet in the middle of $11,500 and $13,000, at $12,250? This way, we can both feel good about the price, and I can still get a decent return on my investment.",12250.0,Alice,5,
