**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and negotiating.  We have room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price higher than $800,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting very close to our minimum, and we're still significantly above John's offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling."
