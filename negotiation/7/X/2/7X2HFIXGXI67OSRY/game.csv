"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider  $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $700,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'll meet you at $650,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
