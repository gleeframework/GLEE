"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $95? It's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $100? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price for this great product.",100.0,Alice,5,
