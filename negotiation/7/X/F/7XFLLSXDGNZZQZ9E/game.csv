"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  It's a game-changer with the potential to generate substantial returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has potential, but I still think $1,400,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
