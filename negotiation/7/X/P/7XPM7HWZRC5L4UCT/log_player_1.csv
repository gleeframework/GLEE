Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price. 
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at your desired price sets a firm anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  While vague, mentioning the value to you and a potential public listing implies the price is unlikely to go much lower. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob might try to negotiate down from $10,000 since it's more than his perceived value.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly, but not below your guaranteed $10,000 from John."
