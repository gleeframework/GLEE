# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your latest proposal carefully, but unfortunately, I still cannot meet your price of $1,425,000. I'm hoping for a price closer to my budget of $1,350,000. Considering the value you're providing, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.
