Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is far greater, especially considering its long-term potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects my strong belief in the product and its ability to generate significant returns for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's work together to find a price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation:

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. At this point, continuing the negotiation poses a risk of leaving money on the table. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is more than Bob's current offer. It makes the most financial sense to sell the product to John now."
