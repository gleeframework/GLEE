Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the quality and potential of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $18,000 offer provides some room for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" and ""quality"" of the product helps justify the higher price, even if Bob perceives the value to be lower. 
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning listing it ""publicly,"" you subtly introduce a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster."
