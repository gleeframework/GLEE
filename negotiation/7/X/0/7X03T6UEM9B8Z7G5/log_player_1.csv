Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. It's a unique item and I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows me to potentially earn a higher profit.
* **Strategic pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  There's a chance he might see it as a good deal, especially if he perceives the item as scarce. 
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can confidently sell to John at my desired minimum price."
