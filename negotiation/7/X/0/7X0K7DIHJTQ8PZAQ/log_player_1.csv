"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $200 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and makes the negotiation more pleasant. 
* **Open-ended question:** The question ""Let me know what you think!"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There is still room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to buy the product. 
* **More rounds available:**  I have more rounds to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is way too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than my minimum:**  $175 is still above my minimum of $150, but shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Addressing Bob's concerns:**  I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal and emphasize that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Giving Bob an option:**  I ask for his opinion to encourage further negotiation and keep the conversation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is firm at $80. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is not budging:** Bob has repeatedly offered $80, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There is a high chance that further negotiation will lead to another low offer from Bob.
* **Secure option:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
