This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also setting a positive tone by emphasizing the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by countering."

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $775,000 is still a bit too low. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further before considering selling to John."
