{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140? That's still a good deal for you and closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150.  This ensures I meet my minimum and  get a better price than Bob's offer."
