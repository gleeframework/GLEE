"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This allows us both to make a healthy profit and ensures a smooth transaction. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows us to make a significant profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it gives us both a good profit margin. I'm confident we can reach a deal if you're willing to be flexible.",825000.0,Bob,4,
