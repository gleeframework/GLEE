"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,
