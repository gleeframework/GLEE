{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price is fair considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it also gives me some room to negotiate.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm also aware that I can sell the product to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm also ready to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for less than $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also ready to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm getting the feeling that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm not willing to continue negotiating with him and risk getting stuck with a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to sell it to John for $1,500,000, which is a much better outcome."
