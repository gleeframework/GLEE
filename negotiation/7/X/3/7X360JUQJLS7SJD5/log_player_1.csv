{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  Based on its potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, and I'm interested in the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's more in line with my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal."

To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant value the product offers, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
