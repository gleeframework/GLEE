Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to consider $825,000 as my final offer. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value you'll gain.

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000, and it's clear she's holding firm on that price.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to go with that option and save the extra $25,000."
