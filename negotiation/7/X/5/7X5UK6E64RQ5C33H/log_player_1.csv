{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance for us to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Setting a fair tone:** I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" and ""value"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message explicitly invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation process open.

**Important:** I'm not making the offer too close to my minimum, as that leaves less room for negotiation and could risk Bob simply rejecting the offer and moving on.  This approach provides a better chance for reaching an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, and I'd like to discuss a better price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as there's still a gap between our desired prices. By rejecting his offer, I maintain the leverage to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This gives us both a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept."", ""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but presenting a counteroffer to keep the negotiation alive.
* **Compromise:** I emphasize that I'm willing to compromise to show flexibility.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I suggest a price halfway between our last two offers, which can feel like a fair compromise for both parties.
* **Reasoning:** I explain the price by stating it's a ""good deal"" for both, giving a reason for my choice.
* **Positive language:**  I use phrases like ""comfortable"" and ""good deal"" to maintain a positive and constructive tone.

This approach aims to reach a middle ground while keeping the negotiations open, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices, which would be $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come closer to my desired price, $1,150,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I am not willing to sell for less than my minimum, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting his offer, I am keeping the negotiations open and maintaining the leverage to potentially secure a higher price. I am confident that with a little more negotiation, I can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I understand we both want a fair deal, so let's try $1,165,000. This is a small step closer to your offer, and it keeps the negotiations moving in a positive direction."", ""product_price"": 1165000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm presenting a counteroffer to keep the negotiation process going.
* **Slight Adjustment:**  I'm increasing my offer by $15,000, showing a willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum. This small adjustment signals flexibility without drastically changing my position.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I use phrases like ""fair deal"" and ""positive direction"" to keep the negotiation constructive.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, suggesting it's a small step closer to Bob's offer, keeping the conversation focused on reaching an agreement.

This approach aims to maintain a balanced position between pushing for my desired price and staying open to finding a compromise. This strategy increases the chances of closing the deal with Bob while ensuring I don't sell for a price significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,160,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

The gap between our desired prices is now very small.  However, I'm at my limit and  $1,160,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

There's a risk that we'll keep going back and forth with small adjustments, and I'm not sure if Bob is truly willing to go any higher.  I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and it's time to cut my losses.  

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price, which is more important than trying to squeeze a little bit more out of Bob. It's a more predictable outcome, and it saves me time and effort."
