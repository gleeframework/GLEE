"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $8,500. Would you consider a final offer of $8,750? It's a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand we're getting close. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer $8,750, which is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. It's my final offer.",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $8,750. I'm still confident that you value this product at $10,000, and I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,7,
