Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.

``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
