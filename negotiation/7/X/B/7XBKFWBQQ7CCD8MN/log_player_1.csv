"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. I want to leave room for bargaining while still securing a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time by a smaller margin. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a good price. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's likely that I won't get a better offer from Bob.  It's also important to consider the risk of going back and forth and ultimately ending up with John's lower offer."
