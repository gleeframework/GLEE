"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $16,000. I believe it holds significant value that will benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $16,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for significantly less from John.  It makes sense to negotiate with Alice, potentially saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $8,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $16,000 is closer to its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, potentially getting the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
