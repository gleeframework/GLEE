"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will surely bring you great benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds great, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $10,500 is still a little high for my budget. Could you meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  How about we settle this right now at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're really close, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $9,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
