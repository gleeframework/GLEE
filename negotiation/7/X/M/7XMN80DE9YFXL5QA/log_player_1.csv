While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,275,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We're still securing a $275,000 profit above our minimum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation and gets us the money faster. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Extended negotiations can lead to frustration on both sides. Accepting shows goodwill. 

It's a strong offer, and accepting ensures a successful deal."
