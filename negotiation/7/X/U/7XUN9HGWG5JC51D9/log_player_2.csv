"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than your $12,000 maximum. While you could try to haggle, it's not guaranteed Alice would go lower and you'd risk losing out on a price that's already within your budget."
