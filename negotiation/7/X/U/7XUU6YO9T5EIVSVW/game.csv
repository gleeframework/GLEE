"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $2,000,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which reflects its worth to me while giving you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and recognizes the true worth of what's on the table.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring your product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
