Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $2,000,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which reflects its worth to me while giving you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and recognizes the true worth of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring your product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is a good business decision at this point. It's a significant amount above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether."
