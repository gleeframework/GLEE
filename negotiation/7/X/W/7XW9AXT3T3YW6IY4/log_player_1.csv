Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,000,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Alice needs to find a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept but also maximizes her profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why this Offer Makes Sense**

* **Profit Maximization:** This price allows Alice to capture a significant portion of the potential profit ($150,000), exceeding her minimum by a large margin.
* **Attractive to Bob:** Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than his perceived value, making it a good deal for him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves a little room for Bob to potentially negotiate, which can be beneficial in securing a deal. 

**Important Notes:**

* This offer assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or any time constraints.
* Depending on the context and the nature of the product, Alice might adjust her approach slightly. However, the core principle of aiming for the sweet spot between her minimum and Bob's maximum remains crucial."
