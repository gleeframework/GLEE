"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John. Since Alice is offering $9,000, there's room to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $8,500, which is still above her desired price of $8,000. This gives her an incentive to accept, while also saving me $500 compared to Alice's initial offer.  It's a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $9,200, which is still lower than John's price of $10,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll reject further counteroffers and I might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product at $9,200, which is still a good deal."
