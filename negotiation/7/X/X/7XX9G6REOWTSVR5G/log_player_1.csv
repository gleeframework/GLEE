"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product is ""worth a lot more"" to emphasize its potential value to Bob.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:**  I explicitly say I'm ""willing to negotiate"" to signal openness and encourage a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Can you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum value:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for a higher offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price. 
* **Selling to John as a backup:** I know I can always sell to John for $120, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is my minimum, but I'm willing to go a bit higher to close this deal. How about $135? "", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price in between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the deal:** I mention ""closing this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds. 
* **Staying above minimum:** I'm still above my minimum value, leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $135. Can you meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's not my ideal price, I can still try to negotiate higher in future rounds if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Time constraint:**  I have limited rounds, and accepting this offer allows me to move forward without risking losing time with further negotiations.
* **John as a safety net:** If I need to, I can still sell to John for $120 as a backup option."
