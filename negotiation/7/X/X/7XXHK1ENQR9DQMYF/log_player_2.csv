"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a game-changer in its field and offers unparalleled value. Given its significance to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth of $12,000 to you, I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored specifically for you, ensuring you get the best deal possible. Please let me know if this offer aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using sales tactics to inflate the perceived value of the product.  While she's offering a ""discount"", $9,500 is still significantly more than your maximum budget and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with John's offer, saving you a considerable amount."
