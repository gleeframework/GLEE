"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $16,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $16,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",12000.0,Bob,4,
