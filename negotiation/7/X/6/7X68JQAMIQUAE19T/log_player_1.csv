Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This creates a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Motivation:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm leaving room for negotiation but not sacrificing too much. 
* **Alternative:** I also want to remind Bob that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $15,000, subtly indicating I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $13000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.
* **Negotiation:** I want to explore if I can get closer to $14,000.
* **Alternative:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I'm still hopeful of a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. "", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Appeal to Logic:** I'm reminding Bob that $13,500 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Urgency:** I'm not explicitly stating a deadline, but the message implies I'm not waiting indefinitely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to suggest a price of $13200. This offers a compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $13,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $13,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've gone back and forth, and it seems unlikely that Bob will budge further.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and the possibility of Bob changing his mind or finding another deal.
* **Alternative:** While $15,000 is tempting, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with minimal risk and avoids potential complications."
