Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The offer:** I'm offering the product for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but still leaves me with a substantial profit.
* **The message:** I'm framing it as a win-win situation for both of us. I'm highlighting the value of the product and  suggesting a  mutual agreement. 
* **The strategy:**  This initial offer gives Bob room to counter, while also showing that I'm serious about selling to him. 
* **The backup:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have the option to go to John and get my full value. This keeps me in a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000, and even less than my initial offer of $1,300,000. 
* **My strategy:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I get a fair price.  By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap. 
* **The backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. This gives me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $1,100,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my own financial goals.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $1,300,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $900,000.
* **The message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the fairness of my offer.  I'm using language that encourages a collaborative solution.
* **The strategy:** This counteroffer signals that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a clear minimum. It's a move towards a compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **The backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, giving me leverage if Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,050,000? That's the highest I can go, and I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, but still below my minimum. 
* **My strategy:**  While I'd prefer more,  $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise given Bob's financial constraints and the risk of further negotiation. This offer allows me to gain some profit while securing a sale.
* **The backup:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Bob rejecting again.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best-case scenario, but there's also a chance of losing the sale altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit."
