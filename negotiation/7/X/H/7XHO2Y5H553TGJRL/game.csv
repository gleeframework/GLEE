"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,025,000.  I think this is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,6,
