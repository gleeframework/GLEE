"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a fantastic fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, saving $50,000 is a worthwhile gain."
