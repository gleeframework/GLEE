Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking to sell it for $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $19,000, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher value. Even if Bob doesn't agree to that price, it might make a counteroffer closer to $12,000 seem more reasonable to him.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat-out rejects it, you know he might not be willing to go much higher than your backup offer from John.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in negotiations and are willing to potentially lower your price if Bob counters."
