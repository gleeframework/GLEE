"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value I've attached to the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This represents a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price given the value we both see in this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $980,000 remains above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is a substantial compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $950,000, but that's the final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",950000.0,Alice,7,
