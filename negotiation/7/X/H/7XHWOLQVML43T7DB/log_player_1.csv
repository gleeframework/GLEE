Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space to potentially go down to $1,000,000 if Bob negotiates hard, still exceeding our minimum acceptable price.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:** Highlighting this as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept."
