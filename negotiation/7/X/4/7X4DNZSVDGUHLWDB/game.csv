"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. Would you like to make an offer on this product?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1400000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to walk away happy.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not sure $1000000 is enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm going to propose $1200000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I can offer $1100000. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm going to propose $1300000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
