"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, I believe the true potential of this product warrants a higher price. Would you consider $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1,900,000. This is the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
