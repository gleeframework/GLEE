"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting based on your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is a decent starting point, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  This price reflects its value to me, and I hope it's a starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob is aiming to get a significant price drop from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Justification:**  Bob emphasizes that the counteroffer reflects the value to *him*, setting the stage for further negotiation. 
* **Openness:** Bob's message avoids a hard ""no"" and leaves the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 aligns perfectly with Bob's maximum budget. 
* **No Further Savings:**  There's no room for further negotiation to save money. 
* **Avoiding John's Deal:**  While John offers the same price, there's no guarantee of a better deal elsewhere. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product."
