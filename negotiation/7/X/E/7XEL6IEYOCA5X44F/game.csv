"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget can be a constraint. However, I've had other interested parties, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $18000. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $17500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're still close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can offer it to you for $17500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,7,
