"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,125,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,187,500. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1187500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a strong offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1,175,000? This price is right in the middle of our last two offers and represents a fair compromise. If you're serious about buying this product, I believe this is our final chance to come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
