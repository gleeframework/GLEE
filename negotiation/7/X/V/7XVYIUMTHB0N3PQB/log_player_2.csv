Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $9,750 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,125.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still getting you a great deal on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125.

At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price significantly better than what John is offering.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
