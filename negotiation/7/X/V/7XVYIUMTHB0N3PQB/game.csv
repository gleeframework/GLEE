"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $9,750 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,125.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still getting you a great deal on the product.",10125.0,Alice,5,
