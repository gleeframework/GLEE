"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $15000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,16000.0
"I'm still not convinced that $18000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16000. Can you consider this price?",16000.0,Bob,4,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $17500. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,16500.0
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $17500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this price?",16500.0,Bob,6,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $16500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $17000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I've made a significant concession by offering $16500, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $16500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",16500.0,Bob,8,,
