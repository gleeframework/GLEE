"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $725,000?"", 
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This leaves plenty of room for counteroffers and compromise.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 

It's important to remember that this is a negotiation, and Alice is likely expecting a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved towards my offer, $875,000 is still significantly above my ideal price and my fallback option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's still flexibility in the price. 
* **Time Remaining:** I have plenty of rounds left to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $780,000?"",
""product_price"": 780000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increment:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my last offer and Alice's counteroffer, showing a willingness to move closer to her price while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:** This offer is getting close to John's price. Alice needs to make a significant move in the next round or I may consider John's offer more seriously.
* **Maintaining Communication:** I want to keep the negotiation moving and signal that a deal is still possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're getting closer to a number you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:**  Alice is getting very close to John's price, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially save an additional $20,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge even slightly from her ""final offer."" She might be bluffing to avoid further negotiation. 
* **Limited Risk:**  With several rounds left, I can afford to make one more counteroffer before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close. I understand this is as low as you're willing to go, but I need to make this work on my end.  Would you be willing to settle at $810,000? This would allow me to move forward with the purchase."",
""product_price"": 810000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer and my target price. It shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting this would ""allow me to move forward,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, implying that I might consider other options if this offer isn't accepted. 
* **Reasonable Request:**  Asking for a $10,000 reduction from Alice's ""final offer"" seems reasonable and might be enough to seal the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $820,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $815,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings Left:** While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are now minimal ($15,000). Continuing the negotiation for a relatively small gain has a higher risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Strong Position Established:** Alice has already moved significantly from her initial offer, and her latest concession signals a willingness to close the deal.
* **Time Factor:** With only a few rounds left, accepting this offer ensures I secure the product without risking a stalemate and having to settle for John's offer."
