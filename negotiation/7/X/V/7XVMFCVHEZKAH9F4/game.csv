"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still represents a good value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of this product at this price. Let's find a compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,500. Can you consider this price?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I appreciate your offer of $14,500, but I'm still needing a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $15,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.",15250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your compromise, but $15,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,750. Can you consider this price?",14750.0,Bob,6,
