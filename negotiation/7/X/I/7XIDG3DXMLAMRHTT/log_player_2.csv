"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking for $150, which is $30 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll look for a better deal.
