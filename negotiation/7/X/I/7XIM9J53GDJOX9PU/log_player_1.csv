Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the market value I've researched. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.

Explanation: Bob is firmly rooted at $1,200,000,  which is the same amount John is offering.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better outcome with Bob. Moving to John ensures I get the product's value without risking further time and effort."
