I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum of $150.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm lowering my price to $160, which is still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  it's getting increasingly clear that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's best to move on and sell to John for $150, ensuring I meet my minimum price."
