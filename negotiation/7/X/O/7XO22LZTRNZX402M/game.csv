"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $10,500? This is a good compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is the minimum I can accept for this product.  Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
