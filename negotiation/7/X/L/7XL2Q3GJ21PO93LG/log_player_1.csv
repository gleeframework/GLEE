"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $15,000 to $13,000, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$11,000 is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I believe there's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $12,500. This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum and believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting his offers, as I'm running out of time to get a better price. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower price."
