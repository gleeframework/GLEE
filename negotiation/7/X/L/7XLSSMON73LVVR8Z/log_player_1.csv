Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000. We want to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay to maximize our profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with an offer slightly below your guaranteed price ($9,500) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Urgency (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, the fact that we have another buyer lined up implies a degree of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
