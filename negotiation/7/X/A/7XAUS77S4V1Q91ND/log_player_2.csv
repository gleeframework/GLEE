{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a good price, he can potentially do better. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,100,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, given the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,087,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can close the deal on this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target price, but $1,087,500 is still above his maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make one more counteroffer and potentially reach a price he's comfortable with.  If Alice rejects his counteroffer, he can always buy from John."
