Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** While John offers $150, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if we make slightly less."
