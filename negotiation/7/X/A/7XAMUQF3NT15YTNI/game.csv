"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10500.  This is a fair compromise and would allow me to purchase the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
