"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're looking to save as much money as possible and $15,000 is well above your $10,000 limit. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and hopefully negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm starting with a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also sets a clear boundary.
* **Message:** The message is polite and maintains interest. It explains why the counteroffer is lower. 
* **Price:**  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's below my maximum but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down in price, but $12,000 is still higher than my maximum.
* I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my $10,000 limit.
* Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise and would allow me to purchase the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes a fair compromise and focuses on the value to both parties.
* **Price:** $10,500 is within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
