"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $800,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup some of the value of this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $900,000 is quite high for me. I would like to propose $850,000 as a counteroffer. This is a significant improvement over my previous offer, and I hope it will be more in line with what you're looking for.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $860,000 as a counteroffer. This is a step towards meeting you halfway, while still ensuring that I receive a reasonable value for my budget constraints.",860000.0,Bob,6,
