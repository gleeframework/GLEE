"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a product worth $800,000 to you for a lower price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
