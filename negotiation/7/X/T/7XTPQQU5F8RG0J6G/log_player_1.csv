"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation to meet Bob's value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my target price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not willing to settle for that price.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. Selling to John is still an option if things don't improve, but I'm hoping I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal and it will encourage him to come up in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting too low and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds."
