Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal for you, as you've mentioned you value it at $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you room to make a profit. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you don't immediately undervalue your product.
* **It shows flexibility:** The message shows that you're open to negotiating and willing to work with Bob.

This strategy allows for a potential win-win scenario where you earn more than Bob's value and Bob gets a good deal. Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiations and potentially get closer to your target price. You can use Bob's offer as a starting point for your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,800 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,150?  This way, we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that you're serious about making a deal.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason (meeting in the middle) makes your counteroffer sound more logical and fair. 
* **Staying above your minimum:** You're still above your minimum price, but leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $10,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiations and potentially get closer to your target price. You can use Bob's offer as a starting point for your counteroffer.  Since John is willing to pay your minimum, you can still sell to him if you're unable to reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try one more time to find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I really want to work this out with you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer shows a strong commitment to finalizing a deal with Bob.
* **Reasoning:**  The message highlights the mutual benefit of the offer, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Close to minimum:**  The price is just above your minimum, leaving little room for further negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can confidently sell to John for your minimum price, knowing you tried your best to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $10,800. I'm really close to my budget, and I'd like to stay within it. Can you consider this offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer is still below your minimum, and you've already made significant concessions.  At this point, continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better result. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose out on a good deal."
