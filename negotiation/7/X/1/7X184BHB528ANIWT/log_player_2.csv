"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $130. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer than Alice's initial price.  This shows that he's serious about negotiating a better price. Offering $130 is still a fair price for Alice, as it's above her minimum value of $120. This gives Alice room to bargain, but also sets a strong starting point for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down a bit to $135.  I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price.  While there's a chance he could negotiate a slightly lower price, there's also a risk of Alice rejecting further offers or the negotiation taking longer.  Accepting the offer at $135 ensures Bob gets the product and saves $15 compared to buying from John."
