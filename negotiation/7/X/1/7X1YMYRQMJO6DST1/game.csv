"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750000 is simply too low. My minimum price is $850000. This still represents a significant value for you, as you've stated the product is worth $1000000 to you. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
