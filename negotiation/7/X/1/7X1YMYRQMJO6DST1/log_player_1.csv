"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. My minimum price is $850,000. This still represents a significant value for you, as you've stated the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a good deal considering the limited time and the potential for further negotiation breakdown. Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of getting a lower price from John or further negotiation with Bob."
