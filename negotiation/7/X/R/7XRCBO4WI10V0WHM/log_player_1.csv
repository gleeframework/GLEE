Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. However, I still feel that $875,000 is a bit too high for me. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John ($800,000). There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better price. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further."
