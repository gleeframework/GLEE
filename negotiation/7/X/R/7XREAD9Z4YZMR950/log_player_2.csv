"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,300,000.  This is more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should offer $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is halfway between his maximum price ($1,200,000) and Alice's initial offer ($1,300,000). It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum price. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating.  He can try a counteroffer closer to his maximum price, or potentially consider buying from John if further negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a better result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $1,275,000. This is a compromise, showing that he is willing to move but still wants to keep the price below his maximum. This may be enough to entice Alice to consider accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  It seems unlikely that Alice will come down to a price Bob is willing to pay, especially since she's already rejected his counteroffers.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000 and save himself further negotiation and potential risk of the deal falling through."
