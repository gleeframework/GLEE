"Hey Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $75 right now.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, given your enthusiasm.  Let's meet in the middle.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
