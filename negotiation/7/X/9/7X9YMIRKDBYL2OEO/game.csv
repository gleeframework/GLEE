"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
