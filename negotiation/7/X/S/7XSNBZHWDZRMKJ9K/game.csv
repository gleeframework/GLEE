"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this product is a great opportunity for me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. However, I need to stay within my budget, and $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This price still leaves you with a considerable profit margin, while allowing me to get closer to my desired value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Can you consider this offer?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
