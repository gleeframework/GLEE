Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so he might be willing to negotiate.
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price:** My minimum is $1,000,000. If Bob rejects, I still have John willing to pay that.

This allows me to potentially secure a higher price than I would with John, while also leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
