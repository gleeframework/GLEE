Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of potential compromise on my part. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""special price,"" ""limited time"") can make it seem less arbitrary and more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is friendly and invites Bob's input, signaling my willingness to negotiate. 

**My Strategy:**

My plan is to gradually decrease my asking price in response to Bob's counteroffers, but never go below my minimum of $120.  I'll gauge Bob's eagerness and carefully consider if it's worth continuing the negotiation or taking the guaranteed $120 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased significantly, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. He's also indicated he's interested and on a tight budget, suggesting he might be willing to go higher. 

**Next Step:** I will counter with an offer slightly above my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just too low for me.  Could you do $130?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and constraints while standing firm on a price slightly above my minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Presenting this as my ""final offer"" aims to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a price higher than he might otherwise be willing to pay.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is now closer to my minimum, but still gives me a small buffer for potential further negotiation if Bob comes back with another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm really interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product provides. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum price of $120. His latest offer of $110, while closer, is still a loss for me.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $120, which meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Negotiation:**  Bob has stated that $110 is ""the lowest I can go,"" indicating further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful.

**Conclusion:** It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed profit with John."
