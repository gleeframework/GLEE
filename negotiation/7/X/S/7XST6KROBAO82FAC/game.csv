"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just too low for me.  Could you do $130?  That's my final offer.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm really interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product provides.",110.0,Bob,4,
