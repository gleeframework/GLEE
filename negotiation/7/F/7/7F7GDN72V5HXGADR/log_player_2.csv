"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and I'm sure it will be highly valuable for your business.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  How about we start at a significantly lower price, say $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me. I understand you have a budget to work with, but this product is truly valuable. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This still gives you a substantial saving while ensuring I can make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to a reasonable price. However, $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be frank, I've got another offer on the table that's significantly less than what you're proposing.  If you can come down to $950,000, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer but we're still not quite there. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need you to come down a bit more for this to make sense for me. How about $1,025,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I believe this product is worth more to you than you're currently proposing. This is my final offer: $1,050,000.  It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit, while still giving you a valuable product at a reasonable cost. If you don't accept this offer, I'll be moving on to my other buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm, and her final offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget and your alternative offer from John. While you might be able to squeeze a few thousand dollars more out of Alice, it's not worth the risk of her walking away. You've made it clear you have another option, and sticking to your guns secures you the best possible price."
