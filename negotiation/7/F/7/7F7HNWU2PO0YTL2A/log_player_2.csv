"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that's worth a great deal to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
