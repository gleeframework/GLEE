Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to go as low as $1,050,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're getting close, but we're still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer $1,125,000. This is our final offer, and we're confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while I'd prefer to pay less, I'm getting closer to my desired price point.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, Alice will stick to her price, and I may be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's within my budget."
