"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **You have a better alternative:** John will sell you the product for $100.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Alice is starting at $90, which is higher than your maximum price and significantly higher than her own value for the product. There's a good chance you can get a better price from her if you reject this initial offer."
