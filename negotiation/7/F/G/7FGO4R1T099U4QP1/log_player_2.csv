"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still leaves room for negotiation.**  $900,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price. 
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000. This is still a significant profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget and a good deal.** $850,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.** You could try for a lower price, but Alice might reject your offer again, wasting time and potentially leading to a deal with John at a higher price. 
* **Accepting this offer provides a good balance of savings and certainty.**  It secures the product at a price you're comfortable with, and avoids the risk of a more prolonged negotiation."
