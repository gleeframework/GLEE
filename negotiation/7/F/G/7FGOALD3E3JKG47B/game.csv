"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a substantial discount and gives you a great deal, but it's also a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
