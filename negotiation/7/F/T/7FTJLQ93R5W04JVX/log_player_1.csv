"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This initial offer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than my minimum value of $150, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.  I'm hoping to strike a deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $115? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $115. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  Bob seems firm on his offer and I've already had a couple of rounds of negotiation. Accepting his offer at $110 ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or Bob walking away completely."
