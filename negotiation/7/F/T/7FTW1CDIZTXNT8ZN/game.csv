"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $700000 at this time. This is a fair price for a product that I value at under $800000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to me is at least $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my own value assessment and your desire to sell. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850000 is still a bit below your initial offer of $1100000, but I'm willing to compromise further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm thinking of a price of $950000, which is a $150000 discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. Given my budget and my valuation of the product, I'm offering $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal with a little more compromise.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm thinking of a price of $925000. This is a compromise that's close to your offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close to a deal.  I'm prepared to offer $910000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $910000. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $915000. This is a small increase from your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",915000.0,Alice,9,
