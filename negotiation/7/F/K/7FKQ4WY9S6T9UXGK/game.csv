"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price is a fair compromise and allows us to move forward with the deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to considering $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I can offer you a price of $825,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is tempting, but I need to stay closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $780,000? I think that's a fair offer that works well for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line. I can offer you a price of $812,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my final offer, so I expect you to make a serious decision.",812500.0,Alice,7,
