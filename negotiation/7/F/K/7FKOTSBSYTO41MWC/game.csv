"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering. However, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us and we could finalise the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price.  Let's try one more time - I'll come down to $10,900. That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10900.0,Alice,5,
