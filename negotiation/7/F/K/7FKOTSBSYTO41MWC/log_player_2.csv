"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better by negotiating. There are still 9 rounds left, which is ample time to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering. However, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by making a significant step towards Bob's desired price point of $10,000. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also that he's willing to negotiate.  It's a reasonable starting point that gives Alice room to counter without feeling like Bob is being unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than the initial offer, Bob can still potentially do better. He's still $1,000 above his target price of $10,000, and there are still 7 rounds left.  The negotiation process is working, and continuing to counteroffer is likely to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us and we could finalise the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a compromise. It shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate and is serious about getting the product.  Meeting in the middle at $10,750 is a fair offer that keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price.  Let's try one more time - I'll come down to $10,900. That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and Bob is only $900 away from his target price. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing and needing to buy from John at $12,000 is increasing.  Accepting the offer at $10,900  is the most logical choice to secure the product at a good price."
