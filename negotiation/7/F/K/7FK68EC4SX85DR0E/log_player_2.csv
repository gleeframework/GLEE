{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is within my budget and represents a decent compromise.  While I would prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling through entirely and forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's time to accept the offer and move forward."
