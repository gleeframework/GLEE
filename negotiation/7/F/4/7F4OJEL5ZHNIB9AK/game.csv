"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,500,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep, but $900,000 is a bit too low for my liking. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
