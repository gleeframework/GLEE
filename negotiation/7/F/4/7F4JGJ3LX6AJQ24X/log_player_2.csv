Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $10000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $13000 for a final offer.

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still outside my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a price that works for both of us. There are still several rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up yet."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $11000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000, which is my final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than my preferred price. With only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better deal.  Buying from John for $8,000 is the most sensible option, as it ensures I get the product within my budget and avoid further negotiation."
