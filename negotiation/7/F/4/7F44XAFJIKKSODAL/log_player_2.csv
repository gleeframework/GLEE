"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much better to try negotiating a lower price, aiming to get closer to $100.  We always have the option to buy from John for $100 if negotiations go poorly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I do like the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation but also signals that we're serious about a lower price point.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important for keeping the conversation going smoothly. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We always have the option to buy from John for $100 if Alice completely rejects our attempts to reach a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, which is good. However, we're still only $5 away from John's price. It's worth seeing if we can get Alice closer to $100, especially since we have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** Alice came down $5, so we're reciprocating with a $5 decrease from our previous offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency (Subtle):**  We haven't explicitly mentioned John's offer, but every round that passes brings us closer to potentially taking that deal. This creates some subtle time pressure for Alice to work with us.
* **Seeking a Favorable Outcome:**  Ideally, we want to land somewhere between $90 and $95.  This would be a significant saving compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's fallback price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can offer you the product for $100. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our alternative option. There's no point in trying to negotiate further, as we are unlikely to get a better price. Accepting this offer ensures we get the product at the best possible price."
