"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to me ($150), but lower than what I think it's worth to Bob ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects my offer.  I'm also using friendly language to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still too low. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm also starting to feel the pressure of time, so I'll need to be more assertive in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $130 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm sticking to my bottom line of $150, but I'm willing to come down a little bit more to make the deal more appealing to Bob. I'm also reminding him that this is a fair deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd be willing to pay $135 for it. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm starting to run out of time and Bob isn't willing to come up to my minimum price of $150.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll sell the product to him and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
