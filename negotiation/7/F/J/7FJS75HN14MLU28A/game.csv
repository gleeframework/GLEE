"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Can we meet in the middle again?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $130 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd be willing to pay $135 for it. Can we meet in the middle again?",135.0,Bob,6,
