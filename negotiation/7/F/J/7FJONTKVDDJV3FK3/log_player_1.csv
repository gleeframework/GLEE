Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a significant amount above Bob's perceived value, giving me a good starting point. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my desired value through negotiation, but I'm also aware that John is a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I'm confident that I can convince him to pay closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still closer to my desired value than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so far below my worth.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
