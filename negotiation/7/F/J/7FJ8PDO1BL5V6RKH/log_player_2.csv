# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  While I appreciate your offer to split the difference, $825,000 is still cutting it too close to my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer.

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000, and you have a guaranteed option at $800,000 with John. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the best deal."
