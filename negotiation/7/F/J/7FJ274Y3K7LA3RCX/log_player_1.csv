Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $17,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high offer will gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you have room to work with. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your minimum price or John's offer. If he did, your negotiation strategy would need to be adjusted."
