"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. This price still represents significant value for you, considering your estimated worth of $1,000,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
