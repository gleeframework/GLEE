"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'd like to try to get as close to the market price as possible.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $150? That's fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",150.0,Alice,3,
