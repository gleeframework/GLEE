"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180, given its value. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $150 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I can go up to $70, but that's my limit.  What do you think?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some potential for us to make a deal here.  $70 is too low, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is my final offer, so what do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I could potentially stretch to $75, but that's really the absolute maximum I can do.  Do you think we can make this work?",75.0,Bob,6,
