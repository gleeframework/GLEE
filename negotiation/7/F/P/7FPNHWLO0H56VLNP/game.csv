"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I think that's a fair compromise.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $9,000? This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I appreciate you coming down to $9,000. To be honest, I have a budget of $8,500 for this.  If you're okay with that, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I might need to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,6,
