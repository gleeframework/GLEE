"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better for Bob to buy from John at $10,000, as that's the best possible price for him."
