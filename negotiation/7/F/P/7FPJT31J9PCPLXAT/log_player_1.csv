Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the deal for both of us emphasizes mutual benefit and encourages acceptance. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. 
* If the negotiation stalls or becomes unproductive, I'll move on to John, ensuring I receive my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum desired value of $15,000.**  I am not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative with John.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain my negotiating position.**  By rejecting, I show that I am not desperate to sell at a low price and can potentially secure a better deal in subsequent rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* **I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value.**  I want to see if I can get him closer to my minimum, or at least push the negotiation towards a more acceptable range. 
* **If the negotiation stalls or Bob refuses to budge, I will move to sell to John.** I am not afraid to walk away if I cannot achieve a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a better price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the $11,250 price as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to consider it.
* **Maintain Value:**  $11,250 is still above Bob's initial offer, keeping the value close to my desired minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price.**
* **If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and assess whether it's worth pursuing further.**
* **If Bob refuses to budge or the negotiations stall, I'll sell to John and secure my minimum desired value.**"
