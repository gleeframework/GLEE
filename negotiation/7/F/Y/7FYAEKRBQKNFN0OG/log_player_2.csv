"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal from Alice.  While $1,000,000 is less than buying from John, you have room to negotiate and potentially get the price lower.  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but it makes sense to try and get the price down further before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal quickly. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This allows you to get the product at a good price, while still giving me a reasonable return.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, you are still within your budget and can potentially get a better deal.  You are willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's still room for negotiation to get closer to your target of $900,000.  It's worth pushing to see if Alice will budge further before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a fair price, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference this time? I'm willing to come down to $937,500. This ensures both of us get a good deal, and allows us to move forward quickly.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  You are within your budget and have the option of buying from John for a higher price.  At this point, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
