{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it at $120. This is way over my budget.  I will reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

I'm raising my offer slightly to $95, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but still trying to stay within my budget.  Hopefully, this is enough to convince her to make a deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $100 is still higher than my budget. Although it is closer to my desired price than her previous offers, I have already spent several rounds trying to negotiate.  I am now at the point where it makes sense to go with John's offer, which is within my budget."
