Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $11,250 offer secures a good deal for Bob, saving him $3,750 compared to John's price."
