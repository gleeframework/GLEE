"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!",11250.0,Alice,5,
