"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I've set the opening price at $1,100,000. I believe this reflects the immense value it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Confident Tone:** My message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly reinforcing its worth to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the starting price is high, the phrasing implies a willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while being mindful of the alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to counter to try and close the gap between his offer and my desired selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations in terms of value. To move things forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've come down from my initial offer by $75,000, while Bob increased his by $125,000. This signals willingness to negotiate but keeps us closer to my target price. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to justify the higher price point.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):** By saying ""to move things forward,"" I subtly remind Bob that we have a limited number of rounds. This could encourage him to make a more competitive offer sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  To be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but Bob's latest increase was only $50,000. This suggests there might be some room for negotiation. While I risk pushing him too far, I'll counteroffer one more time to try and secure a higher price. I'm willing to accept a smaller profit margin than initially hoped to avoid selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal.  I'm prepared to make this my final offer.  If you're truly serious about acquiring this product, I'm willing to agree to $980,000.  This represents a significant discount on its true value, and I believe it's more than fair."",
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making it clear this is my best and final offer, introducing a sense of urgency. 
* **Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the ""discount"" Bob would receive while highlighting that I'm making a concession.
* **Balance:**  This offer aims for a price point that is appealing to Bob (significantly closer to his offer) while still securing a healthy profit margin for myself. 

By setting this as my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision. This approach balances risk and potential reward."
