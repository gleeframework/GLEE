"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's highly likely that Alice is willing to sell for less than $500,000 since she's trying to make a sale. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $300,000. This is a bold move, but it signals my strong desire to get a good deal. If Alice rejects this offer, it tells me she's likely willing to negotiate further, and I can adjust my counteroffers based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, showing a willingness to negotiate. However,  $400,000 is still too high.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $350,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good price.  It's a middle ground between my previous offer and her latest offer, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $450,000 is still too expensive. I'm going to reject the offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a price we both agree on. If she rejects this final counteroffer, I'll buy from John as the risk of getting a lower price from Alice is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm raising my price to $400,000, which is closer to Alice's latest offer.  This shows good faith in the negotiation. If she rejects this offer, I'll accept John's offer since the potential gains of continuing with Alice are outweighed by the risk of failing to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $475,000 is still too high for me.  While I'm not sure if I could get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement is too great.  It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000 rather than risk losing the opportunity entirely."
