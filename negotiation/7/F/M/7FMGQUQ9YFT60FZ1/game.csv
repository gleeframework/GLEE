"Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my understanding of the market value and my own budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is closer to its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the sale.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
