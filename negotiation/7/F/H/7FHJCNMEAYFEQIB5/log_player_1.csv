Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has John as a backup.

**The Sweet Spot:** Alice needs to offer a price that's enticing to Bob (higher than his perceived value of $10,000) but also maximizes her profit.

**The Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique features, I'm valuing it at $11,500.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value proposition. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Why this works:**

* **Higher than Bob's Value:** The price of $11,500 is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, creating a sense of potential gain if he accepts.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a public listing implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act now.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $11,500 is a strong starting point, there's a slight buffer for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might counter, or he might decline outright. However, this offer gives Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit before moving on to John."
