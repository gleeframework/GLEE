Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it to you considering the value you place on it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're not walking away with less than your minimum, even if Bob accepts the first offer.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows you to potentially reach a price closer to your goal of $15,000.

By starting with this offer, you create a negotiation that balances your need for profit with the need to keep Bob engaged and potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there any room for negotiation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you and what you could potentially get from John.  It's worthwhile to see if you can get closer to your desired price by counteroffering."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9800. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still quite a bit lower than your desired price.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can bridge the gap.  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you'll have to decide between selling to John for $15,000 or taking the lower price from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,800 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a significant compromise, and I hope it's something you can work with.  If not, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9200. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While it's tempting to try one more counteroffer,  it's clear that Bob and you are too far apart in price.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and sell to John for $15,000.  You'll get a much better price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could potentially lead to a lower offer."
