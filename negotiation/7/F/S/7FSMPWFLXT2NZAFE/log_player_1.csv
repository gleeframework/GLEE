Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly below my bottom line. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. While $130 is still a little too steep for me, I could go up to $70.  Do you think that would work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $70 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand this is your final offer, but $110 is just a bit too far out of my price range.  I'd be happy to meet you halfway at $90.  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in very small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to your $120 guarantee with John in the remaining rounds.  It's strategically wiser to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
