{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a great deal to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $900,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a win-win opportunity and emphasizing the value Bob would gain. 
* **Negotiation stance:** I'm setting a clear lower limit, but also indicating openness to discussion.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate down.
* **Maintain control:** Setting a lower limit keeps me in a strong position.
* **Encourage Bob to counter:** I want him to make the first move, giving me information about his willingness to pay.

This is just the first move in the negotiation. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response,  keeping in mind the value of the product to me and my fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000? It's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept,  I'm confident in my fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Showing I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Control the negotiation:**  I'll now make a counteroffer, potentially influencing the outcome.
* **Explore a better price:**  There's a chance I can negotiate with Bob closer to my target price.

I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm still open to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a compromise. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counteroffer of $850,000 is a compromise. It's halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. This shows flexibility while still keeping my minimum price in mind. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate that it's too low. I frame the counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both of us. 
* **Negotiation stance:** I'm remaining firm on my minimum price but expressing openness to further discussion. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without appearing inflexible.

This strategy aims to:

* **Signal seriousness:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and have a clear understanding of the product's value.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  The compromise offer encourages Bob to reconsider and potentially meet me halfway.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  While $850,000 is below my initial goal, it's still a significant amount.

I'll continue to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses. My goal is to maximize my profit while maintaining the possibility of a successful transaction with Bob.  Remember, I have John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $750,000? I feel that's a strong offer, and it avoids me having to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it's still not a deal that provides me with sufficient value.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Showing I'm not desperate for a quick sale and have a clear understanding of the product's value.
* **Control the negotiation:**  I'll now make a counteroffer, potentially influencing the outcome.
* **Explore a better price:**  There's still a chance I can negotiate with Bob closer to my target price.

I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'm confident in my fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counteroffer of $800,000 is a compromise. It's halfway between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000. This shows flexibility while still keeping my minimum price in mind.

* **Negotiation stance:** I'm remaining firm on my minimum price but expressing openness to a final compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without appearing inflexible.

This strategy aims to:

* **Signal seriousness:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and have a clear understanding of the product's value.
* **Encourage a final agreement:**  The compromise offer encourages Bob to reconsider and potentially meet me halfway.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  While $800,000 is still below my initial goal, it's a significant amount.  It's also a price that is reasonable considering Bob's valuation.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will proceed to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. I'm willing to take the risk of losing Bob as a buyer, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product."
