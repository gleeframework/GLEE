"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a great deal to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000? It's a fair price that benefits us both.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm still open to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a compromise. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $750,000? I feel that's a strong offer, and it avoids me having to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. Let's settle at $800,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
