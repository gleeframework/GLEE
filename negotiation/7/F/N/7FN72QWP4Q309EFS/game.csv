"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $105. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a little more than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to go up to $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on this.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $110. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $112. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
