{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and her offer is $180.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying within my comfortable spending limit.  This also allows for potential compromise on Alice's part."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can do $145 for the product. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. "", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal but also signals that I'm close to my limit.  This pressure might push her to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $145 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I can do $142 for the product. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but $142 is still outside of my comfortable spending range.  I'm not willing to spend that much, and I still have time left to negotiate. I'll make one last counteroffer before deciding if it's worth buying from John."

```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final push. I'm offering a price that's just below Alice's offer but still within my budget.  I'm putting the pressure on Alice to make a decision, as I'm only two rounds away from buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $138 is your final offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low.
