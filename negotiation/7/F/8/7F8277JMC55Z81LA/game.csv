"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $110?  This still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's a price I can live with.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",90.0,Bob,4,
