"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it is closer to his budget, $16,000 is still a bit high. It is worth trying to negotiate further, especially since he has a guaranteed alternative with John for $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $16000. I'll meet you halfway again, but this is my final concession. I'll offer you the product for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $15,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his comfort zone.  It's better for Bob to stick to his goal of spending no more than $12,000. He knows he can get the product from John at that price, making it the most logical choice."
