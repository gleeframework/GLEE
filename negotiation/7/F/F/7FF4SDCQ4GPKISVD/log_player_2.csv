# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

$100 is still over your limit,  you should reject and counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $100 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $90. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, so I'm offering it to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still too high. You should buy from John for $80.  You've already gone through 5 rounds and it's unlikely Alice will come down to your price."
