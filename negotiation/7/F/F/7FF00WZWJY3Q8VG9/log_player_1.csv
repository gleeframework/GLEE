Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **50% Markup:**  The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and your belief in the offered price. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, the goal is to maximize profit. Don't be afraid to negotiate with Bob if he counters, but hold firm to a price that's significantly above your $1,500,000 minimum."
