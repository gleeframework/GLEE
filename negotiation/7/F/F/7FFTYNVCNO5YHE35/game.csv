"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle again at $102.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
