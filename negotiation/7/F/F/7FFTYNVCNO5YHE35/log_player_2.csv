"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is offering a price lower than her value, which is a good sign. However, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great. However, I'm on a bit of a budget right now.  Would you consider a lower price, like $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to get the best possible deal, so starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($90) gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message remains friendly and explains the counteroffer with a budget constraint, making it seem more reasonable to Alice. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer is still low enough that we have room to negotiate upwards if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway towards our initial counteroffer. However, we're still in the early rounds and have room to push for a better price. We'll try to edge closer to our target price without being too aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $100 is closer, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget.  Could we maybe do $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving in small increments ($5) to show Alice we're interested but still want a lower price.
* **Reinforcing Budget:** By mentioning the budget again, we maintain a reason for our counteroffers.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much further Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle again at $102.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in smaller increments now, which suggests we're getting closer to her limit. However, it's still worth pushing a bit further.  We're more than halfway through the negotiation rounds, so we need to start being more assertive while still aiming for a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle at $98? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 98
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, so we're injecting a sense of urgency to encourage Alice to agree.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that feels fair to both sides. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Final Offer Tone:** The language suggests this is our final offer, encouraging Alice to accept it rather than risk the deal falling through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as high as $98. How about we meet in the middle again at $101? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is barely budging on the price now, indicating we're unlikely to get a significantly better deal. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're running out of rounds, and continuing to negotiate risks missing out on the deal altogether.
* **Acceptable Price:**  $101 is a reasonable price and a significant saving from both Alice's initial offer and John's price. 

It's time to accept the offer and secure a good deal rather than risking losing it by pushing too hard."
