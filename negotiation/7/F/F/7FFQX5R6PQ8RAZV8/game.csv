"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This would give us both a fair deal and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
