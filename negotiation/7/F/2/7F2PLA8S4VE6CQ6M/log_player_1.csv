Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product has for Bob. This sets the stage for a potential compromise.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counteroffer.

**Note:** This is just the first offer.  I will adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to make a counteroffer of $820000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $820,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I have 9 rounds left, which is enough time to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **Not a significant gap:** The difference between Bob's offer and my minimum is not huge. This suggests there's potential for a deal with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer closer to my target price, hoping to find a compromise with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the value this product brings you. How about $880,000?  It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 880000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer than my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:** $880,000 is above my minimum price of $800,000, ensuring I don't settle for less than what I'm comfortable with.
* **Highlighting value again:** I remind Bob of the product's value, reinforcing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. Depending on his reaction, I will decide whether to continue negotiating or move towards selling to John if the price doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counteroffer at $860000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $860,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Closing the gap:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's not yet at a point where I'm comfortable accepting.
* **Opportunity to push for a better deal:** With 7 rounds remaining, there's still potential for a better offer, and I want to avoid settling too early. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price closer to $880,000 in the next round. The gap between Bob's offer and my counteroffer will be smaller, making it more likely for him to accept."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. How about $870,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant value for you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** I'm offering a price that's just a bit more than Bob's previous offer, showing my willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair"" price, suggesting a mutual benefit. 
* **Creating urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's make this deal happen"" adds a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'm optimistic about this offer, as it's closer to Bob's desired price. I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider raising my offer slightly in the next round while still keeping it above my minimum."
