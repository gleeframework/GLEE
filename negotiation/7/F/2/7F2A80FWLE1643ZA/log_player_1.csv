"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's unique qualities and potential to increase the perceived value for Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.** This is not ideal, but I have 8 rounds left. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more.
* **Rejection opens the door for negotiation:** By rejecting, I can try to get a better price. 
* **John's offer is not a better option:** While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to maximize my earnings.

I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,350,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Value Reminder:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value to reinforce the justification for my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Increased Offer:** Bob has increased his offer by $50,000, which is a significant improvement from his initial offer.
* **Limited Time:** I have only 6 rounds left, and it's becoming risky to continue negotiating.
* **Better Than John's Offer:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is $50,000 higher than John's.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a higher return than selling to John."
