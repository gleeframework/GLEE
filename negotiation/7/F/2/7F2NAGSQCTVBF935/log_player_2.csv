Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

We're getting close to Alice's offer, but let's see if we can secure a price closer to our target.  This counteroffer is a modest increase, indicating our desire to find a middle ground."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice has been consistently coming down in price. While we might be able to get her slightly lower, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue. Accepting this offer ensures we get the product for a significantly lower price than John's, and it's likely we won't be able to do much better with Alice."
