Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $100 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is below Bob's value of $120, giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go up if Bob counters, but you have some room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and a good starting point for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still aim for a slightly higher price. Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is closer to what I need, but I'm willing to come down to $90 for this great product. This still leaves a good margin for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
