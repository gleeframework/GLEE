"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd be a perfect buyer. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering me as a potential buyer. I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to pay more than his perceived value of the product ($120). Since my minimum acceptable price is also $120, there's no room for profitable negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price without wasting further time on a negotiation that's unlikely to yield a better outcome."
