"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $12,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,200 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $12,400. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,400

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Accepting the $12,400 offer secures a good deal for you, saving $2,600 compared to John's price."
