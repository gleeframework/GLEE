Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my value of $1,500,000. This initial offer of $1,250,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Negotiation:** By leaving room for negotiation, I encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob doesn't meet my expectations, I can always choose to sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I achieve my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000 and also below my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation is Necessary:**  While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's initial counteroffer is too far off. There's still room to reach a mutually acceptable price through further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $1,500,000, so I can afford to be firm and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not closing the door completely. A counter-offer keeps the negotiation going and shows my willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer of $1,250,000, demonstrating flexibility, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This price allows for further negotiation but maintains a significant profit margin for me.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer and willing to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Further Negotiation:** I can still try to reach a more favorable price. I believe there's room for compromise, and I'm confident that I can secure a better price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm holding on to John's offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a safety net if I cannot agree with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort, but $950,000 is still a bit too far off.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my last offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This shows my commitment to finding a compromise while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Strong Position:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me the leverage to hold firm on my price.
* **Potential Agreement:** This counter-offer could lead to an agreement. It's a price that is likely to be acceptable to Bob, considering his previous offers, and it's still well above my minimum acceptable value."
