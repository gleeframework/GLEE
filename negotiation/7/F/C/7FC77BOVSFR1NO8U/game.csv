"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for the product. This still allows you to make a profit while keeping the cost reasonable for me. I look forward to your response.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $820,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $880,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",880000.0,Alice,3,
