"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of its value. While I would like to accommodate your offer, I must respectfully decline at this time. Our current pricing reflects the quality and uniqueness of the product. However, I am willing to consider a compromise. How about offering the product for $105?
