"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far too high, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but it's important to remember that John is a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. This product is highly valuable, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $15,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still better off purchasing from John for $10,000. It's worth continuing negotiations with Alice to see if she'll come down further, but Bob shouldn't lose sight of the fact that John is always a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both our interests to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's settle at $14,250. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. While $14,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000. There's a chance that Alice might come down further, but there's also a risk that she won't, and Bob will end up paying more than he wants. John offers a guaranteed price that fits Bob's budget."
