"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. This product is highly valuable, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both our interests to reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
