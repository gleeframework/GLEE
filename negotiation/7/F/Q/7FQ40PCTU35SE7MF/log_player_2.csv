"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time deal with you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not interested in paying $18,000 for the product. That's way above my budget of $8,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal.
