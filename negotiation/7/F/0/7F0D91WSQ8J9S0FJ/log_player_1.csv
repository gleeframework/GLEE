{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might lead to a breakdown in the deal.  Additionally, we're running out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a sale, and I'll be able to recoup most of my investment."
