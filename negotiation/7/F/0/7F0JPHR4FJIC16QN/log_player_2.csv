"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but it's likely she's willing to go lower.**  $900,000 is a significant discount from your maximum budget, but it's worth trying to negotiate further. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to explore lower prices.**  There's no need to rush into a deal, especially when you have a backup option at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. I'm very interested in the product and believe this price reflects its true value, while also being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility, but still above your ideal price.** While $775,000 is a good price, you're still within your budget and there's room for further negotiation.
* **You have more rounds left.** There's no need to rush into a deal, especially as Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **A counteroffer can still lead to a better price.**  By rejecting this offer, you can signal your continued desire for a lower price and potentially get Alice closer to your target of $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $775,000.  While that's closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'd like to offer $750,000.  This price recognizes the product's value while giving us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $765000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is unlikely to go lower.** She's already made multiple concessions and stated this is her final offer.  
* **The price is within your budget and a good deal.**  $765,000 is significantly lower than your backup price from John and provides a substantial discount from your initial target.
* **You're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.** It's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers, as you may not get a better price and risk having to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting this offer, you secure a good price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
