"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to pay closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This reflects the potential benefits I see, while still allowing you a good return. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant drop. This product has unique value that I'm confident will bring you substantial returns.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $987,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to make a profit.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000, but that's my final offer. This is a great deal for a product that can bring you substantial returns.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
