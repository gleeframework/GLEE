"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to pay closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This reflects the potential benefits I see, while still allowing you a good return. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant drop. This product has unique value that I'm confident will bring you substantial returns.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. Bob should keep negotiating to push for a lower price. There's still room for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $987,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000, but that's my final offer. This is a great deal for a product that can bring you substantial returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point.  While it's still above the $987,500 counteroffer, it's only $22,500 more.  Considering it's the fifth round and Bob has already rejected a couple of offers, it's a good time to accept.  It's also important to note that if Bob rejects, there is no guarantee that Alice will make a counteroffer.  Bob is taking a slight risk here, but the potential of closing the deal for a price within his budget outweighs the risk of getting a better offer later."
