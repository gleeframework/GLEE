"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above the product's value to her ($8,000).  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. You have a lot of room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from $15,000, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing appreciation for the lower price. Then, it states your desire for a better price. The counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you are serious about buying the product but are also trying to secure a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11000? That still leaves you a good profit margin and allows me to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  You can save $4,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still a good deal for you."
