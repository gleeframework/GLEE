"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9800. I'd like to get as close to the product's value to me as possible, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from $10200. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to $10000 as possible. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,6,
