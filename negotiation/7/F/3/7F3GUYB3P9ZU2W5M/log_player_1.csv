{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, while also ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal if he's truly interested. I'm also leaving room for a counteroffer so we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,200 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm open to negotiation.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,600?

You have three options:

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $8,600 is still below my minimum of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll counter with a price closer to $9,000 and see if we can reach a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
