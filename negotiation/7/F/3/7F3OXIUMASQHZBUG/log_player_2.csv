"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $10,000 is more than he's willing to pay, and he has the option to get the product for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,250 is closer to his ideal price, he can still get the product from John for $8,000.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000,  but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but that's my final offer.  If you're interested in making a deal, let me know, but I'm also open to considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $9,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has the opportunity to get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when a better deal is already available."
