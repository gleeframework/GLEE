"Hi Alice,  $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000,  but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to accept.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but that's my final offer.  If you're interested in making a deal, let me know, but I'm also open to considering other options.",9500.0,Alice,5,
