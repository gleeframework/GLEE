"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you consider my offer?,78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $78 is still a little below where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $81? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",81.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $81. I'm willing to pay $79 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",79.0,Bob,6,
