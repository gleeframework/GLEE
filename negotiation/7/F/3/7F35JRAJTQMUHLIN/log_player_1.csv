Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $80. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $78 is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to push for a bit more. I'm not sure how much more Bob is willing to pay, but I'll counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $78 is still a little below where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $81? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $81. I'm willing to pay $79 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm concerned Bob won't go higher than $79. While that's close to my minimum, I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing out on the deal with John.  Selling to John for $80 is the safest option and guarantees I get my minimum."
