Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can spend. How about $90?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get Bob to go a bit higher with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle at $95. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
