# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

```"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's low enough to signal that I'm looking for a good deal but not so low that it's insulting. It allows room for negotiation and hopefully finding a middle ground."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can spend. How about $90?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:I'm increasing my offer to show I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price below John's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a better deal."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle at $95. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:Alice has come down considerably, and this price is now a reasonable savings over John's offer. It's a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."")
