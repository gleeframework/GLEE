"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can spend. How about $90?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle at $95. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
