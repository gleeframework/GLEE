(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This product is above your price limit, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. We'll see if Alice is willing to come down that far."

Alice's offer is still a bit high. We can try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

This is the maximum price I'm willing to pay. If Alice doesn't accept this offer, I'll just buy from John."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to pay less, Alice's offer is within my budget and only slightly higher than John's price. To avoid the risk of losing out on the deal altogether, I'm going to accept her offer."
