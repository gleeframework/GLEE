"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500, but that's my final offer. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $8,250. Can you consider that?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While I value your business, $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,375? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product.",8375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $8,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,375, but I'm still a bit below my target.",8200.0,Bob,6,
