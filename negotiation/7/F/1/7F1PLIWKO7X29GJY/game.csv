"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm starting with a price of $20000, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16000.  Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $10000. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $13000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go to $11000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $12000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $11000.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.  Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer.",11000.0,Bob,8,
