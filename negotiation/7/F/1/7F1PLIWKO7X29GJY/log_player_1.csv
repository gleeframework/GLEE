Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm starting with a price of $20,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $8000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $10000. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll see if I can get Bob closer to my target by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $13,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go to $11000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not quite ready to give up, and I believe I can still get a better offer. I'll make another counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $12,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $11000.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.  Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only a couple of rounds left, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price. It's getting close, but I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk losing out on any deal at all."
