Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect, making it appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a high price initially, I'm hoping to push Bob towards his limit. If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can push Bob further with a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in negotiations.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling my intent to get a better price. I'll counter with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Middle Ground:** $1,300,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product brings to him, justifying the price.
* **Open to Agreement:** I'm ending with a call to action, hoping to encourage Bob to accept my offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quicker resolution while still ensuring I receive a price closer to my desired amount. By offering a slightly lower price, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. Based on my financial situation, I would like to propose purchasing the product for $1,250,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer, while slightly higher, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price by counter-offering again.
* **John is a safe backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to keep negotiating.

**Strategy:**

I will counter-offer with a price slightly higher than Bob's but lower than my previous offer. By continuing to negotiate, I aim to maximize my profit while remaining aware of my minimum acceptable price and the option of selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's but still lower than my previous offer, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. The language in the message aims to create a sense of finality and encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to counter with a price of $1,260,000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $1,260,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiations:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, potentially leading to a deal below my minimum. 
* **Time factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might drag the process out,  potentially leading to a lost opportunity cost.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a deal that is reasonably close to my minimum and minimizes the risk of getting a lower price or losing the opportunity altogether.  It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the need to secure a deal within a reasonable timeframe."
