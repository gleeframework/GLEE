"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to achieve a more reasonable price for this unique asset. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  To find common ground, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I receive a reasonable price. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
