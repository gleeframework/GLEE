Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to achieve a more reasonable price for this unique asset. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
