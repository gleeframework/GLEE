"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $1,400,000?  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but based on my current financial situation, $1,400,000 is still slightly out of reach. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,375,000? This would allow me to make the purchase while staying within my budget.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
