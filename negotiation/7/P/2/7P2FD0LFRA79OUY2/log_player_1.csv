"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. My starting price is $120, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows Bob to see that I am serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
