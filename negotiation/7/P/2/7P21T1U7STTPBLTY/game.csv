,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about $82?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal.",82.0,Alice,5,
