"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,250,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,250,000 represents its true value, I understand you have budget considerations.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000? This still offers me a significant return while acknowledging your initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your desire to find a price that works for you.  To try and bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and reflects my eagerness to finalize the deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
