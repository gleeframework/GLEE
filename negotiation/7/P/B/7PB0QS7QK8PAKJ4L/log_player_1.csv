""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a unique opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount compared to its true worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation increases the chance of acceptance while still securing a significant profit margin.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder offer to Bob.

By offering the product at $925,000, you aim to:

1. **Maximize your profit** if Bob accepts.
2. **Leave Bob with a substantial perceived gain**, making the offer more appealing.
3. **Maintain a safety net** in case Bob rejects, as you can sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
