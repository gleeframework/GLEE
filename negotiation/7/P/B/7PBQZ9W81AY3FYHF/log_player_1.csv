Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it very valuable."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to aim slightly lower to entice Bob while still maximizing your potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $149 creates a sense of urgency and a slight discount perception for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything because you'll sell it to John at your minimum acceptable price."
