"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's significantly above my maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's better to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that figure?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. My counteroffer is $980,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  While it's closer to my budget, it's still $180,000 over what I'm willing to pay. I can likely get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $980,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering we're already on round 4, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession. My next offer is $920,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests and gets me closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still too high. While she's showing a willingness to negotiate, it's still significantly above my budget. I'm close to my limit, but there's still room to try and negotiate further. I'm hoping we can reach a compromise closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $920,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $850,000, which is a significant step closer to your needs. This is a fair offer considering our previous discussions and the value you place on the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value I place on the product and the fact that we're already at round 7, I'm willing to make a final concession. My next offer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I bring to the table, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my budget, even though she has shown a willingness to negotiate. We're already at round 7, and I'm starting to run out of time.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that we might not reach a deal, and I'll end up having to buy from John anyway.  Given that I have a guaranteed alternative at $800,000, it makes more sense to cut my losses and purchase from John."
