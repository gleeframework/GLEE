"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can leverage John's lower price to try and negotiate a better deal with Alice or proceed to buy from John at a much lower cost."
