Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not budging from there. I'm starting to think that's the best price we can reach.

It seems like Alice is getting a little stuck on her price. It's time to start getting firmer and signal that we're willing to walk away if we can't get a reasonable price.  We've still got a few rounds and John's offer as backup."

Round 8

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're feeling pressure to move forward, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. I believe this is the absolute minimum I can accept for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal today.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and we're running out of rounds.  $925,000 is a decent price and saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer."
