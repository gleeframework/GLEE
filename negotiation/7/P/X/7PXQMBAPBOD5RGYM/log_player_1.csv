Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $100 as a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but not so high that it's likely to be rejected immediately.  It allows for negotiation and gives me some room to bargain down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $75 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $85 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go to $80.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. It's better than selling to John for the same amount, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round."
