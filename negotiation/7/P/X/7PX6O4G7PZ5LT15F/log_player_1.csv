While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,000,000 is a good business decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  I'm still making a healthy profit of $200,000 over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation rounds and potential delays, allowing me to re-invest the earnings sooner.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's always a risk Bob might walk away, especially if I push too hard. Accepting secures the sale."
