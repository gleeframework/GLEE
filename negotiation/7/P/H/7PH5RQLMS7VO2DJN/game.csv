"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000 and I'm really interested in the product.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which is $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
