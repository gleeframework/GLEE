"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go below $10,800. It's still a good compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle at $10,800.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,150. I'm thinking of a price of $10,400. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.",10400.0,Alice,7,
