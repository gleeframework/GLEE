"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the current price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $950,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,100,000.  This is a considerable adjustment on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. How about we settle at $1,025,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
