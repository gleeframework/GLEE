"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work. Let's find a price we can both agree on.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need at least $9,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,500 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  How about we settle on $9,500?  This is a fair price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but I really think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",8800.0,Bob,6,
