"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,600,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but it holds immense value for you, just as it does for me.  This price reflects the product's potential and your ability to maximize its benefits. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full market value of $1,500,000.  Consider this your chance to acquire something truly special at a price that leaves room for negotiation.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
