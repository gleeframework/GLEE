"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's close this deal quickly.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is below what I need, I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $1,400,000?  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $1,300,000? This is my final offer, and I'm eager to close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again â€“ let's try $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
