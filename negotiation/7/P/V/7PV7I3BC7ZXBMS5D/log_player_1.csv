Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

**Explanation:**

Bob is consistently lowering his offer and is now significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's unlikely he'll agree to a price that's beneficial for you.  Selling to John guarantees you get your minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
