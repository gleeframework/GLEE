"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. If you're not interested, I will be selling to John.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
