"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth well over a million to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let's close the deal!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This price reflects the value of the product and provides a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're committed to finding a solution.  I'm willing to move a little closer to your price, but $1,075,000 just doesn't quite cut it. How about we settle on $1,100,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe we can both be happy with this agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
