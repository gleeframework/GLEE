,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  $1200000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1300000? That would leave room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit above my budget. How about $1200000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not sure if $1250000 is the best deal for me. How about $1150000? I'm trying to stay within my budget and get the best value for my money.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1150000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession.  Let's split the difference and go with $1200000.  I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to go up to $1180000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",1180000.0,Bob,8,
