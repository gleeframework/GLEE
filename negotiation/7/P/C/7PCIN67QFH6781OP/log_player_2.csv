You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still too high for him. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still higher than his ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. Buying from John for $800,000 would be a better deal, but it seems like Alice is willing to come down to a price that's closer to Bob's budget. It's likely that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, but Bob risks losing the deal altogether if he continues to reject offers."
