"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000? This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value our negotiation, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution.  Let's try $1,450,000.  This price is a good compromise, and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
