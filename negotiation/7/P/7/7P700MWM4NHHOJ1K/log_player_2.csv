"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $120, which is more than your maximum budget of $100.  It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within my budget.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $105 is closer to my budget, it's still $5 more than I'm willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my limit.  It's a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will accept this offer."
