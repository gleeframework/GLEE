"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum value. This is a strong opening offer that allows for negotiation while still keeping the potential for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is only $1 more than my minimum, I'm not going to accept it just yet. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my initial offer. I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm reducing my price by $100,000. This shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum value. I believe this is a fair compromise that encourages Bob to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better deal. There are still 6 rounds left, and I am not yet desperate enough to sell to John. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only by $50,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding onto a significant profit margin. I'm confident that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $20,000 less than what John would pay, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure this deal now rather than risk losing both Bob and John."
