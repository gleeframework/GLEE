"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $950000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $930000. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a fair price, but I need to make a living on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, but that's as low as I can go.

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $915000. I'm starting to think that selling to John might be a better option for me. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a deal. I'll meet you at $913000, but that's as low as I can go.
