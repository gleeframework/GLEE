"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you set a high anchor. This might make your later concessions seem more substantial. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high price provides ample room for negotiation over the next 10 rounds.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer helps you gauge Bob's eagerness and flexibility. His response will reveal how aggressively he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I've done some research and I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. This suggests he's trying to anchor the negotiation very low.  Rejecting this offer is crucial to signal that you're serious about the product's value and won't settle for a lowball deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but your offer is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 to find common ground, but $900,000 is simply not feasible."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Controlled Concession:** Dropping $150,000 demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but not desperation.
* **Holding Firm:** By stating $900,000 is ""not feasible,"" you reaffirm your position and avoid getting anchored too low. 
* **Justification:** You reiterate the product's value, subtly countering Bob's research claim. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:** This offer invites Bob to move closer to your range. His next response will be telling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,225,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is above your absolute minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Strong Position:** While you could potentially push for more, you're already in a good negotiating position. Bob has significantly increased his offer from $900,000, indicating strong interest.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the possibility of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting a good offer now is often better than holding out for a potentially slightly better offer later."
