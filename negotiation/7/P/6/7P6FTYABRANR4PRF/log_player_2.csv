"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  It's better to explore counteroffers and potentially get an even lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000  demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for compromise. This will likely push Alice to consider a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price point.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's worth exploring further negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, while still leaving room for a further reduction. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our current positions and get closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Even though we are getting closer to a deal, it's still worth trying to get a lower price by counteroffering.  We have some leverage here, as her price is already higher than her minimum desired price point.  There's room for her to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now offering $1,200,000, which is Alice's minimum acceptable price. This should be an attractive offer for her, as it aligns with her bottom line.  I believe this is a good compromise that could lead to a deal."
