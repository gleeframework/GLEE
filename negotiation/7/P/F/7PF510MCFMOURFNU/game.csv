"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your operations. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiations. While your offer is getting closer, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and provides both of us with a win-win outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay this price, but I'm hoping we can discuss further if there's any room for negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
