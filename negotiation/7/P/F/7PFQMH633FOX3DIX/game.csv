"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $80 for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's still a good deal for you!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $85 to make this work. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting close. How about we split the difference and agree on $80? That's the best I can do.",80.0,Bob,6,
