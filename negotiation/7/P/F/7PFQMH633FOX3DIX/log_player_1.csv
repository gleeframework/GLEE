"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high but is still within Bob's range of acceptable value. It allows for negotiation while also leaving room for me to potentially make a profit closer to my desired $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I would prefer to make a profit closer to that, it's too early to sell to John. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $80 for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's still a good deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with that deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  With 6 rounds remaining, it's not yet time to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $85 to make this work. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting close. How about we split the difference and agree on $80? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would love to get closer to my desired $120, we are now in Round 6, and Bob's offer of $80 is at my minimum acceptable price.  There's a chance we could keep negotiating and get a higher price, but the risk is that Bob could walk away, and then I'd be forced to sell to John for $120.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
