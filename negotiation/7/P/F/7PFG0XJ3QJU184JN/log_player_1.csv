{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175** is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer, highlighting the value of the product.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I aim to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Open a negotiation:** This leaves room for counteroffers and gives Bob the opportunity to feel involved in the process. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can always lower my price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me.
*  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$140** is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **The message** is friendly and maintains a positive tone, while still firmly stating my position.

This approach aims to:

* **Get closer to my target price:** By moving closer to $150, I increase the chance of a successful negotiation.
* **Show flexibility:**  While not accepting Bob's initial offer, I am demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects, I can still choose to move on to John or adjust my counteroffer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* While it's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, accepting it would still result in a loss for me.
* I'm choosing to reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're still not quite there, but $130 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$135:** This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining some negotiating room.
* **The message:** The tone is still positive and encouraging, but it also conveys firmness. I acknowledge Bob's position while reaffirming my own.
* **Moving towards a deal:** This counteroffer aims to reach an agreement while still prioritizing my financial goals.

This approach aims to:

* **Minimize potential loss:** By getting closer to Bob's offer, I reduce the risk of walking away with a significantly lower price.
* **Encourage a deal:** The message aims to motivate Bob to accept this final compromise.
* **Preserve option:** If Bob still rejects, I can still choose to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely result in further concessions and a price that is ultimately unacceptable. 

Selling to John for $150 ensures I meet my minimum acceptable price and avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation. While I would prefer to get closer to $175, securing a sale at $150 is a safe and reasonable choice in this situation."
