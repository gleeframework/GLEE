"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this deal work. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not quite there, but $130 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's try to make this work!",135.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",125.0,Bob,6,
