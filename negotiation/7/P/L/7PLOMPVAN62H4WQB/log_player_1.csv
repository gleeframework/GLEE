"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" the message aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value above his estimated $800,000.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The question ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to participate in the negotiation, making him feel involved in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate further and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John now would be a guaranteed profit, but there's a potential to earn more from Bob if you play your cards right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Its unique capabilities and market potential justify a much higher price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reject:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer but firmly reiterates that it's too low.
* **Highlight Value (Again):** Emphasizing ""unique capabilities"" and ""market potential"" reinforces the product's value proposition. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  Offering to meet ""halfway"" at $1,500,000 appears like a significant concession while still keeping the price well above your minimum. This signals flexibility but also sets a firm boundary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to push for more, there's a risk he might walk away, and you'd be left with the same offer from John. Accepting now secures your desired profit."
