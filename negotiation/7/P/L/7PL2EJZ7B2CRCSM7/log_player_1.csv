Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the $700,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product and its potential for you. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a reasonable price.  While $750,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can still get a better deal from him with a bit more negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to hold out for a bit more.  He's incrementally increasing his offers, which shows he's still interested.  I'm aiming to get him closer to $790,000 or higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're really close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's wrap this up â€“ I'm willing to come down slightly to $795,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 795000
}

**Reasoning:** This offer creates a sense of urgency by presenting it as my ""final offer."" I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price than his last offer but giving him a small concession to encourage him to close the deal."
