"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the $700,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product and its potential for you. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we try $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
