"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm starting with an offer of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $8,200? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's worth it for this product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,200, which would be $8,100. Can you accept this offer?",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $8,100. I'm going to take a firmer stance and propose a price that's closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $8,400? I think it's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to stand firm on this offer.",8400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stand firm on your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,400, which would be $8,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Can you reconsider?",8200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge from my minimum price of $8,400. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we meet at $8,300? It's a compromise, but I think it's worth considering.",8300.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,300. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to pay more than $8,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,10,
