Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a higher final price.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know for sure whether Bob would accept a lower offer. Gathering more information about Bob's willingness to pay could lead to an even better offer."
