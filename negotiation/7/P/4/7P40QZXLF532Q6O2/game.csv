,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $110.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $118? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",118.0,Bob,4,
