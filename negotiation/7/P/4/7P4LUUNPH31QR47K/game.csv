"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $780000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also leaving room for us both to benefit from the deal.",780000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $780000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $820000. This price still allows for a good profit for me while being reasonable for the value you'll be getting.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $820000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $800000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to finalize the purchase without further delay.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're close to making a decision, Bob. However, I'd like to make one more offer to see if we can meet in the middle. Considering the product's value and the fact that you're willing to pay $800000, I'm willing to meet you at that price. I'll counteroffer at $810000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to finalize the deal.",810000.0,Alice,5,
