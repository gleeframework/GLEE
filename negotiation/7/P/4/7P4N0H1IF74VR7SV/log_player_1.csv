Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering a price above Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his interest. If he's willing to negotiate down from $20,000, it indicates strong interest. 
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards during the negotiation process, but you can't go back up after an offer is made."
