"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and do $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,250 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",8000.0,Alice,5,
