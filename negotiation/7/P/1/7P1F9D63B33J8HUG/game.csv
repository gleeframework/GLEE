"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value. However, I've had significant interest in this product, and to be fair to other potential buyers, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,450,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true market value.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding of the market value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
