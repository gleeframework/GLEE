{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's also lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good chance of getting a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice. I understand it's a good product. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $97 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $97 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split the difference and go with $101.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 101}
