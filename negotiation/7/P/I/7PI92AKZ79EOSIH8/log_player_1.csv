Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he counters, it's likely his counter-offer will be higher than if you started lower.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, he might not be willing to pay significantly more than that.  
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. Consider how low you're willing to go before you walk away and sell to John."
