"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's desired limit of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to save as much as possible, so starting low is a good strategy. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, considering Alice's initial offer and Bob's desired price. 
* **Negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows for negotiation and gives Alice a chance to reconsider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a good value for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:**  $10,500 is still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has 7 rounds left to try and get a better price.
* **Potential for Lower Price:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to his desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stepping Closer:**  Bob is now offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $9,500 is a good middle ground, potentially appealing to Alice.
* **Negotiation:** This offer keeps the negotiation moving and puts pressure on Alice to respond."
