"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, I'm looking to purchase it closer to $700,000. Would that price point be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to purchase the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer on the price.  I'm happy to negotiate further and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress, but I still think $750,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $825,000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't meet that price point.  I'm willing to pay $775,000 to close this deal today. Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $800,000? This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've done a good job negotiating!  I'm willing to move a bit closer to meet your price. How about $785,000 and we close this deal today?",785000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob, but I still think we can get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one last push. How about we meet at $810,000? This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",810000.0,Alice,9,
