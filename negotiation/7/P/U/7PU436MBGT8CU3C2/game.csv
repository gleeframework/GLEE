"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit above $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I think I can do better than that. Let's try $1020000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
