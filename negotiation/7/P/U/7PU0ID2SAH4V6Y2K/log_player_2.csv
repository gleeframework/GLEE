"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of starting at $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing your serious intent to negotiate.  It's still above Alice's desired price point, leaving room for further bargaining.  This should make it more likely Alice will accept or at least counter with a more reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer of $1,250,000 is still too high. You have time to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to your desired range.  Continuing to counter will hopefully push Alice closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is another significant move towards Alice's position, demonstrating your willingness to compromise. It's still below Alice's offer, but higher than your previous offer, showing flexibility while keeping the pressure on to secure a better price. This approach aims to find a middle ground and make the next round a likely acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still think the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to compromise at $1,180,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price range, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high. You have several rounds left, and it's worth pushing for a lower price.  You've demonstrated a willingness to compromise, and continuing to negotiate will likely lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This is getting very close to my limit, but I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a subtle increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your commitment to finding a middle ground while staying below Alice's offer. It's a calculated risk, as Alice might reject it, but the strategy is to keep pushing while showing a genuine interest in closing the deal.  It's more likely Alice will accept this offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at the door. However, I still think the product's value is slightly higher. I'm willing to compromise at $1,160,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,160,000 is getting very close to your desired price range, and she's stated this is her final offer. It's likely she won't budge further. You have a few rounds left, but the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again is high. It's a good idea to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price. You've successfully negotiated a lower price, saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
