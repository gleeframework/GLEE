Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offer is higher than what Bob values the product at. This might seem counterintuitive, but it gives you a starting point to potentially negotiate down to a price that's still above your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John willing to pay your minimum price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
