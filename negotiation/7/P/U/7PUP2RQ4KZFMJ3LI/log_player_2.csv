Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $128? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $128 is within my budget, and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer of $126. At this point, I'm not sure I can push her lower, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's a good price for me, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product."
