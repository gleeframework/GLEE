Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum.** This gives him room to negotiate and keeps you within your desired profit margin.
* **It's a strong opening offer.** This sets the tone for the negotiation and gives you leverage.
* **It includes a friendly message.** This helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price.  I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, so how about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to make a deal with Bob, his final offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to take such a significant loss on the product. I'll sell to John for $150, ensuring I at least meet my minimum profit margin."
