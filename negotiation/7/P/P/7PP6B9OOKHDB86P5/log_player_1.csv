Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum of $150 but below what I know the product is worth to me. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at the absolute maximum to allow for some negotiation and a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob by making a counteroffer or even selling to John if necessary. 
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss compared to my minimum value and potentially to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $150? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** I'm offering my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This ensures I don't lose money.
* **Compromise:** I've made a concession from my initial offer, showing flexibility to Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John offers a better price:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he may reject my next counteroffer, potentially leading to a loss of time and the opportunity to sell to John."
