Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $80 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this amazing product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. This product is worth more to me than that, and I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at $110 and is unlikely to go lower.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her not budging and you losing out on John's guaranteed $100 offer."
