Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation, as it's less than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).  

I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects, but I'll also be keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my target of $1,400,000. I'll try to meet him in the middle with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to come down that much. How about we meet at $1,350,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $1,300,000 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my target price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale that is significantly higher than John's offer. There is little chance of me getting a higher price by continuing negotiations, especially considering Bob's willingness to meet me in the middle."
