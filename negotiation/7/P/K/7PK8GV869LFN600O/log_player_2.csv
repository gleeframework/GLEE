"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very competitive price. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.  Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's offer of $100. However, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer.  You know the product is only worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
