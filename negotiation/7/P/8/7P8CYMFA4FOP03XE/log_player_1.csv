{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point for the negotiation. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for bargaining.  It also shows you're willing to negotiate and find a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but $140 is a bit outside my budget. How about $125? I'm really interested in the product and think we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $132.50? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a bit more, but I'm still only comfortable going up to $130.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum price of $150 and still above my personal value of the product.  It's a good compromise and ensures a sale without risking losing the deal with John."
