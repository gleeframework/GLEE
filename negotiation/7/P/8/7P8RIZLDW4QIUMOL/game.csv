"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. Would you be willing to accept that price?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,400, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and make this happen!",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to go up to $8,300, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",8300.0,Bob,6,
