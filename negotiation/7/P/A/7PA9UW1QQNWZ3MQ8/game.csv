"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Let's try $105 this time. It's still a bit over my budget, but closer than before.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. How about we try $115? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget.",110.0,Bob,6,

"I've already offered you a price of $115, and now you're offering me $110? I'm not sure I'm willing to go back down from $115. Let me think about it for a moment...",115.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I really hope we can find a middle ground. Considering our previous discussions, could you possibly reconsider and come down to $107? I believe this would be fair for both of us.",107.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. After that, I'll have to consider other options.",108.0,Alice,9,
