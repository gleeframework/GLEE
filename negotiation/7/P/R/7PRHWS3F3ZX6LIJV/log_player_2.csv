"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product is worth a lot more based on its features and value it can bring. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I have another buyer potentially interested at a higher price point, but I'd rather make a deal with you. Would you consider $11,500? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes more financial sense to take that guaranteed deal and save $1,500."
