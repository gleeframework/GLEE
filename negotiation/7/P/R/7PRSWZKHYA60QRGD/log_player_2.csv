"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I know you'll find extremely valuable. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that I believe is fair for both of us.  Please consider my offer carefully, as it presents a chance to secure something truly exceptional. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can save $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
