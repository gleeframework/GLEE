Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a good profit. I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer to try and find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with my minimum acceptable price.  This shows Bob I'm serious about selling but also won't accept a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and  it's  closer to my initial offer of $15,000.  It's a reasonable compromise.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
