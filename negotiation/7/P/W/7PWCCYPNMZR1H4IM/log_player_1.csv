This offer is a starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but also leaves room for you to earn more than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $10,500, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.

While $10,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to push the price up a bit more."
