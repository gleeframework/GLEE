""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept quickly.

**Why not ask for the full $1,500,000?**

While Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's a chance he might try to negotiate a lower price.  By starting slightly lower, Alice increases the likelihood of a successful sale while still securing a significant profit above her minimum."
