"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product has the potential to generate substantial value, and I'm confident it's worth much more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still quite far apart.  I can go up to $1,400,000, but that's my limit.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I can see we're getting closer. How about we settle on $1,650,000? That reflects a significant movement from my initial ask while still acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,475,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,575,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1575000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting down to the wire. I can offer $1,500,000, but I can't go any higher. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
