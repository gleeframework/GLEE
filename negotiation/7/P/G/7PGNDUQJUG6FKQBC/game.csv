"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiations. However, I need to let you know that I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my minimum price of $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately higher than my budget allows.  I understand the product is worth $15000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. I'm prepared to offer $12000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13500. However, I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $14500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, which is a fair compromise. It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. Let's try $15000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
