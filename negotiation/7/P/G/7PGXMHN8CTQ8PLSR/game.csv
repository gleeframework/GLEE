"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $120 to you. Considering this, I'd like to propose an offer of $150 for the product. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the opportunity to secure such a high-quality item at a slightly elevated cost. I look forward to your response.",150.0,Alice,1,
