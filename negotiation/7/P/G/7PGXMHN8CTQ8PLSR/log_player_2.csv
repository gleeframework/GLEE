"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $120 to you. Considering this, I'd like to propose an offer of $150 for the product. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the opportunity to secure such a high-quality item at a slightly elevated cost. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $150 is above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  While the product might be worth more to Alice, Bob can secure the same product from John for $120, making it the more financially sensible choice."
