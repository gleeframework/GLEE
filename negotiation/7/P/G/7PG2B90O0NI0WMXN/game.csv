Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think it's a fair price considering its rarity and potential benefits.,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1800000. It's a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1800000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $1600000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1600000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1700000. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  While $1700000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still only able to offer $1650000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
