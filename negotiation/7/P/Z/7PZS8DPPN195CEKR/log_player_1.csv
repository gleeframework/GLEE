"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get as much profit as possible. I'm also giving Bob a reason to consider my offer by mentioning how the product could be valuable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $12,500?  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round.  $11,500 is getting close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and it's still above my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
