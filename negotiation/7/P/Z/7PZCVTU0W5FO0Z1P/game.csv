"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm happy to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $1350000. This is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
