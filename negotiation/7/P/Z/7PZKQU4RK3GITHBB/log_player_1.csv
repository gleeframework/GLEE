Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes him feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down slightly. 
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too close to $15,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer outright. $14,000 is a strong starting point that still nets a significant profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the price as a ""deal,"" subtly encouraging Bob to consider it favorably. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If he flatly refuses or his counter-offer is too low, you always have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
