"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price is fair considering my budget and its value to me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you and the market value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
