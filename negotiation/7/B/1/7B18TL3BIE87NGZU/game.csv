"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. How about we compromise at $8200? It's a great price for a product like this, and I think it's a fair offer.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8200. How about we try $7500? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but still within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $8100? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I still need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $7800? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,6,
