"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.** There's no immediate advantage to accepting it. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** You might be able to get a lower price from Alice.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You'll get the product, but at your maximum price.  

By rejecting, you open the possibility of saving money without risking losing the product altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** A significant counteroffer (20% lower) shows you're serious about negotiating but also gives Alice room to come up.
* **Being polite but firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while stating your price point. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows for a back-and-forth without immediately hitting your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice met you halfway:**  Her offer is a reasonable compromise from your previous counteroffer.
* **You're saving money:**  $11,500 is still less than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  You could try to negotiate further, but there's a chance she'll refuse and you'll end up paying the full $12,000 to John.

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that is a good deal for you."
