Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you'll find immense value in it. I'm asking for $15,000. I'm confident it's worth significantly more than that, but I want to give you the opportunity to benefit from it."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($15,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price well above your minimum ($10,000).
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will purchase the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob declines, you haven't lost anything.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob encourages him to consider the offer seriously, even if it seems initially high."
