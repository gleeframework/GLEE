Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still quite a bit below what I need for this product.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
