"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $5,000 is a bit too far below what I need to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That would be a good deal for me and still a decent price for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still quite a bit below what I need for this product.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
