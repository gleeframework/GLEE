Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that I'm sure will be a great investment for you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're setting a price that's above your minimum of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so you're giving him a potential deal.
* **It signals your intent to negotiate:** By offering a price, you're opening the door to a back-and-forth discussion.

This approach allows you to:

* **Maximize your potential earnings:** You're starting high, but not so high that it scares Bob off.
* **Assess Bob's level of interest:** His response will tell you how serious he is about buying.
* **Maintain control:** You can always fall back to selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable price. While you could accept it and avoid further negotiation, there's potential to earn more. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Show you're not desperate:** This demonstrates you're not willing to settle for the bare minimum.
* **Maintain leverage:** You can potentially get closer to your desired price.
* **Explore if Bob is truly serious:**  His counteroffer will reveal how committed he is to the deal. 

**Next Step:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and agree on $850,000?  This would still give you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  By offering $850,000, you're demonstrating flexibility while still getting closer to your desired price. 
* **Highlight Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value to him reinforces that this is a good deal for him, despite being higher than his initial offer.
* **Collaborative Tone:** The message focuses on reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, making the negotiation seem less adversarial. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's sincerity:**  If he's serious about buying, he'll likely be receptive to this compromise.
* **Move the needle closer to your goal:**  You're aiming to earn more than $800,000 while still staying within a range that's likely acceptable to Bob.
* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:** You're not letting it stall by accepting the minimum offer, but you're also not being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's important to consider the following:

* **Potential for further negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate may lead to a stalemate or further delay, and it's uncertain if we can reach a higher price.
* **Time factor:**  Spending more time negotiating could cost me valuable time and potentially result in John buying the product. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might withdraw entirely.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's very close to my minimum.  It's a good compromise that minimizes risk and allows me to move forward quickly."
