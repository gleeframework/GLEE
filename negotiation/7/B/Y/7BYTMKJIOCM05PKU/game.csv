"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. This is my final offer.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can offer you a compromise at $155. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring you.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $135. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $135, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you in the middle at $142.50. It's a fair price that works for both of us.",142.5,Alice,5,
