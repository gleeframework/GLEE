"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my own minimum. This leaves room for negotiation, while still giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, but it's a starting point for negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great price for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $13,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is within a reasonable range and there are only 6 rounds left.  It's a good deal considering my minimum is $15,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
