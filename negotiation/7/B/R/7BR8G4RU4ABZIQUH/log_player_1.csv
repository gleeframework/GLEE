{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high to gauge your interest and leave room for negotiation. It's important to appear confident about the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise that still secures a significant profit. This approach shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly interested but also price-conscious.  $8,750 is a solid profit above my minimum, and continuing to push could risk losing the sale altogether.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
