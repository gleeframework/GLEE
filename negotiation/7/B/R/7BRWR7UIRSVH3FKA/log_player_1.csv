Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" aims to justify the high price, even if the exact value proposition is not explicitly stated in this scenario. 
* **Gauging interest:** This initial offer serves as a way to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you can significantly lower the price or move on to John without wasting time."
