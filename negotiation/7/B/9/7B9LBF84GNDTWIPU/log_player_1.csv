{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I've also made it clear I'm open to negotiation, which may encourage Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping for something closer to $90 to reflect the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise, and it's higher than John's offer. I'm happy to accept this and finalize the deal."
