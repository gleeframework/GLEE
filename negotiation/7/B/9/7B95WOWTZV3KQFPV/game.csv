"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $15,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford right now. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your honest offer. I understand that $8,000 is the maximum you can afford, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $13,500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. How about we try $14,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.",14000.0,Alice,7,
