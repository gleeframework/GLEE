# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your honest offer. I understand that $8,000 is the maximum you can afford, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my $8,000 limit. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I can still get a better price from her or buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $13,500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. How about we try $14,000?
