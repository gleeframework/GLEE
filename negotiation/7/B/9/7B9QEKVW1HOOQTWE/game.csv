"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000?  That seems like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,4,
