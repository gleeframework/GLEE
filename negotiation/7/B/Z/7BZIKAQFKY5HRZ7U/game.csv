"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the $18,000 offer. Given my budget, I am unable to go beyond $15,000. I hope this aligns with your considerations.",15000.0,Bob,4,
