"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. I believe it's a valuable asset and this price reflects its potential. Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's a good investment for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. However, $1200000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $1400000? It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $1300000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1300000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $1350000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale and ensure a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's compromise at $1300000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'd like to throw in a condition. If you're willing to sell the product for $1300000, I'd like to negotiate a longer warranty or some additional support for the product. This would make the deal more attractive to me and justify the price.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
