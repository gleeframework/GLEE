Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high.  I'm only interested in paying a price that reflects the product's value to me, which is around $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but this is my starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While the product holds significant value for you at $1,200,000, its potential impact and unique aspects justify a higher price point.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This price is fair for both of us considering the value the product holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his valuation, but we are still far apart.  It's time to signal I have other options while still trying to negotiate a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your position, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I've received interest from other potential buyers, however, I value our interaction and believe we can still reach an agreement.  To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Deadline Pressure:** By mentioning other buyers and presenting this as a final offer, we're introducing a sense of urgency.
* **Compromise, but with a Limit:** We're showing a willingness to compromise by dropping the price significantly, but we're also setting a clear boundary to avoid getting lowballed.
* **Aiming Above John's Offer:**  Our goal remains to get the best possible price, which is ideally above John's standing offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,400,000?  This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above John's standing offer of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Negotiation Position:** We successfully moved Bob up from his initial offer of $1,200,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation and secures a profitable sale."
