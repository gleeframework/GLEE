{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be very valuable for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation and also signals that I am serious about making a deal with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I think we can find a better price. I'm willing to pay $1020000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price. Although it's still lower than what I ideally want, accepting this offer will result in a faster sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
