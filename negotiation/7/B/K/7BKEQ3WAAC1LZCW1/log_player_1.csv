Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price, without explicitly stating a false value.
* **Openness:** By inviting Bob's thoughts and mentioning you're ""open to hearing"" him, you encourage negotiation and make him feel like he has some control in the process. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, and any amount above $10,000 is a win."
