"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a great price! I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is at Bob's maximum price, there's no incentive to accept it immediately. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still within Bob's budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and he risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer secures the product for a reasonable price."
