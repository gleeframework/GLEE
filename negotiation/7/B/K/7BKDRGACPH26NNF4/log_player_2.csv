"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within Bob's budget. It demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but is willing to negotiate. This gives Alice a reason to counter, hopefully moving the price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's target, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining.  A counteroffer could potentially bring the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,000 is a good step, but it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate and show his commitment to buying the product, but he's still pushing for a lower price.  By offering $11,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to save money. This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court and hopefully moves the price closer to his goal."
