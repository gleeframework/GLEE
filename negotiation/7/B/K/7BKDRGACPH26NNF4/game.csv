"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair price considering the value it brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,000 is a good step, but it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
