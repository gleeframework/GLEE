"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price still provides you with a good value, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while $700,000 is getting closer, I'm still not able to let go of this product for that price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a substantial value for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
