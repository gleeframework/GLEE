# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great price, considering the product is worth $12,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, getting you a better deal."
