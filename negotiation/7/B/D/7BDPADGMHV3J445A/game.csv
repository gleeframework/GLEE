"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering you the product for $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you've expressed and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've expressed and the value you've expressed as well.",10250.0,Bob,4,
