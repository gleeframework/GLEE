"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

It's not worth paying $150 for a product you value at $120.  You can do better by counteroffering or buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $110, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my value, it's still more than I want to pay. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a good compromise and closer to her value. Let's see if she'll accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice keeps increasing her price. I've already made two counteroffers and she's not budging.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $120.  It's the best option at this point."
