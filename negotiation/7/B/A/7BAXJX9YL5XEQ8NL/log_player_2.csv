"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $14,000, which is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  You can still buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also within the range of your budget, making it a reasonable starting point. By offering $10,500, you're showing a willingness to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to your target of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to get a better deal.  If things don't work out, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  It's also still below Alice's offer, leaving room for further negotiation.  At this price, I'm taking a bit more of a risk, but I believe the product is worth it. If Alice rejects this offer, I can still buy from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I'm concerned that I might not be able to get the price down further. Since John is willing to sell the product to me for $10,000, it's more financially prudent to buy from John and avoid any further risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer."
