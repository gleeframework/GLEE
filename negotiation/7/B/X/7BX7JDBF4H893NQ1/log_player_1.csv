"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations.  To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This sets a high anchor, potentially influencing Bob to consider a higher counteroffer than he might have initially thought.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price provides ample room for negotiation and concessions throughout the 10 rounds.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer helps me gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and his potential budget. His response will give me valuable information for the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is better than my guaranteed offer from John ($1,500,000). However, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming up from your initial proposal.  While $1,400,000 is a respectable offer, the product's value to me is considerably higher. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer ($150,000 reduction) to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle.
* **Still Above Both Minimums:** My counteroffer remains above both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's stated value ($1,200,000).
* **Guaging Bob's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Bob is willing to be and whether a mutually beneficial agreement is attainable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $1,700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress! Bob increased his offer by $300,000, showing serious interest. However, $1,700,000 is still less than I want to accept at this point. I'll counter, aiming to close the gap but prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer again.  I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,775,000?"",
""product_price"": 1775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous price ($1,850,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,700,000). 
* **Signaling Flexibility:** By suggesting a meeting point, I'm demonstrating continued willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price point still keeps me comfortably above my guaranteed option with John ($1,500,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've decided to increase my offer to $1,725,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum, Showing Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,725,000 is a substantial amount above my guaranteed sale price with John. While I could likely push for more, Bob has consistently increased his offer, showing a strong desire for the product. This suggests it holds significant value for him, making this a good deal even if it's not the absolute highest I could potentially achieve.

* **Time Value and Risk:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing carries the risk that Bob walks away or the deal falls apart. Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids potentially leaving money on the table by pushing too hard."
