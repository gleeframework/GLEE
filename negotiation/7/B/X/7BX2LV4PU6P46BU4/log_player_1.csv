Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth and represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below her own $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit.
* **Strong but Fair Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and positions the price as a fair deal, increasing the chances of acceptance.

**Why not other approaches:**

* **Asking for $1,200,000 or more:**  This would likely result in Bob immediately rejecting the offer, as it's above his perceived value. 
* **Going too low (close to $1,000,000):**  This leaves potential profit on the table, especially since Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John."
