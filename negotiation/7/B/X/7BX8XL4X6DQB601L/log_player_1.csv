"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Above Bob's value:** This price is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Open ended:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his opinion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **I can still do better:** I have more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can still sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer above minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum price of $100, but it shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying above Bob's value:**  $105 is still above Bob's perceived value of $80, giving me some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing a desire to find a compromise. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm using language like ""middle ground"" to signal that I'm open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for better offer:** With more rounds remaining, there's still a chance Bob might raise his offer. 
* **Safe option to sell to John:**  If I don't get a better offer, I can still sell to John for $100, so there's no immediate risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $95 is still just a little below what I need. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** This counteroffer is exactly at my minimum acceptable price, but it's still above Bob's perceived value of $80.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing it as a ""fair"" price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Clear and direct:** The message is concise and avoids any ambiguity. 
* **Last chance offer:** By stating it's a ""fair price for both of us"", it implies this could be my final offer before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While he's come up a bit, his offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We're halfway through the negotiations, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob.
* **Selling to John is the safest option:** By selling to John for $100, I guarantee myself my minimum price and avoid further risk of getting a lower offer from Bob."
