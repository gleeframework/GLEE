**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price. 
* **You still save money:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($1,000,000), it's still within your budget of $1,500,000 and saves you money compared to John's offer."
