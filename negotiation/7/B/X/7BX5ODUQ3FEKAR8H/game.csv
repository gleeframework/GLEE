"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective, the product's value remains closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,825,000. This is the lowest I can go and still feel comfortable with the deal. If this doesn't work, I may need to explore other options.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $1,700,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
