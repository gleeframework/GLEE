"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value for the product is $100. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he's not, I can always move on to John and secure a guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $125. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price for me. It also gives Bob a chance to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher in the next round. If not, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $115. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible while still trying to get a fair price.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can close the deal. If Bob rejects again, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. While I would have liked to get more, it's better to secure a deal for $105 than risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for $100.  I've also had several rounds of negotiation, so it's time to finalize the deal."
