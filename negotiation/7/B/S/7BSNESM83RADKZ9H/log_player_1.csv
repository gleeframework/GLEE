Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down if he wants, while still earning you a significant profit.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to your minimum ($80) could lead to a quick rejection from Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
