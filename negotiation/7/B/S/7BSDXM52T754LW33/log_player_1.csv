Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts â€“ this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Time Limit:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without prolonged negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potentially even more profitable outcome for you. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, setting an excessively high price might lead Bob to walk away without counter-offering."
