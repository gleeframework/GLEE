Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Creating Urgency:** By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity"" we might incentivize Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn an extra $150,000."
