"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,200 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I'd like to propose an alternative. I can offer you a small concession by including a premium service package with the product, which typically costs $200. This way, the total value you'll receive is still higher than my initial offer, and you'll get additional benefits. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,300, including the premium service package.",8300.0,Alice,5,
