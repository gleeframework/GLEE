{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. It's likely Bob will accept, as he gets a good deal, and I still make a decent profit.  If he rejects, I can comfortably sell to John for my minimum price."
