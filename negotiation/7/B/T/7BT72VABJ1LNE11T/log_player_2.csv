"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my original target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find reasonable. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her original offer, $10,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice has already rejected his counteroffer and is unwilling to go lower than $11,000.  It's clear that they are unlikely to reach an agreement, and John offers a better price."
