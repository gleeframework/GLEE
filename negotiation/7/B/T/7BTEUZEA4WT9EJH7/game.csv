"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $2,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While your valuation is understandable, the value of this product is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000. This is a considerable reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest.  I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I propose $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
