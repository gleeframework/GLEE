We're getting closer, but we're still leaving money on the table. Bob is clearly willing to go higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is as high as I can go.  If you're unable to do that, I understand, but I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price. While you might be able to push for a slightly higher amount, it's risky.  Accepting the $1,000,000 offer guarantees you a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
