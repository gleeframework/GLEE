I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it reflects the value I place on the product.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. It shows flexibility while ensuring a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay a price anywhere near my minimum value.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with him and risk a further drop in price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.  This guarantees me a profit and avoids any further risk."
