"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very reasonable price.  How does $90 sound? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer.  While it's a better deal than buying from John, you can still do better. By rejecting, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or try to find another seller."
