"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,800 is close, but I need to get at least $10,000 for it. That's my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $9,500 again? I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done.",9500.0,Bob,6,
