"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay up to $12000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is a little too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  I truly believe it will be a great asset for you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $12500, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. Let me know if you're open to that.",12500.0,Bob,4,
