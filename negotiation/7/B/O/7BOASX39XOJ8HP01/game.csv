"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,600 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $8,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
