{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $120 is above my maximum budget of $150.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation as Alice's offer is above her minimum value of $100. 
* **Exploring options:**  Rejecting allows me to see if I can get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $125 is above my budget of $150. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice's offer suggests she won't go lower than $125.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** It's likely that further rounds will only lead to a few more dollars in price reduction.
* **Secure purchase:**  Buying from John at $150 guarantees I'll get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that might not result in a satisfactory price."
