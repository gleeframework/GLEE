{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but gives him room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my own desire to close the deal quickly.  It's important to remember John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is significantly below my minimum.  I'll counter with a higher offer, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 
I'm offering a price that's still slightly above Bob's initial offer, but it's a significant compromise. This shows good faith, but I'm still staying above my minimum. If he rejects this, I might have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll make a final counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to considering John's offer if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm really not comfortable going any lower than $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other offers."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering my final price, and it's still slightly above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John and secure my minimum profit."
