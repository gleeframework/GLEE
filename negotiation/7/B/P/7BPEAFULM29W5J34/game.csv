"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $92? It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $92 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $88?  That's a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",90.0,Alice,5,
