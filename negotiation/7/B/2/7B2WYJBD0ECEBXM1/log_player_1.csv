Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but below my minimum desired value of $1,200,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing me to potentially secure a profitable sale.  I'm also setting the stage for further negotiation by explicitly mentioning that this is a ""great deal for both of us."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my desired range. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and may not guarantee a better outcome.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good sale and move on to other opportunities."
