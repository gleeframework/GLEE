Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $13,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A large gap between my desired price ($15,000) and the offer allows for some bargaining without needing to immediately drop to John's offer.
* **Positive message:** A friendly and encouraging message can help keep the negotiation positive and open to potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. It's also below the $13,000 I initially offered, so he hasn't shown much willingness to compromise.
* **Potential for counter-offer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer that might get us closer to a mutually acceptable price. There's still a chance to get a better deal than $9,500.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If I can't get a reasonable price from Bob, I can always sell to John.  I have a fallback position, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $13,000 to $11,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair price:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to his perceived value, making it a more reasonable compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and open to further discussion,  keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $10500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $10,500 is only $4,500 below my minimum desired price of $15,000. It's a much better deal than selling to John for $15,000.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise and has moved closer to my position.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower offer from Bob or could drag out the process. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
