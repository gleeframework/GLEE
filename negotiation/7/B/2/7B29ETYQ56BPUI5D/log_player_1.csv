Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.

Round 4

$10,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't go below $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, $12,500 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't go below $15,000.  I'm confident I can secure this price with Bob or with John, so I'll make another counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still not enough for me to consider. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell for $13,750.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've made a few concessions, but Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum.  There are only two rounds left, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to meet my price. I'm better off selling to John for $15,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
