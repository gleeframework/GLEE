Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might consider. Here's why:

* **My goal is to maximize profit.**  Offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value might entice him to negotiate. 
* **I have a fallback option.** If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for my minimum. 
* **Negotiation is a back-and-forth.** By starting a bit higher, I leave room for a middle ground.

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation, and I'm ready to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for such a drastic loss. I will counteroffer to try and find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 

* **Finding a compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, but it also maintains my financial goals. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is willing to budge from his initial offer. If he's truly only willing to pay $1,200,000, I can move on to my backup option with John.
* **Leaving room for more negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, it gives me the option to lower the price further in future rounds.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he has increased his offer, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for me. I'm confident that I can get my full asking price from John, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob."
