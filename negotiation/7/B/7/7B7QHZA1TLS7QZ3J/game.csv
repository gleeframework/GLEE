"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $7,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
