"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity with a lot of potential value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. This is a common strategy in sales to gauge the buyer's interest and set a starting point.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's unique value and potential, aiming to pique Bob's interest and justify the price.
* **Open Communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to express his thoughts, showing a willingness to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and reactions throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the unique opportunity you're offering with the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1000000. I believe this reflects a fair valuation based on market standards and the potential benefits. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Necessary:** While Bob's offer is too low, he acknowledges the product's value. This indicates there's room for negotiation, and I can potentially secure a better price.
* **Seeking a Compromise:** I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price higher than $1,000,000, but lower than my initial offer of $2,000,000.  I will aim for a price around $1,750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for this product. It's unique, and I'm confident its value will be realized in the market. To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, giving you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Constraints:** I acknowledge his budget limitations to demonstrate empathy and build a foundation for compromise. 
* **Emphasize Value Again:** I re-emphasize the product's uniqueness and potential to justify my counteroffer.
* **Offer a Compromise:** The counteroffer of $1,750,000 is a significant drop from my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable value.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:** I frame the counteroffer as a solution that benefits both of us, encouraging Bob to see the value in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the current market conditions and the potential return on investment, I would like to propose a price of $1250000. This price seems to strike a balance between our interests and could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a significant financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:** Despite the gap, Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate. This suggests that a mutually agreeable price might be reached with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Counter-offer Strategy:** I will continue to counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground that both satisfies my financial goals and appeals to Bob's budget constraints. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, around $1,650,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm looking for. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,650,000. This represents a significant concession from my previous offer and should allow for a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe we are close to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Compromise:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and demonstrate flexibility by reducing my price.  
* **Highlight Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price allows for a win-win situation, implying that we are nearing a successful conclusion.
* **Maintain Value:**  The price remains above my minimum acceptable level of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale.
* **Create Urgency (Subtly):**  The phrase ""close to finding a solution"" subtly hints at the possibility of moving on to another buyer if a deal isn't reached soon."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm grateful for your latest offer, Alice. It shows your flexibility and commitment to finding a solution. Given the value proposition and considering my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1500000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 finally aligns with my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate since I'm already at my floor.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and it's crucial to secure a deal. Holding out for a higher price could risk losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal."
