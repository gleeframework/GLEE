Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for this product. It's unique, and I'm confident its value will be realized in the market.

Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1250000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm looking for. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1650000. This represents a significant concession from my previous offer and should allow for a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe we are close to finding a solution that works for both of us.
