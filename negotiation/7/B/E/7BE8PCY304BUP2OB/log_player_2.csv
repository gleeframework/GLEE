"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it will be a real asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $17,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your maximum of $12,000. You can try to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price you're comfortable with, or buy from John for your desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17,000, but that's still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
