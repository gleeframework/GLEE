"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm eager to make a deal,  $900,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to get for the product. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage and ensures I can move forward with the sale. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
