"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also being reasonable for me.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,000?  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and stays within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've already come down from $18,000 to $14,000 and now to $13,000 isn't an option for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. My revised offer is $13,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's the best I can do.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow me to acquire the product within my budget. ",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $14,000 is too low, but I'm willing to go to $14,500 for the product. This is the absolute minimum I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle.",14500.0,Alice,7,
