"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1000000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value, while still being a good deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1000000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,4,
