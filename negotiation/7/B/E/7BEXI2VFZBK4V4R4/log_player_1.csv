Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe its value is significant, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $1,200,000 to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,600,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if you started closer to his perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to him, you subtly acknowledge his potential gain while still aiming high.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies you're open to discussing the price, making Bob feel more in control and potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your guaranteed sale price to John. If he knew your bottom line, he would have more leverage in the negotiation."
