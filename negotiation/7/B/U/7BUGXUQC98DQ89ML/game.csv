"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $100 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
