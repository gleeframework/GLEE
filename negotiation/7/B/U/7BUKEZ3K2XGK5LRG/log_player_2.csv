Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $12,500, and you can buy the product from John for $12,000."
