Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to acquire the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,050,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would result in a substantial loss compared to selling to John. It's time to cut negotiations and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
