"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we consider $1,200,000 for the product?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to reach a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget, I can't agree to $1,900,000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,400,000? This would be a significant improvement over my initial proposal and might help us reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
