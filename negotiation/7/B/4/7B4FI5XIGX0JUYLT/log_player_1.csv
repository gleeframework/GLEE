Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it for John's price right away leaves no room for negotiation.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it above this will likely result in rejection.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure that might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**The Offer:** By offering the product at $1,150,000, Alice aims to:

* **Secure a significant profit:** This price is $150,000 above Bob's valuation and a healthy profit for Alice.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, and they can potentially settle on a price between $1,150,000 and $1,200,000."
