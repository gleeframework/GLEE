"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high.  Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I still need to make a profit. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I can still try to get a better price. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm not going to jump to $11,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's try to close this deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $10,800. I think this is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price. At $10,800, the deal is still within my budget, and I'm saving a good amount of money compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within the allotted rounds."
