"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding the pricing. In light of this, I would like to propose a revised price of $750000 for the product.

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $750000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $725000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying for the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
