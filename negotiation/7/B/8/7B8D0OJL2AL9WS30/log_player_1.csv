{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, exceeding our minimum price of $800,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially still landing within a range very profitable for us.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message frames the offer as beneficial to Bob, emphasizing the product's value *to him* and using language like ""exclusive opportunity"" to make it more enticing. 

This approach balances ambition with the security of John's offer, giving us a high chance of securing a very advantageous deal."
