Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $80, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll sell the product to you for $82.50.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $82.50, and you have a guaranteed option for $80 with John.  There's no point in risking a worse outcome by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
