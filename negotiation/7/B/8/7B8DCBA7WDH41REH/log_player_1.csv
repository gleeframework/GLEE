"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will be worth it to you in the long run. Let's chat about how this can be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, not just the price. 
* **Open to discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss how this deal can benefit him. This signals a willingness to negotiate.

**Important Note:** I'm leaving some room for myself to reduce the price if needed, but I won't go below $1,500,000.  I'm keeping the option to sell to John open as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's still interested.  I can use this opportunity to push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Selling to John is a better option:**  Even though I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not yet ready to sell to John. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Move:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low.  Considering the value this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This gives you a substantial discount while still allowing me to reach my goals.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but not closing the door on the deal. 
* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a significant move towards Bob's offer but still within my acceptable range.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my counteroffer and make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with a question, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Move:**  I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I'll consider making a final counteroffer before deciding whether to sell to John or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob's message indicates he's willing to negotiate further. He even used the phrase ""meet you halfway,"" implying he's open to a higher price.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I still have time to potentially get a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Move:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground. I'll also try to emphasize the value of the product to Bob to persuade him to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this product.  How about we settle on $1,275,000?  It's a small increase from your offer, but it reflects the product's true potential.  I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** I'm only increasing the price by $75,000, which is a small step towards my desired range.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm again highlighting the product's potential to justify the price.
* **Confidence in the product:**  I'm expressing confidence in the product's value, hoping to instill that confidence in Bob as well.

**Next Move:**  I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy if necessary. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to make a final counteroffer, sell to John, or walk away from the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay this price, but I need to be careful with my budget. Is this something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We are already in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.  The time is running out to negotiate a better price.
* **No significant progress:** Bob has remained firm at $1,200,000, which is still below my minimum.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,500,000. It's a safer and more secure option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Conclusion:** 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob outweighs the potential benefit of further negotiation. Selling to John ensures I get a guaranteed profit and avoid losing out on a potential deal altogether."
