"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low.  Considering the value this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This gives you a substantial discount while still allowing me to reach my goals.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this product.  How about we settle on $1,275,000?  It's a small increase from your offer, but it reflects the product's true potential.  I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
