"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal happen. I think that's a fair compromise, don't you?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant discount while still reflecting the true value of this product.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
