"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm starting the conversation at $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal happen. I think that's a fair compromise, don't you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $800,000. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant discount while still reflecting the true value of this product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John, who offers the product at a price within Bob's budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and the risk of exceeding Bob's budget is too high."
