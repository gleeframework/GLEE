"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me. While I'm interested in the product, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I've done my research and I believe the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still think $925,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $1,050,000. I'm confident we can meet in the middle from here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $1,050,000 is pushing it for my budget. I'm willing to offer $975,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're serious about this, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. Let's try $1,025,000. I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close! I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,000,000, but that's absolutely my limit. I think that's a fair offer considering the value we both bring to the table. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"I can see you're really serious about this, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I've got to think about my own bottom line. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's try $1,050,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think we're really close to a deal now.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
