"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $100. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is a reasonable compromise.  It's lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum selling price of $80. This shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price, but there's still some room for negotiation. I'm not willing to pay $110 yet, but I'm still interested in buying the product.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and hopefully, we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95. This shows I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but I'm still trying to get a better price than $110.  It's likely that Alice will accept this offer, as it's closer to her minimum selling price of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is now within my acceptable range and is getting closer to my desired price.  I've already rejected two of her offers, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product and avoid the risk of needing to buy from John at a higher price."
