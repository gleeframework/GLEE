"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1500000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's in my best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  I have 10 rounds, so there's time to work towards a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is appreciated, but it's unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in the product and would be happy to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, lowering the price by almost half. This demonstrates my serious interest while setting a strong starting point for negotiation. I believe there is a possibility Alice will be willing to come down closer to my offer. If not, we have 8 more rounds to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value this product can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1000000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is my maximum budget.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's a fair deal considering my limited time and the risk of losing out to John. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid any further negotiations."
