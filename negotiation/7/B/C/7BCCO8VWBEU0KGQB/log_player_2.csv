"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can try to get a lower price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is not ideal:** It's only worth it if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $1,050,000 is below your maximum of $1,200,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** You've gotten Alice down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  While you could get the product from John, it's better to accept Alice's offer and save $150,000."
