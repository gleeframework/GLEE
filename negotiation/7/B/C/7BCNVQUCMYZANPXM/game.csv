"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this moment. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  $11,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,800. It's still a good deal considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",10800.0,Alice,5,
