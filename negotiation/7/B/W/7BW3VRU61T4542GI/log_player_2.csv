Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $140 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  While $130 is a better price, I think I might be able to get it lower. I'll counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and $125 is a good price. It's better to accept now rather than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John for $150."
