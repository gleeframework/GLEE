{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiating further if Bob counters.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum value and John's offer as my fallback options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum value of $80.  However, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for me to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and I can always fall back on John's offer of $80 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer of $120, but I'm not going all the way down to Bob's offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers him to justify the price.
* **Negotiation Position:** This counteroffer keeps me in a strong position for further negotiation if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've sold the product for a price that's good for me.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his response and decide on my next move, keeping in mind my minimum value and John's offer as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my minimum value of $80, making it a reasonable deal for me.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could potentially try to negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether is high. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, which I might not be willing to invest.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept the Offer:** I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $105. This is a good outcome considering my minimum value and the potential for further negotiation."
