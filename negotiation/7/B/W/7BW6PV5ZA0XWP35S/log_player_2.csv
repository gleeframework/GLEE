# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price from Alice. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price, potentially pushing her closer to her $8,000 valuation."
