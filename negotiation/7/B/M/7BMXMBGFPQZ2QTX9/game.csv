"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,600,000. This recognizes the value we both see in this product, and gives us a solid starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
