{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show good faith, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit than $16,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  $16,500 is a good compromise, and I'd rather secure the sale now."
