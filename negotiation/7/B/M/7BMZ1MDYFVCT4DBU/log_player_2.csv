"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is higher than your maximum value for the product. You have room to negotiate a better price. Buying from John right now would be settling for your maximum price without attempting to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer leaves room for negotiation. While this offer is a significant jump down, it expresses strong interest in a lower price point. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a highly favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into preparing it for sale. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice reduced her price, but it's still above your target and John's price. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,750?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

**Reasoning:** We're aiming for a middle ground between the previous two offers. This shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a price significantly below Alice's current offer and closer to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the effort I've put into preparing it for sale. I hope you'll consider this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While it's not ideal, it's getting close to John's price. Accepting now guarantees a saving compared to buying from John, and avoids the risk of Alice walking away from the negotiation."
