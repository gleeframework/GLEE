"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing it for $750000.  This would be a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my original asking price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's close to your offer and within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.",815000.0,Alice,5,
