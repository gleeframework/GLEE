Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still leaves you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
