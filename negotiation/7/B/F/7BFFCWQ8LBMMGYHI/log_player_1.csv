Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum desired price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this shows good faith and encourages Bob to accept, as we are getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $95 is too low for me. Selling to John for $120 ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoid further negotiation."
