"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the product's potential, but that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable return while ensuring you have significant upside potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
