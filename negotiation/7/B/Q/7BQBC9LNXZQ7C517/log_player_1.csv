Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This avoids any confusion and keeps the negotiation moving forward.

By starting with a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiating range before potentially lowering the price. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept an offer that undervalues the product. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for a product worth more than that to me.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price.  I want to see if we can bridge the remaining gap before I consider selling to John. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also starting to feel like this negotiation might be going nowhere."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $8,500, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference and settle on $9,250.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep the product in the market I'm targeting.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
