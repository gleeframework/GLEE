{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a good starting point because it's closer to my value ($15,000) than Bob's ($12,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly.  
* **Plan B:**  I'm also prepared to sell to John for $15,000, so I have a safety net. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I want to make as much money as possible, I'm not desperate.  I can counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle. 
* **Plan B:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always a good option, but I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my asking price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $13,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $13,000 splits the difference between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the value for Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not losing too much if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to meet in the middle, I am committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate at $12,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Plan B is Always There:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sticking with this. I can go a little lower, but $12,800 is my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession by lowering my price from $13,000 to $12,800. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my bottom line. 
* **Final Offer:** I'm stating this is my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 

This is my last offer before I seriously consider selling to John."
