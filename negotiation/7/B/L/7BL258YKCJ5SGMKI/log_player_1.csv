"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let's start the negotiation and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth more to me to keep negotiating with Bob, as I'm confident I can get a better price.  It's also worth noting that I can still sell to John for a much higher price if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, and I am willing to meet you closer to your price. How about we settle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is closer to my goal, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm not willing to accept a deal that's less than $800,000, as that's what the product is worth to me. I'm also not in a rush to sell, as I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to work with you, but $700,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I appreciate you working with me. I could go up to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $800,000. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, giving me a significant buffer and allowing me to hold out for a better offer from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of the negotiation, but $750,000 is still not enough for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our time. I believe this is the best we can do, let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
