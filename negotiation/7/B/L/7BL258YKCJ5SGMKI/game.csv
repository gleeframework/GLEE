"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, and I am willing to meet you closer to your price. How about we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to work with you, but $700,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of the negotiation, but $750,000 is still not enough for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our time. I believe this is the best we can do, let's finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
