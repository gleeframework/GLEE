"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Framing it as Fair:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Room for Compromise:** This gives Bob room to negotiate down, but still leaves me with a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting the offer signals that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Strong Position:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $800,000, providing me with a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to meet Bob halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like I'm genuinely trying to reach a deal.
* **Re-emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to justify the higher price point.
* **Confidence in Value:** I'm expressing confidence in the product and the potential for it to be a good investment for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the product, and I believe it's worth the investment. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and significantly higher than the guaranteed sale with John.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate might result in Bob walking away or lowering his offer even further. 
* **Secure Profit:**  Accepting the offer guarantees a substantial profit, minimizing risk and securing a quick sale."
