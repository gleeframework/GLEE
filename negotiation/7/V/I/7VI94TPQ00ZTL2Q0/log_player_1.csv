Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason like ""a steal"" or ""great deal"" aims to nudge Bob towards perceiving the value as higher.
* **Alternative Option:** By implicitly hinting at another buyer (John), we create a sense of urgency and scarcity. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
