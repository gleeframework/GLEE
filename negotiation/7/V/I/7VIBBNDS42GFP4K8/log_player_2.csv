"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. How about $90 for the product? This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while considering your budget.

Alice's offer of $90 is still better than John's $100 offer, and it's closer to your ideal price. Accepting this offer allows you to save $10 compared to buying from John."
