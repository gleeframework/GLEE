Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and while I have other interested buyers, I believe you should have the first option. I'm willing to make this deal happen for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation and aims to secure the highest possible profit.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it slightly below John's offer ($1,000,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency & Exclusivity:**  Highlighting other buyers and presenting the offer as a ""first option"" encourages Bob to act quickly."
