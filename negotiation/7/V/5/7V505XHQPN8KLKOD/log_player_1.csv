Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000). This allows for room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Expressing confidence:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and uses positive language to make Bob more interested.
* **Keeping options open:**  While I'm confident in selling to Bob, I'm also aware of the John option, which acts as a safety net."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for potential profit. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the next step and send a counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:** While I'm hoping for a better deal with Bob, knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 provides me with a solid fallback option."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is closer, I still need to make a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the product. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable price. 
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant drop from my original offer to make the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Positive and persuasive:** I'm using positive language (""finalize this deal"") to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategic considerations:**

* This price is still significantly higher than my minimum, giving me some buffer if Bob counteroffers again. 
* I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing the negotiation:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push him further.
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue the negotiation without losing too much.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to try to get a better price from Bob if possible.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to $13,000 or $13,500.  I will keep my counteroffers within a reasonable range, but also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,200. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work. Let's shake hands and finalize this."", ""product_price"": 13200} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's almost exactly in between our last two offers, showing a willingness to be flexible.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language (""make this deal work"", ""shake hands"") to create a sense of finality and encourage acceptance.
* **Maintaining value:**  The price is still significantly higher than my minimum, ensuring I'm not selling myself short.

**Strategic considerations:**

* This is a middle ground that hopefully appeals to Bob's desire for a good deal while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll have to consider whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John. However, I'm hopeful this offer will be accepted."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close, but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling.  
* **Remaining rounds:** We have 4 rounds left, and with my minimum being $10,000, there's still potential to negotiate a better deal. 
* **Avoid selling to John:** I'm still hopeful that I can get a higher price from Bob, and selling to John at this point would mean leaving money on the table. 

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, perhaps $13,000 or $13,100. I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and adjust my offers accordingly. However, I will also keep a close eye on the remaining rounds and be prepared to accept a lower price if necessary."

```

* **Maintaining value:** I'm still confident in the product's value and not selling myself short.

**Strategic considerations:**

* This offer is a ""last chance"" compromise before considering selling to John.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll have to reassess the situation and potentially make a final counteroffer before switching to the John option."

Round 8

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Two rounds left:** I'm running out of time, but I'm still determined to get a better price from Bob.
* **John as a backup:**  I'm aware that selling to John is my fallback option, but I'm not ready to do that yet.
* **Potential for a higher price:** I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay more if I make a strong final counteroffer.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. I'm willing to go down to $13,000 for the product.  I know we've been back and forth, but I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's seal the deal now. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last counteroffer, leaving no room for further negotiation. 
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm framing this as a fair price for both of us, emphasizing that I'm making a significant concession.
* **Setting a deadline:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by stating that I will move on to another buyer if we can't agree.

**Strategic considerations:**

* This is a risky move, as I'm leaving myself with only one round to accept Bob's offer if he rejects.
* However, I'm confident that $13,000 is still a good price for me, and this last-ditch effort might be enough to convince Bob to accept.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to accept John's $10,000 offer, which is better than nothing but not ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. This is my last offer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final round:**  This is the last round of negotiation, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Risk of losing out:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer carries the risk of Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with nothing.
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale and secures at least my minimum value. 

**Conclusion:** While it's disappointing to not get a higher price, selling to John is the most rational decision in this final round. It ensures I get at least my minimum value and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all."
