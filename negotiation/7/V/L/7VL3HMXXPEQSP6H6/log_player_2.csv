"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly below Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to gauge her flexibility and willingness to deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming lower. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $75? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're incrementally increasing our offer to show willingness, but we're still holding firm below her price. This keeps the pressure on Alice while demonstrating our genuine interest in reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference -  how about $80?  This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her minimum price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and we're getting a good deal compared to John's offer."
