"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. I understand it's a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects that.  It's also a fair price for me, as I have a guaranteed sale for $1,500,000 if we can't come to an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving you $200,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. There's a chance she might come back with a lower offer closer to your limit.  Even if she doesn't, you haven't lost anything by rejecting and proceeding with John."
