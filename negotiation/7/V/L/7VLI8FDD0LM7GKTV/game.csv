"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $925,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $925,000, so I'm thinking of $887,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $887,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price is fair considering the value you place on the product, and it's the best I can do at this point. I'm confident that this deal will be profitable for both of us.
