Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $925,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $925,000, so I'm thinking of $887,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to what I want, I'm still not at the price point I'd prefer.  I have several rounds left and want to push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $887,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still willing to pay $890,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm not willing to go any higher. Can we finalize the deal at this price?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I only have two rounds left.  There's a good chance Bob won't budge, and selling to John would net me less.  $890,000 is a decent outcome considering the negotiation."
