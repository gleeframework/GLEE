I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept. This allows some room for negotiation while still being a good deal for me."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $750,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $750,000 is still a good amount, it's below my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and while he's willing to pay a good price, we're still a bit far apart. I'm not confident we'll reach a deal soon, and I'd rather not risk losing more time and money. Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed sale, and it's within my minimum threshold."
