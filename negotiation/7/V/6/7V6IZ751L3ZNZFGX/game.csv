"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to be closer to the true value of the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I understand the product's value, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $750,000? That's a fair offer considering your initial asking price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
