Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.
