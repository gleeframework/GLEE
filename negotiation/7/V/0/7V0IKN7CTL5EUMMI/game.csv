"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit shy of my target. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? That would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  While I can't go as low as $8,200, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $8,400? That's a fair compromise and it would allow us to close this deal. We're both getting closer to what we want, and this price feels like a win for both of us. What do you say?",8400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",8250.0,Bob,8,
