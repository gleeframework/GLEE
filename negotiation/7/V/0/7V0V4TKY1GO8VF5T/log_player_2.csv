"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product for more than its value to her ($10,000). Her opening offer of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Your Leverage:** You have an alternative (John) willing to sell at $15,000, but you want a better price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. She'll likely come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale."
