"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this incredible product. I truly believe it can significantly benefit you. Given its potential value, I propose an initial offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to you and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your desire to save money. It's also not unreasonable, considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.
* **Sets the Stage for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation process and gives Alice room to counter with a higher price, potentially finding a middle ground. 
* **Leaves Room for Further Negotiation:**  By starting at $950,000, you have room to make further concessions if necessary, without exceeding your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding the value of this product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  How about we meet in the middle of our last offers at $987,500?  I'm confident this price is fair considering both of our perspectives."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Negotiation:** This counteroffer shows that you're serious about finding a deal but are still working towards a lower price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting a price halfway between your last offer and Alice's, you create a sense of fairness and compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:**  The offer is still within your budget, allowing for some further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I believe your current offer undervalues the significant benefits this product brings. It's not just about meeting in the middle, but recognizing its true worth. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the immense value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above what you're comfortable with.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially get a better price without exceeding your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, and I'm sure this product is valuable.  However,  $1,010,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Let's split the difference between our last offers at $998,750. This would be a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this time."", ""product_price"": 998750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still advocating for a lower price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This tactic reinforces the idea of fairness and potentially encourages Alice to accept.
* **Close to the Limit:** This offer is very close to your desired price range, leaving little room for further concessions."
