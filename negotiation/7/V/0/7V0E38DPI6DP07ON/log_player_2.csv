"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which holds significant value for us at $15,000. Given its worth and potential benefits to you, I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Considering its value to you is $12,000, I propose we strike a fair deal. Would you be interested in discussing this further or making an offer that suits both of our expectations? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum price of $12,000.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at your target price. There's no need to settle for a higher price."
