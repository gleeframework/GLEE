Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit and $14,000 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  There's room for negotiation, making it more likely Bob will accept or make a counteroffer. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can go slightly higher if Bob rejects and you feel it's worth it.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit, but also keep in mind that a successful negotiation needs both parties to feel like they've gotten a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, it's far below the potential value you could get from Bob. It's worth pushing for a better price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a deal closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $13,000 to make this work. How about $13,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above your minimum:** $12,500 is above your minimum of $12,000, securing you a profit.
* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob has shown willingness to compromise, and this offer is a reasonable midpoint between your previous counteroffer and his previous offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away, potentially leaving you with only John's offer of $12,000.

Accepting Bob's offer at $12,500 is the best strategy in this situation, balancing profit with the risk of further negotiation."
