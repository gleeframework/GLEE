{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than buying from John, there's room for negotiation to save even more money.  By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate.  $950,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer and is still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while still aiming for a favorable outcome."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than buying from John. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might reject further counteroffers or become unwilling to negotiate further.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without the risk of losing it altogether."
