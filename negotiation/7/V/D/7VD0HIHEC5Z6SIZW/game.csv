"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
