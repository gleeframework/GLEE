"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price point to make it work.  Would you be willing to consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is significantly below its value to you. It's time to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, I'm looking to keep this purchase under $1,000,000.  Would you be open to a price of $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. Let's see if we can bring him up a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your desired budget. How about we settle on $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a big leap from what I'm willing to spend.  I need to see this closer to the $800,000 mark to make sense for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $850,000 is still too low. We're entering a phase where it's worth pushing a little harder to see if we can secure a better deal with Bob before resorting to John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I recognize your position and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. How about we land at $1,200,000? This feels like a win-win for both of us."",
