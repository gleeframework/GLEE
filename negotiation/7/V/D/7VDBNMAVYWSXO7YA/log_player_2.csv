Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 is too low for me to consider.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I recognize your position and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. How about we land at $1,200,000? This feels like a win-win for both of us.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down, she's still significantly over my budget.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with within the remaining rounds. It's simply not worth the risk of exceeding my budget or ending up with no deal at all. John offers a guaranteed purchase at my target price."
