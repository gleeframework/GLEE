"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
