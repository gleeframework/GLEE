Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low. There's room for negotiation, and starting higher gives us that space.
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Counter-Offer:** A price of $125 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer with a higher price that's still below our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Balancing Potential Profit and Risk:** This price point balances the potential for higher profit (if Bob accepts) with the risk of losing him as a buyer (in which case we still have John as a guaranteed sale at $150)."
