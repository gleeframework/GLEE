"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1100000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'll offer you $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $980000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be at $950000 or lower. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession to get to $980000, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go any lower than $975000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you at $960000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1000000.",960000.0,Bob,10,
