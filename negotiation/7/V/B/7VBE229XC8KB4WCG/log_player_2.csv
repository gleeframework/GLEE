"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible and the product is worth no more than $80 to Bob, rejecting the offer is the best initial choice. Bob can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Would you consider $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $82 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's a chance that Alice might be willing to negotiate further, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to try to get a better price."
