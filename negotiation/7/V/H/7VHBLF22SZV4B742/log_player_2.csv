"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is higher than your maximum valuation and what John offers. You should reject this offer and begin negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 750000} 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower offer  accomplishes a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:** It helps determine how much Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Sets a strong anchor:**  Even if Alice rejects it outright, it sets a lower reference point for future counter-offers.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's space to gradually increase the offer if needed while staying well below John's $1,000,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, it's still higher than John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation before considering accepting a price above $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. To be completely transparent with you, I have another offer for $1,000,000. If you're able to come down to $850,000, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reveal John's offer (partially):** By revealing you have another offer at $1,000,000 (without revealing the source), you add credibility to your position and pressure Alice to negotiate seriously.
* **Set a firm but fair counter:**  $850,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a substantial saving from John's price. 
* **Convey urgency and willingness to close:** By stating you're ready to buy at $850,000, you signal that this is a serious offer, potentially pushing Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about the other offer, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is as close to the original offer as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $900,000. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to buy from John.  While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, the potential savings are not worth the risk of her refusing and leaving you with no deal."
