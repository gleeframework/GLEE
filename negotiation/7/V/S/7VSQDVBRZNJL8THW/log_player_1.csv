"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is still attractive to Bob, but also allows you room to bargain if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. I'm willing to pay $95 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, it's still below the $100 you offered in the first round. You want to see if you can push for a higher price, as the product is worth $120 to Bob. By rejecting this offer, you can make a counter-offer and see if Bob is willing to move closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $98?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you. Let's try to find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $95. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stood firm at $95, and we've reached a point where there's little room for further negotiation.  While we'd ideally get closer to $100,  $95 is a solid price and better than selling to John for $80.  There's a risk that rejecting the offer will lead to further stalemates or Bob backing out altogether.  It's time to secure the deal."
