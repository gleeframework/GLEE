Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer Alice could send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $11,500. I know how valuable this is and believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's perceived value leaves room for potential counter-offers, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency (Implied):**  By mentioning her other buyer (John) indirectly, Alice subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is prone to negotiation, she might start even higher. 
* **Market Conditions:**  The availability of similar products could influence Alice's pricing strategy."
