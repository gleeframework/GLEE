"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest a bit less in it. How about we settle around $650,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest less in the product, but I'm still looking to get a good value for it. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $700,000? This gets us closer to a deal, and I'm hoping we can avoid going back and forth too much more.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
