"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest a bit less in it. How about we settle around $650,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest less in the product, but I'm still looking to get a good value for it. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still giving me a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $700,000? This gets us closer to a deal, and I'm hoping we can avoid going back and forth too much more."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $775,000, and we have a guaranteed option at $800,000 with John. It's better to secure a small saving than risk losing out entirely by continuing to negotiate."
