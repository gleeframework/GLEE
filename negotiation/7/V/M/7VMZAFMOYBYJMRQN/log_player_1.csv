Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but I believe it gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.  I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so anything above that is a win.  

I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if Bob rejects my initial offer. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
