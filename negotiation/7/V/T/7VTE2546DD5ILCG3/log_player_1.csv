"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $75 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $78, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I am eager to sell the product, I have already rejected a lower offer and have 6 more rounds to negotiate. I will try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. $78 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $82. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $82, which would be $80. Can you accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I've only got four rounds left to negotiate. However, the potential for further negotiation seems low given Bob's previous counteroffers and his statement that he cannot go higher.  

Selling to John for $100 is the best option at this point, as it guarantees a price above my minimum threshold and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
