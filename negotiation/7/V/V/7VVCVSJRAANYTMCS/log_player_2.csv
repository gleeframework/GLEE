# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to save even more, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,350,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $1,380,000? This is a compromise that still allows you to get a great deal, while also recognizing the value of the product to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $1,365,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. How about we meet at $1,375,000? This is a price that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also acknowledging your desire for a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, and we're getting close to my target.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk of reaching a stalemate or Alice deciding to sell to someone else.  Accepting the offer at $1,375,000 is a good compromise,  saving me $125,000 compared to John's offer."
