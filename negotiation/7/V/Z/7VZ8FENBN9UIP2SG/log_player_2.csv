"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's start with a fair price. How about $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still too high. You want to save as much money as possible, and there are more rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
