"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss selling you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm aiming for a price around $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still a bit too high, and there are rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Bob is taking a bold step here, offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about getting a good deal and sets a firm starting point for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  He justifies the offer by acknowledging the product's value but highlighting his price limitations. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $12,000 is still significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($8,000), giving her room to counter without losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product really does offer a lot of value, especially in your line of work. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Good Deal:** $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a good deal for him, saving him $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or having Alice become less flexible outweighs the potential of saving an additional $1,000."
