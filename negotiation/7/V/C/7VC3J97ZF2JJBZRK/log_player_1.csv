Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  your offer of $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 3

I understand that's a bit above your budget, but I'm confident the product's value is worth more to you than that. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still below my target price.

Let's see if we can make a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
