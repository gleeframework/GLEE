"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95. This is a good deal, but you can potentially do better. You'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still aiming for a lower price. You can likely get the product for less than $90. You'll reject this offer and try for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we compromise at $88? It's closer to my budget and still gives you a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $89. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've successfully negotiated the price down to $89, which is a good deal for you. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  You're saving $11 compared to buying from John, so it's a good outcome."
