"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we compromise at $88? It's closer to my budget and still gives you a fair profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a price closer to $90.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
