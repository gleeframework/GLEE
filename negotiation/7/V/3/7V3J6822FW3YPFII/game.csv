"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we compromise at $88? It's closer to my budget and still gives you a fair profit.",88.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $89. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",89.0,Alice,5,
