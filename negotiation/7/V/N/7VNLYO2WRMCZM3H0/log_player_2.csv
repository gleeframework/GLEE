"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I think it's worth $120 to you, considering its unique features and benefits. It's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Max Value:** You're willing to pay up to $150.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $120.
* **John's Offer:** John is selling the product for $150, which is your maximum.

**Strategy:** Since you can get the product from John for your maximum price, it's beneficial to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with John in the future or find a better deal elsewhere."
