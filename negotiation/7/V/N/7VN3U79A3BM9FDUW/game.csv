"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a generous offer, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $700,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $850,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
