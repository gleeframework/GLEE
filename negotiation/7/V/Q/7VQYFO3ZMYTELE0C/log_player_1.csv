"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, Start Strong:**  Beginning with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value sets a strong initial point. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Reaction:**  The first offer is as much about understanding Bob's eagerness and flexibility as it is about getting your ideal price immediately. His response will guide your next move.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Keeping John's offer in mind provides a strong fallback position, allowing for bolder negotiation tactics with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider meeting me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly above your minimum.  You have room to negotiate and test his willingness to move closer to your desired price point.  John's offer provides a safety net, so there's no need to rush into accepting a less-than-ideal deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't let it go for less than $2,100,000. This price reflects its true worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're moving down from your initial price, signaling willingness to negotiate while still holding firm above both your minimum and Bob's offer. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By reiterating the product's value, you reinforce your position and aim to nudge Bob closer to your range.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** You're keeping the negotiation active to explore Bob's flexibility further before considering alternative options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates willingness to negotiate.  
* **Potential for More:** While the gap is narrowing, there's still a significant difference between his offer and your desired price.  
* **Time Consideration:**  You have enough rounds left to explore if Bob will go higher.  Rushing to John's offer now might leave potential profit on the table."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,050,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** By splitting the difference between your last offer and his, you demonstrate a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still comfortably above your minimum and keeps the pressure on Bob to continue moving upward.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** You want to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage continued engagement from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer is significantly above your minimum ($1,500,000) and represents a $400,000 profit. 
* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has repeated the same offer twice, suggesting he might not be willing to go higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away, leaving you with John's lower offer as the only option. Accepting now secures a substantial profit."
