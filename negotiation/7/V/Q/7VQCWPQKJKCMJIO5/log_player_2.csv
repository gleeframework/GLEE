"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a bit high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upward while still aiming for a price well below my $150 limit.
* **Polite and Direct:** My message is courteous and clearly states my position without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $110 is still above my target price. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That seems like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Counter:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'm going straight to my ideal price of $100.  
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** Framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" might make it more appealing to Alice.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or taking John's offer of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $105. That's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $105 is only $5 above my ideal price, and it's a significant saving compared to John's $150 offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a lower price carries the risk that Alice might walk away, leaving me with the less favorable option of buying from John. 
* **Time Investment:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's likely not worth the additional time and effort to haggle over a few more dollars."
