Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts. Here's why:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  $1,400,000 is still a great deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Profitable for Alice:**  This offer generates a $400,000 profit for Alice, which is significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.

**However, remember:**

* This is just a starting point. You could adjust the price based on Bob's reaction, his negotiation style, and your assessment of how much he really wants the product. 
* If Bob rejects, you always have the option to lower the price slightly to incentivize him, but never go below your minimum price of $1,000,000."
