"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132? I'm sure we can make this work.",132.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for $132, but I'm still limited to $125.  Let's split the difference and go with $128.  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that.  $128 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This is my final offer.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
