Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your needs, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, maximizing profit means getting the highest price possible from Bob first.
* **Find a Balance:** Offering the product for $1,200,000 to Bob is unlikely to be accepted since it's worth less to him.  We need to offer a price that's appealing to Bob while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**The offer of $1,150,000:**

* **Profitable for Alice:**  It's significantly more than her minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Attractive to Bob:** It offers him a potential savings of $50,000 from his perceived value.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a premium price while having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
