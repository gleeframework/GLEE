Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. What do you think?,10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
