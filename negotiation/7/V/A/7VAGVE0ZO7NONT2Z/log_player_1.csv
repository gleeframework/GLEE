"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product you'll find immensely beneficial."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob helps justify the initial high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording ""proposing"" and ""starting point"" makes it clear that Alice is open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($800,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000).  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $700,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $850,000. This reflects the immense value it offers and provides a win-win scenario for both of us."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($700,000) and the previous asking price ($950,000) shows flexibility while still aiming high. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces its worth in Bob's mind, justifying the higher price.
* **""Win-Win"" Framing:**  Positioning the counteroffer as mutually beneficial encourages Bob to consider it favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of its value and would allow me to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! While $775,000 is closer to your minimum, we're still in a negotiation. Bob clearly sees the value and is willing to pay more than your backup offer. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this deal.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $815,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly reflects the product's worth while recognizing your investment."",
""product_price"": 815000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal seriousness and limit further back-and-forth. 
* **Slight Concession:** Moving down slightly to $815,000 shows some flexibility while staying above your absolute minimum.
* **Justification:** Emphasizing this is a final offer due to your valuation reinforces the idea you're already making a concession. 
* **Urgency:**  By making it a ""final offer,"" you introduce a sense of urgency for Bob to either accept a still-good deal or risk losing out."
