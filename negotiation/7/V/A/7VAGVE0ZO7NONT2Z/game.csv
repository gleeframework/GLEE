"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $700,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $850,000. This reflects the immense value it offers and provides a win-win scenario for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of its value and would allow me to close the deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this deal.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $815,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly reflects the product's worth while recognizing your investment.",815000.0,Alice,5,
