Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to pay more, and you can negotiate if he counteroffers. 
* **It's a strong initial offer:** Showing you're willing to be flexible, but still have a high price point, can make Bob more likely to negotiate seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our mutual interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and closer to your minimum. By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Show you're not desperate:**  Rejecting the offer communicates that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right, making you appear less willing to settle.
* **Maintain leverage:** You can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and brings you closer to your desired price.
* **Increase your potential gains:**  Bob might be willing to negotiate further to reach an agreement. 

It's important to remember that you can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'd be willing to accept $1,400,000. This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This counteroffer is a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's. It shows a willingness to compromise without immediately accepting a low price. 
* **Justifying the price:**  Highlighting the product's value to you gives Bob a reason to reconsider.
* **Offering a win-win:**  Framing it as a good deal for both parties can make Bob more receptive to the offer.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while staying firm on your desire for a price closer to your ideal. You still have the option to sell to John if Bob ultimately rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll consider it carefully. In response, I would like to propose a price of $1,375,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 less than your counteroffer and is within a reasonable range of your ideal price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, and there's no guarantee Bob will come up to your desired amount.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Time spent negotiating with Bob takes away from potential opportunities to find other buyers who may be willing to pay more.

While it's not your ideal price, accepting Bob's offer offers a good balance between securing a sale and minimizing the risk of a lower price or further negotiation. You can always use the time saved to explore other potential buyers in the future."
