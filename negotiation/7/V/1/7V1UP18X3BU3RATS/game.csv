"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually agreeable price point.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd like to propose $950,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I can't go below $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise already.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still out of my budget. I'd like to propose one last time: $950,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",950000.0,Bob,6,
