"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
