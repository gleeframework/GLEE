"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own assessment of its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",675000.0,Alice,3,
