# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  While $700,000 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own assessment of its value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $675,000 is a decent price, saving you $125,000 compared to John.  It's worth accepting this offer."
