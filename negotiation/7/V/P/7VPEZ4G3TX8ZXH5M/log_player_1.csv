"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum value of $12,000.  Bob's offer was way too low, but hopefully, he'll see that this is a fair price considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'll counteroffer again, but I might start thinking about selling to John if this continues."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $11,000, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping to close the deal quickly, but I'm starting to get concerned that Bob might not be serious about buying at a fair price. If he rejects this offer, I might start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not ready to sell at $10,500. It's getting close, but I'm going to counteroffer one more time before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,750. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it's enough to sway Bob.  If he rejects this, I'm seriously going to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  He's clearly not willing to meet my minimum value.  John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000, which is better than the current offer from Bob. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
