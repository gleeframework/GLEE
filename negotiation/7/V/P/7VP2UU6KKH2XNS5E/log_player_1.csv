"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still within the range of what Bob would be willing to pay. This allows room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a good price if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value of this product and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already halfway through the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $1,350,000 is a good price and ensures I make a profit while securing the sale."
