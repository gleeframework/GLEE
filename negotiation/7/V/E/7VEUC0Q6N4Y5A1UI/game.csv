"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  your offer is enticing, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This price still provides you with a healthy profit and gives me a great deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still gives you a great deal, while also recognizing the product's true value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement. ",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
