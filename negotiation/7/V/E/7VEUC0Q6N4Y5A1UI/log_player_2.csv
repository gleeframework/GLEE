"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.  Buying from John immediately would cost you significantly more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  your offer is enticing, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This price still provides you with a healthy profit and gives me a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still gives you a great deal, while also recognizing the product's true value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial offer, but it's still higher than what I'm aiming for. I'm determined to get the price as low as possible, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Buying from John immediately would cost me significantly more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement. "", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer to pay even less, it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John at $1,500,000.  There's a chance she might come down further, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John is too high. It's a good deal for both of us and a good time to finalize the agreement."
