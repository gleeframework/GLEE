Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield a better outcome.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **Bob:**  Gets the product for $150,000 less than its perceived value to him.
    * **Alice:** Earns an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from lowballing.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice is comfortable with a degree of risk. If she wants a guaranteed $1,200,000, she should sell directly to John."
