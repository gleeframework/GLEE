Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, ensuring I don't lose money.

By offering the product at $14,000, I'm aiming for a significant profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
