"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000.
