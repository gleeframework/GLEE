"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Could we work something closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is substantial.  I could consider a price of $1,225,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my initial offer while acknowledging the product's worth.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,112,500?",1112500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. While $1,112,500 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we are definitely getting closer.  I can tell this product means a lot to you, and it is valuable.  How about we split the difference again and land at $1,143,750?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",1143750.0,Bob,6,
