"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a good price for both of us, considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle.  If you're not interested, I'll be happy to sell to another buyer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
