"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low, and I can always sell to John for $1,200,000. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a good price for both of us, considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $700,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm not in a rush to sell, so I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob or sell to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle.  If you're not interested, I'll be happy to sell to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
