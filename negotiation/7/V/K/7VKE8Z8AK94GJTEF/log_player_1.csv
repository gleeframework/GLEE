Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I recognize the potential of this product, your initial offer is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000, which reflects my maximum price point. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the $800,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's potential and my investment in it. To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000.  I believe this strikes a more balanced approach, recognizing the value it brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. To move forward, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, but also respects my financial limitations. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now showing some flexibility and has significantly increased his offer. However, we are still below John's offer, and there's room for negotiation. We'll continue to counter in hopes of getting closer to John's offer or exceeding it."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for working with me on this. Your latest offer shows me you're serious. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this recognizes the progress we've made while reflecting the true value of what I'm offering."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given our current negotiation.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now below John's guaranteed offer. While we could potentially negotiate Bob up slightly, there's no guarantee we'd reach $1,500,000. It's more strategic at this point to take John's sure offer."
