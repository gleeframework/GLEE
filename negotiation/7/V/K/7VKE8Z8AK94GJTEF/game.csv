"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects the asset's true worth and potential.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I recognize the potential of this product, your initial offer is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000, which reflects my maximum price point. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the $800,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's potential and my investment in it. To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000.  I believe this strikes a more balanced approach, recognizing the value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. To move forward, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, but also respects my financial limitations. Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for working with me on this. Your latest offer shows me you're serious. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this recognizes the progress we've made while reflecting the true value of what I'm offering.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given our current negotiation.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
