You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's always worth trying to negotiate. You can start by making a counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a bold move, but I'm hoping to quickly establish a lower price range and see if Alice is willing to play ball."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While I'd love to get it lower, there's no guarantee I can do better with further negotiation.  It's a fair price considering my alternative option is to buy from John at the same price."
