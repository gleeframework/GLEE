"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to still get a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,
