"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $1050000? I believe this would still provide a good return for you while allowing me to make the purchase.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1075000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, and while it's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I would like to propose an offer of $1060000 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between respecting the product's value and keeping my investment within my desired budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1060000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $1090000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
