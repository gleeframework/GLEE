Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 is still a significant profit margin for Alice. It also creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning other interested buyers, we subtly remind Bob that he might miss out if he doesn't act.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
