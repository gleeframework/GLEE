"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit. I'll also be mindful of the 10-round limit and John's offer as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below the value to him. It's too early to accept such a low offer. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap while keeping in mind John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a good profit, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and even though it's getting closer, it's not yet at a point where I'm comfortable accepting. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price, but keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $1,400,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not ready to sell for less than $1,400,000, especially with John as a backup option. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best way to ensure a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. However, $1,450,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's final offer is $1,400,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and given the limited rounds and the possibility of losing out on a higher price by selling to John, it's a good deal. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
