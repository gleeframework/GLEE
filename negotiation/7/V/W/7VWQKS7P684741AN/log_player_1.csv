Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000. This is a significant amount, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Bob's Value:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, I believe there's a good chance he'll find this offer attractive. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's $1,000,000 offer is a safety net, it's important to aim higher and try to extract more value from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further if needed. If he rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping John's offer as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and closer to John's offer. Accepting it would be a considerable loss for me.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it indicates he's still interested. Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, there's a chance I can get a better deal with Bob. The risk is that we might fail to reach an agreement, but the potential reward is a higher sale price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll need to carefully consider John's offer as a more secure option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer of $1,150,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to reach a deal. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 than my previous offer. This indicates a willingness to meet halfway and suggests a desire to close the deal.
* **Still Profitable:**  While this is lower than my ideal price, it still results in a substantial profit and is significantly higher than John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's response to this offer. If he accepts, the deal is closed. If he rejects, I'll have to re-evaluate the situation and consider John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer is now very close to John's offer, indicating a significant difference in our perceived value of the product.
* **Limited Upside:** Making another counteroffer might result in a lower price than John's offer. It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly at this point.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Selling to John guarantees a secure $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching a deal and ultimately getting a lower price.

**Conclusion:**

The negotiation has reached a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting John's offer is the safest and most reasonable choice."
