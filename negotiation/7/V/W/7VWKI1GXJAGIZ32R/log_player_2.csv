{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $95.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $100. It's the minimum I can accept for this product.  If you're willing to pay $100, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $100 is the same as John's price. Since I can get it for the same price from John, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice. I'll buy it from John."
