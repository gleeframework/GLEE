"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $95.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $100. It's the minimum I can accept for this product.  If you're willing to pay $100, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,5,
