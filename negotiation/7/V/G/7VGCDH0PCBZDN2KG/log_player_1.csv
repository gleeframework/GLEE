Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm aiming for a significant profit but still leave room for potential negotiation.  It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I can afford to be a little firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, but it's not unreasonable given the value to him. I'll counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to acquire a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I still feel that $950,000 is a reasonable price for the product. I would like to stick to that figure. If you're unable to meet my offer, I'll consider purchasing the product from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been firm on his price, and while I'm willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement that benefits me enough.  I'd rather secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk further negotiations with Bob."
