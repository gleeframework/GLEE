"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk. I'll be ready to adjust my price if Bob's counteroffer is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get more, and I have 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit. This shows flexibility to Bob while indicating that I'm not desperate to sell at his initial offer."
