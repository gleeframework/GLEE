Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, as you know this product is worth a lot more to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a price of $900,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives him room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for some give and take without compromising my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer. 
* I'll keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if I'm not satisfied with the negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiations:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my target price.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum value. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, considering the value this product brings. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining my value.
* **Middle Ground:** $875,000 is a compromise between our current positions. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is still friendly and encouraging, emphasizing mutual benefit.

**Next Steps:**

*  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll analyze his next offer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer.
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup, especially if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you reconsider and meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firmly stuck at $850,000, which is below my minimum value. Further negotiation is unlikely to change his stance.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and ultimately lead to a lower price or no deal at all. 
* **Guaranteed Value:**  John's offer guarantees me my minimum value of $1,000,000.  

**Next Steps:**

* I'll reach out to John and finalize the sale. It's the best option to secure the highest price and avoid further potential delays."
