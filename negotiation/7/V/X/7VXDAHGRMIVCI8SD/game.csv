"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  I think that's a fair offer considering it's worth $10,000 to you.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's try to find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",8000.0,Bob,4,
