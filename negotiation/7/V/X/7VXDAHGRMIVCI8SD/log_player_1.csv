Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  I think that's a fair offer considering it's worth $10,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $7,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $8,000 isn't my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and it's closer to my minimum price of $10,000 than John's offer."
