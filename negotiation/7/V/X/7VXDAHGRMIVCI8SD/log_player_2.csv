"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  I think that's a fair offer considering it's worth $10,000 to you."",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) than Alice's asking price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, I'm subtly reminding her of her potential profit margin even at my lower price. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The tone remains polite and respectful, which is important for maintaining a good negotiation dynamic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice came down in price, we still have room to negotiate. She's acknowledging the product's value to me, suggesting she's willing to bargain. I'll counter to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy."",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $8,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move closer to her price point. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties, potentially making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Emphasis on a Win-Win:** I'm highlighting that this price benefits both of us, encouraging her to accept."
