"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",13000.0,Bob,4,
