"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $2000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500.  That's still a good deal for you, considering what you're willing to sell it for.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $1000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $10250.  This is a fair price, considering your value and my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10250 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10800 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere.  However, I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $200. I'm counteroffering at $10700. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10700.0,Alice,7,
