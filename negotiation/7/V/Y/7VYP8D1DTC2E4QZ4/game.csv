"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering both our positions.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to accept $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
