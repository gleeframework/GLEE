"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to get the product for $8,000 or less, and Alice's offer is above that.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. You're still trying to get the product for $8,000 or less. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering both our positions."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to accept $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice is getting closer to your target price, you've already gone through several rounds and it seems she's not willing to go any lower. At this point, you've reached a point where John's offer is the better option.  You're saving $250 compared to Alice's offer, and you have a guaranteed deal with John."
