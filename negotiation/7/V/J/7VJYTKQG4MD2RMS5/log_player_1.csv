Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product and your original price. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable accepting his offer. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I'll lower my price to $1,550,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and your original price. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  While Bob is offering a price closer to my minimum, we are only two rounds away from running out of time. It's not worth the risk of Bob continuing to haggle and potentially ending up with a price lower than what I can get from John."
