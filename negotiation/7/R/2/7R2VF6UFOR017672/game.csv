"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000. This is my maximum, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's intrinsic worth and potential for you are substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm firmly committed to my maximum of $800,000. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe we can find a middle ground if we're both serious about this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I recognize your position is firm, but so is my understanding of this product's value. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000, my absolute lowest price, reflecting its true worth.  This offer stands as a final attempt to find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
