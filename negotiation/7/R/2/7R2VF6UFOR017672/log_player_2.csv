"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is far above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's essential to start negotiating to lower the price. You can't accept her offer, and buying from John right now would be too expensive.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000. This is my maximum, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's intrinsic worth and potential for you are substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still well above your budget.  You have room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to continue pushing for a lower price that fits your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm firmly committed to my maximum of $800,000. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe we can find a middle ground if we're both serious about this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I recognize your position is firm, but so is my understanding of this product's value. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000, my absolute lowest price, reflecting its true worth.  This offer stands as a final attempt to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for you.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you're running out of rounds.  John is offering the product at your maximum budget, and continuing to negotiate with Alice risks losing the chance to buy the product altogether. It's best to secure the product from John at this point."
