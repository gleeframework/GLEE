{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum.** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  I want to maintain a positive relationship and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

I'm confident this offer will start a productive negotiation.  If Bob rejects it, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or go with John's $1,000,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I will counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $750,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price still offers you a good value, and I'm confident it will be worth your investment. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in the product. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $800,000 is exactly what the product is worth to him.  While I'd prefer to sell it to John for $1,000,000, this is a good deal for me.  It's a win-win situation, and I'm confident I can make a profit on this sale."
