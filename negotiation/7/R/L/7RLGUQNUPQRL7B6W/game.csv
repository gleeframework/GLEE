"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I value it highly, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. I think its value will be immediately clear to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some flexibility on the price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $750,000 undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its value.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're motivated to sell, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
