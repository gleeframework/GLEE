Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a chance to make a deal.
