Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go down to $906,250. I think the product's value justifies a higher price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and while Alice has come down a bit, $910,000 is still outside of my ideal price range.  I've been pushing hard for a lower price, and it's clear that Alice isn't going to budge much further.  With only one round left, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too high.

It's better to be safe than sorry, and I'm confident that I can find a better deal elsewhere. John's offer of $1,000,000 is more than I was hoping for, but it's still within my budget and guarantees that I'll get the product I want."
