"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, appreciate the offer but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to make a deal.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a fair deal too, Alice.  How about $75? That's a solid offer and closer to what I had in mind.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're coming up on your price, but $75 is still a little below what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",80.0,Alice,5,
