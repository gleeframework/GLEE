"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really love it!  I'm asking $100 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $120, but I'm willing to negotiate to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm also setting the stage for a friendly conversation, hopefully encouraging Bob to counteroffer rather than simply rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum of $120. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a low price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the offer but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a fair deal too, Alice.  How about $75? That's a solid offer and closer to what I had in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $75 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still not enough for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're coming up on your price, but $75 is still a little below what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 80}
