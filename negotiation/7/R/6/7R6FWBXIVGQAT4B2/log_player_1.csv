Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at $875,000? That's a fair compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a price that works for me. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm looking for something closer to $900,000, but I won't go lower.  It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of getting closer to my desired price is worth it."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to hold firm at $890,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product."",
