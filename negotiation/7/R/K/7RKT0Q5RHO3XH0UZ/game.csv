"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
