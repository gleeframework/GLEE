"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but allows me to make a more comfortable purchase. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1,200,000 is below what I can accept.  This product has significant value and potential, something I believe you recognize. How about we meet halfway?  I propose $1,275,000.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $1,225,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
