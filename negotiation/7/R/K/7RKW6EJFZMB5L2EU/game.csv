"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a price you'll find worthwhile. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm going to have to make a slightly firmer offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I think that's a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product and the market price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $9,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
