"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $13,000?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my desired selling point.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Alice is likely to stick to her offer:** She's already moved from $14,000 to $13,500, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Further negotiation might not yield much more savings:** Bob might be able to get a few hundred dollars less, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal or going through more rounds of negotiation. 

Therefore, accepting the offer at $13,500 is the best option for Bob, balancing saving money with getting the product."
