"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $8800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9300. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",9300.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice! However, $9300 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $9000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9250. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
