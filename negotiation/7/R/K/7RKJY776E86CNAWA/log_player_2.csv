"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is offering the product at her own value, leaving no room for you to save money. Since you can buy the product for the same price from John, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better deal elsewhere."
