{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,000 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $8,400. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is now asking for $8,400, and Bob is only willing to go up to $8,000.  They are $400 apart.  John is offering a price that Bob is willing to pay, so there is no reason to keep negotiating with Alice."
