"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own this incredible item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,000 right now.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $8,400. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise.",8400.0,Alice,5,
