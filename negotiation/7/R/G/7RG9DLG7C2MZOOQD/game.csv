,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to get a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $850,000 is still below my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I can move on to another buyer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
