"Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree this product has potential,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is closer but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000. How about $1,550,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can sell the product to you for $1,580,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let's finalize the deal!",1580000.0,Alice,5,
