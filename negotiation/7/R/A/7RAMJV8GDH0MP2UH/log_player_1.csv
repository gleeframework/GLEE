Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still maintaining a good margin.  This should incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price while ensuring I still get a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, $1,050,000 is a very good deal considering the potential of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and leaving me with the option of only selling to John for $800,000.  It's time to close the deal."
