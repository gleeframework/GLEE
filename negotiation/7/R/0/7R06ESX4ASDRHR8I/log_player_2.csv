# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $870,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's desired price:** At $870,000, Alice's offer is only $10,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $860,000.
* **Further negotiation might be unproductive:**  It's likely Alice won't budge much further, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate.
* **Better than John's offer:**  $870,000 is significantly cheaper than John's price of $1,000,000.

**Conclusion:** It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product for a price he's comfortable with, while saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
