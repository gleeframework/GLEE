"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price that would benefit both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $860,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that would allow us to both close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $870,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",870000.0,Alice,5,
