"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll love. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $135.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is selling it for $135. This means you'd save $15 compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's offer is acceptable:**  While Alice might be willing to sell for less, you don't have enough information to know if you can get a better deal by rejecting."
