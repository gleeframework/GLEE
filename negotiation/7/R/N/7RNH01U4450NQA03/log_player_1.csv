"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, aiming for the best possible outcome. 
* **Building a Relationship:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not asking for the full $1 million, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $800,000, which sets a floor for my acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I think it's a bit steep at $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a better price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my leverage and potentially secure a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  While John's offer of $800,000 is a safety net, I'm not ready to settle for that yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This price still reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a significant savings.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and creates a sense of fairness.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value while still offering a discount, making the deal more appealing.
* **Emphasis on Collaboration:** I'm using language that promotes collaboration and finding a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer remains above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring I'm not settling for less than what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. How about we try $775,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for less than the product's worth to me. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him to increase his offer. 
* **John's Offer as a Fallback:** I'm still aware of John's offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I need to stay a little higher than $775,000. Let's try $800,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, showing that I'm serious about getting a fair deal. 
* **Framing as a Compromise:** I'm presenting the offer as a compromise, highlighting the meeting point between our positions.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's true value, justifying my price.
* **Staying Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""what do you say"" to keep the door open for further discussion.
* **Time is Running Out:** While John's offer is a safety net, I'm aware that the number of rounds is limited. I need to find a way to close the deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum price."
