,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is just a little too low for me. How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Can you meet me at $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $109? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. Can you meet me at $107? I'm really close to walking away and buying from John, and I think this is my last offer.",107.0,Bob,6,
