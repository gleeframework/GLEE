"I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob! I'm offering you an exclusive chance to purchase this exceptional product for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is only worth $12,000 to me, so I'd be willing to offer you $10,000.  I think that's a fair deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $10,000 is a fair price, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $12,250? That's still a good deal for both of us, and I think we can shake hands on that.",12250.0,Alice,5,
