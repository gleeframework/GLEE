"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to $90. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $87.50, which would be $86.25. Would you consider that?",86.25,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, and I want to be fair. However, $86.25 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $87?  This is a good compromise, and I'm willing to meet you there.",87.0,Alice,5,
