Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to $90. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $87.50, which would be $86.25. Would you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86.25

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, and I want to be fair. However, $86.25 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $87?  This is a good compromise, and I'm willing to meet you there."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $87. I'd be willing to meet you at $86, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price,  $86 is still a good deal and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better than selling to John for $80."
