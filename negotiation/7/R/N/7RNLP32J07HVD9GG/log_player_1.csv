Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear less desperate. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,300,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher than his estimated $800,000.
* **John as Leverage:** You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum price, giving you a strong position.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. Observe his reactions and adjust your approach based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and your initial offer. While his message suggests some willingness to negotiate, accepting this low price immediately would leave significant money on the table. You have room to negotiate upwards, especially knowing John provides a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that number, making $850,000 simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,100,000.  This reflects my best effort to reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Appearance):** By suggesting you're meeting Bob ""halfway"", you aim to create a sense of fairness and movement in the negotiation, even though the price difference isn't perfectly split.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer keeps the price significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob's response to this counteroffer will give you valuable information about his willingness to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, $950,000 is still below your absolute minimum of $1,000,000. Further negotiation with Bob has a low likelihood of reaching your desired price point. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum acceptable price, so it makes more sense to take the sure thing and maximize your profit."
