"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get out of the sale.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close. I can appreciate you working with me on the price. I'd be willing to settle at $780,000.  This offer would let me avoid further negotiations and get the product quickly.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to settle at $780,000. I can see that you're getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to get a good deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,7,
