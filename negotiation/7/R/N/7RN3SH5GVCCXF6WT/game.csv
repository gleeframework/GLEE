"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's above your value and a significant savings for me.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $12,500. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. How about $13,000 for the product? This still allows for a good profit margin while offering you a significant discount compared to my initial offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,
