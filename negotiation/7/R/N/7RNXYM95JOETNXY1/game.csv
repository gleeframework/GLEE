"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about we consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand you see the value in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
