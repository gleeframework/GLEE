"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $175?  It's still a great deal for a product like this.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $175 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $145?  Let's close this deal and get you the product you want.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm prepared to pay $130.  This is my final offer.  Let's make a deal.",130.0,Bob,6,
