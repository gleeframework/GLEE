"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $175?  It's still a great deal for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $175 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating. I'm hoping to get closer to my $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $175 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $145?  Let's close this deal and get you the product you want. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $145 is getting closer to my target, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  I'm hoping to get Alice down to $120 or close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm prepared to pay $130.  This is my final offer.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
