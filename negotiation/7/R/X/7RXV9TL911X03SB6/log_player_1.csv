Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still gives me some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum, and it's getting closer to my initial asking price. I think continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly higher price. Therefore, I'll accept his offer."
