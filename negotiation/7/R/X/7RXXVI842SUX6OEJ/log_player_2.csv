Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and I'm comfortable with $675,000. I'm getting a good deal, and it's better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  It's also a good point to close the deal as we are in the middle of the negotiation rounds."
