"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $14,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $15,500. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
