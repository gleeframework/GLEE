"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that I'm confident you'll realize. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $1,025,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,025,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I could consider $1,075,000, but that's my best offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,050,000 is too low, but $1,062,500 is more reasonable?",1062500.0,Bob,6,
