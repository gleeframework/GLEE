"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really love!  I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

You can get the product from John for $120, which is less than Alice's offer of $135. So it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
