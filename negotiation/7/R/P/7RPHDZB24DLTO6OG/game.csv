"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still gives you a significant saving compared to the product's true value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10750, as a final concession. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",10750.0,Alice,5,
