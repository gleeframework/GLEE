"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
