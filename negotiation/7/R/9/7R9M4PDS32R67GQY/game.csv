"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1800000 is significantly over my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1200000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value of the product, I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1600000 for it. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1600000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1400000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I'm not budging below that. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hesitant to go above my initial offer. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to increase my bid to $1300000. This is a good compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1300000, which is $1450000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This is a good compromise that allows us to close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $1400000, Bob. I think we've been close enough. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1550000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,9,
