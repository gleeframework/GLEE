"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm looking for $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting, $950,000 is still over his budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $850,000. I'm offering $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice is also showing flexibility.  It's likely that with a bit more back and forth they can find a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering $887,500 for the product. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finally find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's been trying to get the price down to $800,000, but at $887,500, he's only $87,500 over his budget. This is a reasonable compromise, and it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal to another buyer, or having to settle with John at $800,000."
