{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your target price of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $850,000, which is significantly lower than her initial offer but still a bit higher than my target price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing her that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my target price of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $875,000, which is a compromise between my target price and her last offer. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my target price, but it's still above it.  At this point, further negotiation might not yield a better price, and continuing could risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at a guaranteed $800,000.  It's time to secure the product and avoid further risk."
