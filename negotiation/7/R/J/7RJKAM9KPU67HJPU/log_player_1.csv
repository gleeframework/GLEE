Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a strong offer ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  This phrasing adds a sense of desirability and might make Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, you can always negotiate down towards your minimum price of $10,000."
