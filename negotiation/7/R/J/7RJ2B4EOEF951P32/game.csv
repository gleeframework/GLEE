"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still leaves some room for me to make a profit. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed it and I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
