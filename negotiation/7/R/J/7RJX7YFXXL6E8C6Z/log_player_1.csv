"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $1,050,000? That's a significant discount from my initial price and gives you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being somewhat flexible.  This offer is a compromise, and I hope it will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and try to bridge the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is my minimum, so I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to making a decision, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, and we're running out of time.  I'm willing to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
