"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but  $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, while also being a good value for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000. Would you be open to that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is the minimum price I need to make a deal worthwhile for me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
