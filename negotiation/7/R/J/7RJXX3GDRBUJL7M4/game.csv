"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I assure you it's worth no less than $1200000 to me. I'm willing to let it go for a price that benefits both of us. I believe the product's potential is immense, and I'm confident you'll see the same. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the significant value I see in the product, but it also allows for a substantial gain for you if it meets your needs. Please let me know your decision.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
