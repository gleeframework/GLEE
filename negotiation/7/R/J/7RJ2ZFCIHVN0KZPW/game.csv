"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more to work with.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",102.5,Bob,4,
