Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,000,000 or more in the right hands. I'm willing to make this deal happen for $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Bob is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price, but you can potentially get more.  
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, aiming to justify a higher price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with a price higher than $1,000,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. You have a cushion to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), the potential reward of a higher sale price to Bob might outweigh this risk."
