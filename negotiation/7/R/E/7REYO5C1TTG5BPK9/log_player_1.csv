Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a unique item that I believe you'll find great value in. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Potential for Higher Gain:** There's a chance Bob might value the product more than $10,000 or is willing to pay a premium for immediate availability.  

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., his negotiation style, how much he needs the product) and your risk tolerance, you might choose a different starting price."
