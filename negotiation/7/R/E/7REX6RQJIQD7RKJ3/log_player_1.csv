Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Strong but Polite Language:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob and inviting discussion.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the backup offer from John."
