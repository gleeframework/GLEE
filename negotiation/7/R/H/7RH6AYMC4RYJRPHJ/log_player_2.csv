Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and you're still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $130 to break even. How about we meet at $115?

It's clear Alice is not going to budge much further.  She's now claiming she needs $130 to break even (which contradicts her earlier statement about meeting halfway). It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal with John for $100."
