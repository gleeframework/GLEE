"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me and my business.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1600000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm prepared to come down slightly, and I'm offering you the product for $1650000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1625000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
