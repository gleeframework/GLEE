"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $140 is still above his maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $125?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $132.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $132.50 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better price, potentially closer to his $120 limit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to buy the product now if you accept."", ""product_price"": 130}
