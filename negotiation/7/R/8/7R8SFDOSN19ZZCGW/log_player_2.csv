"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This gives you a significant savings over what it's worth to you, and still allows me to get a good price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
