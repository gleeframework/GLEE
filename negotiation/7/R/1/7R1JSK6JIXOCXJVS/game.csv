"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good price, but $975,000 is still not enough for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm offering $987,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",987500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to reach a good deal, and I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to meet your needs while still getting a reasonable price for my product.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I will be selling to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can still come to an agreement.",985000.0,Bob,10,
