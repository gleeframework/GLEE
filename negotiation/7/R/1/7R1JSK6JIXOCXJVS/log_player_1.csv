Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 10
Bob's offer:

If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can still come to an agreement.

```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, but it's still not enough. With John willing to pay $800,000, I'm guaranteed a decent profit. The risk of Bob backing out and going with another seller is too high at this point."
