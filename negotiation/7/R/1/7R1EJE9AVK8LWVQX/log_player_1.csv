Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that Bob values the product higher than you do, but not by a huge margin. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's only $50,000 above my minimum price, which isn't worth the risk of losing out on a better offer. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below what I'd ideally like, but it's close enough to my minimum price that it's not worth risking further negotiation.  It's also only $25,000 less than my last counteroffer, which suggests he might be willing to budge a little more.  I'd rather secure a sale now than risk losing the deal completely."
