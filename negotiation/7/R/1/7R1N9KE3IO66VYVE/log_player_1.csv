Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I have 9 more rounds to work with and John is a solid backup option if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,110,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're able to offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I have 6 rounds left and John is a reliable backup if needed."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. However, $1,110,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,115,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1115000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,110,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price given the value it holds for me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting repetitive. Bob's counteroffer is essentially the same as his previous one, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer from him.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I have a guaranteed deal with John that's only $90,000 less. With only four rounds left, it's not worth risking losing out on a sure thing."
