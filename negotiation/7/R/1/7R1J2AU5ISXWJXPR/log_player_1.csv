Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes potential profit. However, starting too high could make Bob reject the offer outright. 
* **Chosen Price:** $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
