"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident that this product is worth at least $800000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a chance to acquire a game-changing asset at a price that could offer significant upside. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
