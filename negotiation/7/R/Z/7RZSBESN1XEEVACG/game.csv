,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $92. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $88?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $90. It's a good price, and I think you'll really like the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
