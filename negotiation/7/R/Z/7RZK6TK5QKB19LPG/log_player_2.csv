"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is valued at over $1 million to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm offering it for $1000000.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your ideal price range. You want to save as much money as possible and explore if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to both of us, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  You're opening with a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This creates room for negotiation and shows your willingness to compromise.
* **Value Focus:** You emphasize the value the product holds for both of you, reminding Alice of the potential gain she still has.
* **Bridge the Gap:** You're using positive language, suggesting a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings to you.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm aiming for.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above what you're hoping to pay. There's still room to negotiate, and you want to see if you can get even closer to your target price.  You're also mindful of your remaining negotiation rounds, as buying from John is still a possibility if you don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that's mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continue Compromise:**  You acknowledge Alice's compromise but reiterate your desire for a lower price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** You emphasize ""fairness"" to make it clear that you're not just trying to lowball her.
* **Mutual Benefit:** You re-state the desire for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Slightly Increased Offer:** This shows a willingness to move closer to her position but still leaves room for more negotiation."
