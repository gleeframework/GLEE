"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. It's still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can find common ground.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $140 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $130. If you're not willing to go higher, I'm going to have to consider other options.",130.0,Alice,7,
