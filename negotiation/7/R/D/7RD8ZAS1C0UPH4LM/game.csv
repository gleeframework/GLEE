"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.",925000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $925,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $700,000. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This adjusted price reflects the product's true worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find middle ground here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, the $760,000 offer is still too far from what I consider fair. I'm open to moving slightly closer, how about we settle at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $790,000.  That reflects a serious commitment on my part.",790000.0,Bob,6,
