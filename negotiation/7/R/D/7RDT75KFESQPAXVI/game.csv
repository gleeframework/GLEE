"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $140. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $152.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the value this product offers. What do you think?",152.5,Alice,5,
