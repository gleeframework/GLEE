Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $150. This is our baseline.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly above Bob's perceived value leaves room for potential negotiation. He might counter-offer, but we're still likely to land a price higher than our minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't go below $150. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a fair deal."
