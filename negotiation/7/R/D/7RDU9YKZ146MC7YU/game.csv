"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, $8000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9000,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $8500? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9500.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,6,
