Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and quality. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum value. The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value. While it's tempting to accept the $10,000, it's better to try and negotiate further. You can potentially secure a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below your minimum value of $12,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $12,000 and ensure you meet your minimum.  While further negotiation is possible, it's uncertain if you'll be able to get a higher price from Bob, and the risk of a lower price or prolonged negotiation outweighs the potential gain."
