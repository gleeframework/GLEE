"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,3,
