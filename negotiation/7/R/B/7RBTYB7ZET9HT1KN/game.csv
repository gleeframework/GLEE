"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential savings you'll gain.
