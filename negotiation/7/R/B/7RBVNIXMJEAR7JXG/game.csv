"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the product's potential, the price point is significantly higher than I had in mind.  I'd be interested in continuing the conversation if you're open to negotiating. How about we consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,700,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation while still acknowledging the product's unique benefits. Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget.  To be completely transparent, I'm working with a maximum of $800,000.  If we can find a price closer to that range, I'm confident we can strike a deal. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm willing to be flexible, but to make this work for both of us, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. That last offer was closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a strong offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you stretching your budget.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
