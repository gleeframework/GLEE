Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified without explicitly stating why Bob should pay more than its worth to him.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying you have other options like John), you create a subtle sense of urgency and competition for Bob.

This strategy aims to give you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
