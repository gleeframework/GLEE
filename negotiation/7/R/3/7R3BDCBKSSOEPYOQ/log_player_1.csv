Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,700,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you.  I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm aiming for a price slightly higher than John's offer. This gives Bob a good deal but still allows me to maximize my profits.
* **Message:** I emphasize the value to Bob, while also suggesting a sense of urgency and exclusivity. 

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy balances risk and reward. 

* **Risk:** There's a chance Bob rejects the offer. However, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. 
* **Reward:** If Bob accepts, I earn more than I would from John. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
