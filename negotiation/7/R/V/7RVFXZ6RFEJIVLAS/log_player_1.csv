I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit.  This price is significantly higher than my minimum value, and I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm also keeping in mind the alternative offer from John for $1,200,000, which sets my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value. I believe this price is fair and likely to be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now just slightly below my initial counteroffer of $1,600,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm comfortable accepting this offer. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
