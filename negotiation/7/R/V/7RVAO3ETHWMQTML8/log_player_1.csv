Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below your minimum ($120).** This leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible.** By offering a price lower than your minimum, you show you're open to discussion.
* **It includes a friendly message.** Building rapport can make Bob more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $120.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can offer a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Explore other options:**  If the negotiation stalls, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $85 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $95?  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible while still staying close to my desired price point.
* **Fairness:**  $95 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, highlighting a potential compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the benefits of the deal for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired range, and I'm worried the negotiation will drag on further. 

Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $120, which is significantly more than what I can get from Bob.  It's also faster and avoids further negotiation."
