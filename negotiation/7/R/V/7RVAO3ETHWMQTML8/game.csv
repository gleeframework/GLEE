"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $85 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $95?  This would give us both a fair deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
