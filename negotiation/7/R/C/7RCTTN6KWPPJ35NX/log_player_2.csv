"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, it's still more than what Bob values the product at ($120). There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $108. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $108 is closer to his value of the product, there's still some room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob a chance to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $108 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and I pay $106?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $107. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $107 is still within Bob's budget of $120, and significantly lower than what John is offering ($120).
* **Negotiation:**  Alice has already indicated that $107 is her lowest price. Pushing further risks the deal and might lead to a higher price or the loss of the product.
* **Time:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer guarantees a purchase within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential deals in future rounds."
