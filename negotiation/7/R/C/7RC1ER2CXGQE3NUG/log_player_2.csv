"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's offer is at your limit, there is no benefit to negotiating further.  You're guaranteed to get the product for the same price from John, so it's best to go with the sure thing."
