"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's worth that much to you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice makes a case that the product is worth $1,000,000 to both of you, there's no room for negotiation in her offer.  You can do just as well buying from John without even having to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice might make a better offer if you reject this one."
