"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is within my budget and a good deal considering my goal is to save as much money as possible.  Accepting this offer is the best option in this round."
