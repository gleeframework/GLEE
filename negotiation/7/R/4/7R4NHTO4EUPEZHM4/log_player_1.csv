Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $11,500, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $10,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $11,500. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I think I can push for a better price."
