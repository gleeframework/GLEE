"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay, but I'm willing to consider your offer. Let's make this transaction beneficial for both of us. How about we discuss a price that reflects its true value to you while ensuring it's a fair deal for me? Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than your maximum budget of $80 and the guaranteed price of $80 from John. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer closer to your range, or you can simply proceed to buy from John at the lower price."
