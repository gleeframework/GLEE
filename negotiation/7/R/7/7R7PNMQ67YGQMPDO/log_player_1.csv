Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a reasonable starting point that gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always keep in mind that John is willing to pay $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum price of $150, and I'd rather avoid the risk of further negotiation and a potential lower offer."
