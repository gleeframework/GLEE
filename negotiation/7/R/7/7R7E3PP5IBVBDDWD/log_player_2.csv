The offer is far too high, and it's worth trying to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum limit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$12,000 is still too high, and it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you at $9,000, which is closer to my maximum and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to go as low as $9000, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $11000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$11,000 is still a bit too high, and it's worth trying to negotiate further. We're getting closer to the desired price, and Alice seems willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal work. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me at $10000. However, I'm not willing to accept this price. I'll make one more counteroffer, and then I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to meet you at $11500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. Given that this is Alice's final offer and I have limited rounds left, it's best to secure the product from John for $8,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids risking further negotiation."
