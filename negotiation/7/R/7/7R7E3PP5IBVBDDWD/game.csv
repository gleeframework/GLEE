"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare find and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to let it go for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum limit.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you at $9000, which is closer to my maximum and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to go as low as $9000, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $11000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal work. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant compromise for me.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me at $10000. However, I'm not willing to accept this price. I'll make one more counteroffer, and then I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to meet you at $11500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can make a deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
