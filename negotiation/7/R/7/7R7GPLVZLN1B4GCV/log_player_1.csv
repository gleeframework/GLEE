"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial $20,000 asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob, but still allow me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $16,000 is a good compromise and allows me to make a profit."
