Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while I'd prefer to pay $1,000,000, the difference of $50,000 isn't significant enough to risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure the product at a good price than to hold out for an ideal price and potentially miss out."
