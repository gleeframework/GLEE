"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high to see if Bob is willing to pay more than the product is worth to him. I'm also leaving some room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to that price.  I'm also confident that I can get a better offer from Bob or sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $175.  This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better offer from Bob or sell to John for a higher price. I'm not giving up on the negotiation just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $160. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. If he rejects this offer, I might start considering selling to John, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is finally above my minimum value of $150.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of him rejecting further offers or me needing to sell to John."
