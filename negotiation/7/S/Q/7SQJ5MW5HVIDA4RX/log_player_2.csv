"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me, but I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
