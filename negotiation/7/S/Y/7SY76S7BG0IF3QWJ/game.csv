"While I appreciate the offer, $1500000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would like to propose a price of $1000000.  This aligns with my maximum purchasing power and allows for potential negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product and willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, while also being more in line with your budget. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
