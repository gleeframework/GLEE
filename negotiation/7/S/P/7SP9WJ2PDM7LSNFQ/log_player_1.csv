Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its unique value, I believe a starting price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he can bring the price down.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,900,000, I'm setting a high anchor point.  Even if this price is rejected, it makes it psychologically harder for Bob to counter with an offer significantly lower. 
* **Knowing My Worth:** I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I have a backup buyer. This allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,900,000 price leaves plenty of room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  I started high, and he countered with a significant jump down. This indicates he's likely willing to go higher than $1,500,000. I'll counter to see if I can secure a better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,500,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. Could we agree on $1,700,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer aims to meet closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counter. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still striving for a higher price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to see the justification for the higher price.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not drastically dropping my price. I want to convey that I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $1,600,000 is a strong profit, exceeding my minimum by $100,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might net a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the sale to Bob increases.  He's consistently moving upward, but in smaller increments.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate ties up the sale and prevents me from pursuing other opportunities.  Accepting now secures the profit."
