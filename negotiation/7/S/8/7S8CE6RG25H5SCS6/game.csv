"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my limit. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $14000. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14000. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.
