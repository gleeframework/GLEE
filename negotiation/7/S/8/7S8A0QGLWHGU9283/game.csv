"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to come up to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
