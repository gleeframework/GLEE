"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible.
* **There are 10 rounds.** This gives you plenty of opportunity to negotiate a better price.
* **Rejecting allows you to set the pace.** You can control the negotiation by starting with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While her offer is lower than round 1, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible. 
* **There are still 7 rounds left.** You have plenty of time to keep negotiating. 
* **You can potentially get a better price.** By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can push Alice further down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to come up to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target.**  At $10,500, you're saving a significant amount compared to John's price.
* **There's a risk of going higher.** If you reject and make another counteroffer, there's a chance Alice will stick to her $10,500 price, and you could end up paying more.
* **Time is a factor.**  With 5 rounds remaining, you don't want to risk getting stuck with a worse deal later."
