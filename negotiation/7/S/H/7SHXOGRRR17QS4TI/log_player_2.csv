"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a one-time deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Your maximum:** You're willing to spend $120.
* **Alice's offer:** $110.
* **John's price:** $120.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your ideal price point. It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate further or find a better deal elsewhere."
