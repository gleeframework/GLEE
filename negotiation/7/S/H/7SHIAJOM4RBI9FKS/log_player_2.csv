"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer you $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected Alice's offer of $12,000, so he's definitely looking for something less.  At $11,500, he's saving $3,500 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, it's a good deal, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept another counteroffer."
