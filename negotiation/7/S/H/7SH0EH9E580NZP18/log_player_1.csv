{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $100 minimum, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's value:** The price is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price if needed, and it allows for Bob to make a counteroffer.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $100, it's still below the price you're hoping to achieve. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is the lowest I can go.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** You're not accepting his $105, but you're showing flexibility.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:**  You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're keeping your goal in mind. 

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is just a few dollars away from your initial target of $115, and it's definitely a better deal than selling to John for $100.  Accepting this offer will secure a sale that's close to your desired price point."
