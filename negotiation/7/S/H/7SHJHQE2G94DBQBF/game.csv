"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for you, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident it can generate much more for you in the long run.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. Your offer is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down further to $1,250,000. However, I need to be transparent - this is the lowest I can go.  I believe this price represents significant value for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but that's still a bit rich for me.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
