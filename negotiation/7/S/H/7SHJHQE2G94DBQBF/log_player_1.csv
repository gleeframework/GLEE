"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for you, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the product's value and using positive language, I aim to create a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the conversation and express his perspective. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting would mean a significant loss. It's clear there's room for negotiation, so I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident it can generate much more for you in the long run.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Countering:** I started by acknowledging Bob's offer but made it clear that it's too low.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's potential value to Bob to justify the higher price. 
* **Significant Drop:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial price to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum. 
* **Framing as Compromise:**  Positioning the new price as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to see it positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. Your offer is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $950,000 is still under my absolute minimum of $1,200,000. Bob incrementally increased his offer, indicating his interest. I'll counter-offer again to keep the negotiation moving, but I need to signal I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down further to $1,250,000. However, I need to be transparent - this is the lowest I can go.  I believe this price represents significant value for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Flexibility:**  I'm making another price drop to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. 
* **Setting a Limit:** This offer is only slightly above my absolute minimum, and I'm clearly stating this to Bob.  This adds weight to the offer and signals I'm nearing the end of my concessions. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this deal is good for both sides to encourage Bob to accept.  

This offer puts the pressure on Bob. He can either accept a price close to his perceived value or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but that's still a bit rich for me.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob Hit His Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated his absolute maximum price is $1,000,000. 
* **Below My Minimum:** This price is still below my absolute minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Upside Potential:** Even with further rounds of negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer.  

It's time to cut my losses.  I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price. It makes more sense to secure the deal with John than to continue negotiating with Bob for a lower return."
