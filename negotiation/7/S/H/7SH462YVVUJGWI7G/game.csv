"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me while still being a good deal for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
