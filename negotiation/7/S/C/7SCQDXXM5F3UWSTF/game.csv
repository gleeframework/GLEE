"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $170 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $170 and $140. How about we try $155?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $145? It's closer to my budget and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you halfway between $155 and $145. How about we try $150?",150.0,Alice,5,
