"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $110? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a big drop, Alice.  How about $100? That's the most I can justify spending on it.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we try $115? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
