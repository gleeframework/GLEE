"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget and the current market conditions, I am unable to meet the asking price of $22,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $14,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value you'll gain.",19000.0,Alice,3,
