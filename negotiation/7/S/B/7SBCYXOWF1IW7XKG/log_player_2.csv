# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at over $1.2 million to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1 million to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference - how about $1,025,000? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.
