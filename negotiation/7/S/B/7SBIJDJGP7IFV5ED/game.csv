"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm happy to negotiate, $900000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1000000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire this valuable product and me to ensure a worthwhile sale.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. Let's compromise at $975000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",975000.0,Alice,5,
