"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $85, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal for $105. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
