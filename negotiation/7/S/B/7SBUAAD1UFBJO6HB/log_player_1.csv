"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm open to offers, but it's worth at least $100 to me. How about we start with $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a friendly tone and encourages Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I value this product highly, $90 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $105? I'm confident you'll find it a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but $105 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we settle on $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  Since I can also sell to John for $100, I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation."
