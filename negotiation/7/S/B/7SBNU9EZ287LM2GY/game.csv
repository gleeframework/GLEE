"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, as I think it's a great deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make a decent profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $10,500. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about finding a middle ground.  Let's try $9,500. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm really not comfortable going above $9,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
