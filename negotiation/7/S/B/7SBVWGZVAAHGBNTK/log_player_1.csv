Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to Bob than it is to me. I believe this offer is attractive enough to encourage Bob to negotiate further, but not so high that I'm leaving too much money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal selling point.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. By meeting him halfway, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I believe I can still secure a price closer to $11,000 by being persistent in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $10,500. This is a further compromise, but it's still above his last offer and closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping that by being persistent and showing a willingness to negotiate, I can reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to accept it. I've been through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob is not going to budge much more.  I'm worried that if I continue to counteroffer, Bob might walk away entirely. To avoid losing the sale and getting only $8,000 from John, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $8,000."
