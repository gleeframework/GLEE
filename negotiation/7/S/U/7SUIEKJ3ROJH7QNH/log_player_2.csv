"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum price ($1,500,000). You have a better alternative by buying from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, and it's unlikely she'll accept it immediately. However, it establishes a starting point for negotiation and forces Alice to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, it's still above my maximum price of $1,500,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there is still room for a price that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is a more realistic price point than my previous offer, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating. I'm still below my maximum price, and I believe there's a good chance Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price further, it's still slightly above my maximum price of $1,500,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice as there's still a chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price, but I'm getting closer to my limit and may need to consider buying from John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer before I consider buying from John.  It's a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still within my maximum price range. I believe this offer shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go over my budget.  If Alice rejects this offer, I will buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still above my maximum price of $1,500,000.  I've already made my final offer, and it was rejected.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I will buy from John."
