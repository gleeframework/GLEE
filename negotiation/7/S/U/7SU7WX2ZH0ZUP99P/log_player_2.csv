"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal at a price of $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice's product is worth $80 to her, so there's a potential for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $110
* **Bob's Maximum:** $150
* **Alice's Minimum:** $80

While Bob could potentially negotiate further, $110 is a good compromise that saves him $40 compared to John's price. It also ensures a profit for Alice.  Accepting the offer is the best strategy in this situation."
