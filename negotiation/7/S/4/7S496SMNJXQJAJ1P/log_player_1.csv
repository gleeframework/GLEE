"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, I can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $125.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm running the risk of losing the sale.  $125 is a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
