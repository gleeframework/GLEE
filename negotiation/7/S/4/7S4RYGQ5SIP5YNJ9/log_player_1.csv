Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
