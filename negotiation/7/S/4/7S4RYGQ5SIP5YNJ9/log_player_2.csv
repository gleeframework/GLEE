"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

The product is worth more to Alice than to you.  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've put into the product and the potential benefits it can bring to you. I hope you'll consider this offer and let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While you could potentially get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice walking away and you having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  $900,000 is a good price within your budget, and it's likely that Alice won't budge much further."
