"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $1,325,000 is too high for me. I would like to propose a price of $1,275,000. I hope this aligns better with our negotiations.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $1,275,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
