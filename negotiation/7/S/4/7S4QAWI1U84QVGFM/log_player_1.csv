}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting at $1,295,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Strong Profit:** This price still yields a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly moving closer to my desired range, and this acceptance shows I'm willing to meet him partway.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out longer risks Bob losing interest or me missing other opportunities. A deal now is better than the uncertainty of a higher offer later."
