"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* However, you know you have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. She might be willing to come down closer to her $1,200,000 valuation. 

**It's important to note:** This strategy involves some risk.  Alice might not be willing to negotiate further, and you'd have to buy from John at the higher price."
