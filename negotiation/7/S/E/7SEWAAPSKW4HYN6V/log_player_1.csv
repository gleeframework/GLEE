Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  You only get one chance with Bob. If he declines, you go with your backup offer.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but be realistic. You want to maximize your profit, but an overly aggressive offer might scare Bob away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You're positioning the product as valuable and desirable.
* **Strong Price:** $1,400,000 secures a $200,000 profit for you (well above your minimum) and leaves Bob with a $100,000 gain compared to his valuation. 
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other interested parties"" add a touch of pressure without being overly aggressive.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a two-way street. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to consider his proposal and potentially adjust your price slightly if it makes sense for you to secure the deal."
