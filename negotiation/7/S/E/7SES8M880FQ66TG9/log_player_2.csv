"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, but also wants to be realistic. Offering $950,000 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer, and it's within the range where Alice might still find it profitable to sell. It's a good starting point for further negotiation, and allows room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. By rejecting and countering, Bob can continue to push for a lower price.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell, so there's a good chance she might be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is a compromise that shows good faith, but is still a significant saving compared to Alice's latest offer and buying from John. This encourages Alice to consider closing the deal without needing to go back and forth further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is now closer to Bob's desired price point.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection is higher.  Additionally, if Alice rejects again, her counteroffer might be even higher, pushing Bob closer to John's price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's significantly better than John's and still within a reasonable range for both parties."
