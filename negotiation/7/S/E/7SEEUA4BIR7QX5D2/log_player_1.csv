Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. While my asking price is $1,150,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that might be agreeable to both of us.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, Alice should aim to get more from Bob.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can potentially still secure a price higher than $1,200,000. 
* **Friendly and Open Tone:** The message is framed positively, encouraging Bob to engage in a discussion and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
