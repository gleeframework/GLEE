Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with $1,400,000. This is a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. I emphasize the value of the product to both of us. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to get a quick deal while still maximizing my profits. 

* **Start high:**  By starting with a higher price, I set the tone for the negotiation and aim to secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The $1,400,000 price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm giving too much away. 
* **Alternative buyer:**  The existence of John, willing to pay my minimum, ensures I won't be pressured to accept an offer that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's closer than his initial valuation, it's not enough to make me sell. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob in the hopes of securing a better price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer, aiming to meet Bob somewhere in the middle while still staying above my minimum. 
* **John as leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
