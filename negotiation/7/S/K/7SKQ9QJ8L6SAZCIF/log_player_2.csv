You can do better than $1,400,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  This would give us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

``` 

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a good deal, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  However, it's getting close to my maximum, and it's possible Alice will not go lower.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
