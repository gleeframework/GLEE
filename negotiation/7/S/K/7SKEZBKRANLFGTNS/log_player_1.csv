I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident that this price is attractive enough to Bob, given that the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $12,000. While it's higher than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it still gives me a good profit. I believe it's a fair price that Bob is likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting too low for me. I'd rather sell to John for $10,000 than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
