Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Is below your minimum:** $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, allowing for potential profit.
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** The message is friendly and open to discussion.

It's important to remember that the goal is to maximize profit while also considering the potential for a deal to fall through.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum, it's still below our desired profit margin. Selling to John for $10,000 is the more lucrative option. However, we can still try to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, we signal that we're not willing to settle for his price and encourage him to come back with a more reasonable offer.  We'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This offer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's offer while still leaving some room for profit.  $9,000 is a fair midpoint between our last offer and Bob's current offer. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and acknowledges Bob's offer while clearly stating our counterproposal. It also highlights the value of the product, encouraging Bob to see the benefits of a deal at this price.

This counteroffer maintains a balanced approach. We're not giving away too much, but we're also showing flexibility and a willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000, which would be $8,750. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer to our minimum, but it's still not enough.  We've already compromised twice, and continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions and ultimately a lower profit.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees our desired profit margin and avoids further time-consuming negotiations."
