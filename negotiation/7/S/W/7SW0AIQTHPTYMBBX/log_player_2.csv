"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's negotiate with Alice a bit. $120 is better than John's price, but we can try to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to bring the price down significantly closer to our target and John's offer.  It's a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll really appreciate it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at our ideal price point. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price, and we both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counteroffer aims to settle at our target price. It's a strong position as Alice is incentivized to sell at a higher price than John offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $15. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems unlikely Alice will come down to $100.  While she's offering a better price than her initial offer, it makes more sense to cut our losses and go with John's guaranteed $100 price."
