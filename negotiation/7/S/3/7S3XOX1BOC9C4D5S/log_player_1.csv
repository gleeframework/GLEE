Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you wanting to share the value, but $110 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which would still be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to find a middle ground.
