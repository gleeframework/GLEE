"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's best to counter-offer and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's opening offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with. It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

We're splitting the difference again with this counter-offer. It shows Alice we are willing to negotiate towards a middle ground, but we are also holding firm on getting a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice seems to be anchored on that $13,000 mark.  While this latest offer is closer, it's still too high. I'm willing to push this a little further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you have a bottom line, Alice, and I respect that.  How about we try $12,000? That's a strong offer, and I think it would be beneficial for both of us to close the deal now."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

This offer represents a significant concession on my part. I'm moving closer to Alice's original asking price, but it's still below my maximum budget. This puts the ball in Alice's court and might encourage her to accept a deal now rather than risk further negotiation."
