"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm aiming to stay within my $1,000,000 limit. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate!  I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about we split the difference again and go with $1,000,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to purchase the product within my limit.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll make one more offer to try to find a compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
