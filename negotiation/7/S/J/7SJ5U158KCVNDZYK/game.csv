"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider it?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 still isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
