Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a very competitive price of $1,450,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its worth. Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you should aim for a price higher than that to maximize your profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, but that doesn't mean he won't pay more. There's room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Competitive Edge:**  By presenting the offer as ""competitive"" and ""fair,"" you create a positive tone that might make Bob more receptive.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of losing the deal and accepting John's offer, which is your fallback option."
