"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $950,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  Even though you value the product at $1,000,000, saving $50,000 is a good deal."
