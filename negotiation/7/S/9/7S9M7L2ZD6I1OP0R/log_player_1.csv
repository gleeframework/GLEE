{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I've chosen to offer the product at $1,200,000. This price is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while stating my price expectations. 

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:** Starting with a higher price gives me more leverage in the negotiation.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as backup:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation.

By taking this approach, I aim to achieve the best possible outcome: securing a sale close to my desired price while ensuring I don't miss out on a potentially lucrative deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to accept a price that is below what I value the product at.  

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to push for a higher price.
* **Maintain leverage:** I have the advantage of being able to sell to John for $1,000,000, which gives me more power in the negotiation.
* **Potential for compromise:** By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still seeking a price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $1,050,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the fairness of the offer. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Compromise and Value:** This counteroffer balances the need to compromise with the need to secure a price close to my desired value.
* **Showing Flexibility:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Pressuring Bob:**  By offering a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm subtly increasing the pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.

I believe this counteroffer positions me well for a successful negotiation, while still providing me with a solid fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product to you and the price you're willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product. At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $1,000,000 and secure a guaranteed profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Prioritizing Profit:**  My primary goal is to maximize profit, and selling to John for $1,000,000 achieves this.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of further price reductions, which could ultimately result in a lower selling price than John's offer.
* **Minimizing Time and Effort:** Selling to John eliminates the need for further negotiation, saving me time and effort.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm always open to negotiation, in this instance, selling to John presents the most financially advantageous and risk-free option."
