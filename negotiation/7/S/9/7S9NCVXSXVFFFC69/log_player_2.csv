"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's well below my minimum asking price. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still way above what the product is worth to Bob.  While it's below her minimum asking price, it's not a good deal for Bob. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant profit, and it's much closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,000,000 is still above Bob's target price. He's better off rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate.  There's still room for Alice to come down further, and he can always choose to buy from John if the negotiations stall."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000.

Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to achieve our desired outcomes. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now only $75,000 above Bob's target price. While he could potentially continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't come down much further, and there's a risk that she'll simply walk away from the deal. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's still a good deal for him."
