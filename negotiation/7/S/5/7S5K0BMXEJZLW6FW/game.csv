"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $7,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,500, which would be $7,750. Would you be willing to accept this price?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  $8,000 is my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
