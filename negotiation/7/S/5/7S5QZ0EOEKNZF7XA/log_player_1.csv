Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I cannot meet you at $17,500. My maximum budget is $10,000. Would you consider accepting this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to budge from his $10,000 offer. Accepting it would be a significant loss. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's time to move on to a more promising buyer."
