"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $90 is above Bob's maximum budget of $80. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within his budget. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential compromise.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $82. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $82 is still slightly above Bob's budget. Although it's closer to his maximum price, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to $80 or lower.  There are still rounds left, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my maximum price for this item.  Let me know if you're able to accept that."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob sticks to his maximum budget of $80, making it clear this is his final offer. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal. It's a firm but polite stance, aiming to secure the product at the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $81. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $81 is only $1 less than John's offer of $80.  It's not a significant enough discount for Bob to risk continuing the negotiation, especially since there are only 5 rounds remaining.  Given that Bob can get the product for his maximum budget from John, it's more sensible to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
