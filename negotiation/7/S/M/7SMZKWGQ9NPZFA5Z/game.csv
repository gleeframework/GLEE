"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is the maximum I can afford. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
