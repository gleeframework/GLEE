"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my asking price.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good return on your investment.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a significant discount from my original asking price. It gives you a fair price for the product while also ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value it holds for me, while also allowing you a good profit. Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a good compromise, given the value it holds for me. This offers you a fair return on your investment. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but $9,500 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a good deal. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but I'm still not able to meet that price. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. This offer provides you with a good return on your investment, and it's the best I can do. Let's make this deal happen.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,750 is still not enough. I'm willing to come down to $10,250, but this is my final offer.  I'm not comfortable going lower, and I'm ready to move on to other buyers if this deal doesn't work out. It's up to you to decide if this is a deal you want to make.",10250.0,Alice,9,
