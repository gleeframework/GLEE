Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
