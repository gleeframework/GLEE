While I cannot disclose specifics at this time, I assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a chance to acquire something truly exceptional. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget.  Since you know you can buy the product from John for the same price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting it opens the possibility of Alice lowering her price to make the deal more attractive to you."
