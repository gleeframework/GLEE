"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While there's potential for further negotiation, the risk of going back and forth with Alice is too high.  I'm better off going with John's offer and securing the product at my desired price."
