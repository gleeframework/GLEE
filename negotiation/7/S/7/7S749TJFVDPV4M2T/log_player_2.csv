"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a great deal! Alice's offer of $9,500 is well below your $10,000 maximum and saves you a significant amount of money. There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a better price, and it's not worth the risk of losing out on this offer."
