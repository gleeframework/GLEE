"I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a complimentary service package worth $50000. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000, but I'll also include this service package for free.

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000, which is the same price I offered in round 5, but without the service package. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not interested, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is my minimum price.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
