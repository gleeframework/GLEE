"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and save some money for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it will get us both closer to what we want.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
