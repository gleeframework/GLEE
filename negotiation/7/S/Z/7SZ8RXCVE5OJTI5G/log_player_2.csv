{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, so I need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's only a few hundred dollars away from his ideal price, and it's worth trying to get it."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $8,000.  Would you consider $8,200?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8200} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're pushing hard for a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $8,300, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's only $300 over his ideal price, and it's unlikely he'll get a better deal. Further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether, and he's running out of rounds."
