"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it for $2,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling price. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Consideration of Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, my starting price is significantly higher than his valuation. This leaves room for me to come down while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which acts as a strong fallback position and gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested in the product. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both his own valuation and my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage further. However, the new price remains well above both my minimum acceptable price and Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm eager to make a deal, I'm not desperate. My counteroffer still allows for significant negotiation room while keeping the price point in a range that is profitable for me.
* **Time Constraint in Mind:**  We are in Round 3 of 10. I need to make substantial progress towards a mutually agreeable price to avoid running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value is significant, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, But Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to an acceptable range, but it's still below my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Negotiating Leverage:** I still have the option to sell to John, giving me leverage to push for a better price from Bob.
* **Time Remaining:**  With 6 rounds left, there's room for further negotiation. I'm aiming to close the gap quickly in the upcoming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,700,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $200,000, a significant move designed to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a substantial increase in his offer. 
* **Midpoint Price:** This offer is closer to the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that time is a factor.  I need to guide Bob towards a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Reach Agreement:**  While Bob increased his offer, it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. Based on his negotiation patterns, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's acceptable to me within the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if I continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is an opportunity cost. By selling to John now, I can move forward with the certainty of a profitable deal."
