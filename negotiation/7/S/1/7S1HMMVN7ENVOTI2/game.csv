"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle on this.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $13,250, which is a fair midpoint between our last offers. This gives you a good deal and allows me to avoid selling to John for a slightly lower price.  Let's close this deal!",13250.0,Alice,5,
