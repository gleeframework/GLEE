"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It is still worthwhile to try and negotiate further with Alice. While buying from John would secure the product at your desired price, it might be possible to get Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $13,250, which is a fair midpoint between our last offers. This gives you a good deal and allows me to avoid selling to John for a slightly lower price.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that is within your budget, and you can likely get a better price from John if you reject the offer and go to him. Accepting the offer from Alice gives you a good deal and keeps the negotiation process moving forward."
