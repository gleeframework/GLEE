"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Saves you money:** $110 is cheaper than your maximum budget of $120 and cheaper than buying from John. 
* **Gets you the product:** You achieve your goal of buying the product."
