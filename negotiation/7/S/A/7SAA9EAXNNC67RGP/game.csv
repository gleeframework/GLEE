"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still firm on getting at least $16,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $15,500?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $15,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay.",15250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling generous!  How about we settle on $15,400?  It's just a small step from your last offer and brings us closer to a final agreement.  What do you say?",15400.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $15,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay.",15200.0,Bob,8,
