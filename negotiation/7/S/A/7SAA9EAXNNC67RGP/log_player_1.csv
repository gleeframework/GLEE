Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still firm on getting at least $16,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

While $14,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $15,500?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $15,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,250 is very close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can get $15,500 if I keep negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $15,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd like to get a bit more,  I've reached the point where the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the potential gain.  I'm happy with a guaranteed $15,000, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price."
