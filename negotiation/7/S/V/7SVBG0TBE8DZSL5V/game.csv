"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a great deal to you, given its value to your business. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price of $1,150,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a fantastic opportunity for you.  Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,050,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately a bit lower than I'm comfortable accepting right now. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This price still represents a great deal for you, considering the value you've outlined. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,075,000.  I believe this price point makes this a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
