**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above John's offer.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $1,200,000, especially with only 5 rounds remaining. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John to secure the product at the best price."
