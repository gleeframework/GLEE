Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. 

If Bob rejects this, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my desired price point.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial target.  

I'll counter with a price that's closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum.  

I hope Bob sees this as a fair compromise and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $920,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than what I'd get from John.  

At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the sale altogether, especially since he's already come down from his initial offer.  It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
