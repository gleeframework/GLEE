"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
