"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, you have no incentive to reject her offer. However, there's no benefit to accepting either. Buying from John guarantees you the product for the same price, so you might as well go with the certainty."
