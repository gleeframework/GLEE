It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what the product is worth to me. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."

I'm offering Alice $800,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and it's the same price I could get from John. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll go with John."
