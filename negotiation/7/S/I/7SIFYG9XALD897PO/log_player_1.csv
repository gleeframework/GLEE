Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer of $1,200,000 represents a good compromise:

* **For Alice:** It's significantly higher than the $800,000 she'd get from John, maximizing her profit.
* **For Bob:** It's significantly lower than the $1,500,000 he values the product at, meaning a substantial savings for him.

This strategy aims to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a favorable price for Alice."
