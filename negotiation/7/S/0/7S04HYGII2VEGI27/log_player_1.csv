Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($14,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my willingness to sell, which might make Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy gives me the best chance of getting a price significantly above my minimum."
