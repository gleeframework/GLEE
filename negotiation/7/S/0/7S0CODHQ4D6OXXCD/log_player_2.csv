Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $115 is still too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $115, it's still too high for Bob. He's willing to pay $105, and there's room for negotiation.  It's worth another round to try to get closer to his target price."
