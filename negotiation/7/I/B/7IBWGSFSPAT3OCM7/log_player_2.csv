Alice's offer:

How about we settle on $1,400,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and at $1,350,000, the price is below your maximum budget and a decent savings compared to John's offer. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better outcome, and risks pushing Alice away from the deal."
