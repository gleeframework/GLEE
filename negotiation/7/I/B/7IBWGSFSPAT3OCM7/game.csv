"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product's worth is significantly higher, and I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we settle on $1,400,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit far off from that number. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I can realistically accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we need.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
