"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my final offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",10250.0,Alice,5,
