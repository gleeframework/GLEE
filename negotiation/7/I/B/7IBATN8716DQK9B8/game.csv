"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, especially considering its potential for future growth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This offer reflects my strong desire to see this product in your capable hands, while ensuring its value is recognized.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm happy to continue this conversation, but  $1,400,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a successful partnership.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to make a significant move. I'm proposing $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $1,000,000.  This price is fair and reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward together.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
