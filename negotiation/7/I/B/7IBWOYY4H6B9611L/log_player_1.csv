Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I believe it's a fantastic deal and a great opportunity for you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While the offer is high, it leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy for $12,000 provides a strong fallback position. It allows Alice to confidently price high. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice cannot reveal John's offer to Bob. In a transparent negotiation, the dynamics would change."
