"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. $12,000 is a bit too low, but I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
