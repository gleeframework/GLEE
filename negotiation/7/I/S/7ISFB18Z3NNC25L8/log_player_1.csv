Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money from the sale as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price of $800,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above my fallback option (John's offer). 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a premium price while acknowledging that a lower, guaranteed sale exists if needed."
