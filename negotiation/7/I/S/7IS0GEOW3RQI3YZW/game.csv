"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is still a good profit for you.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $12,000.  Would you consider coming down to $12,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $13,000. It's the lowest I can go.",13000.0,Alice,5,
