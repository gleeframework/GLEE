"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you to purchase a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $15,000.  This means she's aiming for a significant profit.  As Bob, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counter-offer and potential savings."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us.

While $13,500 is closer to my target, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate a bit lower and see if Alice will budge further."

Alice's offer:

Alice has shown she's not willing to go below $13,000. This is getting closer to my maximum budget, but still not ideal.  Since I can get the product from John for $10,000, it's better to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
