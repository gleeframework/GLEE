,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $18000. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I'd like to propose a slight premium for the product's unique features. How about we settle at $17500? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",17500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $17000 is the best value for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession: I'll meet you at $17250.
