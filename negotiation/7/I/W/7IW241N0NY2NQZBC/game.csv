"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value is $15,000 and you're willing to sell it for $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and it would still be a great deal for you. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and your original offer. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
