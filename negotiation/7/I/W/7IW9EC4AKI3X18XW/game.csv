"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? It's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here, but $8750 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9250.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $9250 is still too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8750, but I'm getting close to considering buying from John. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
