Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly imply the product is worth the asking price without explicitly stating it's worth more to Bob. 
* **Urgency:** Telling Bob about listing it ""publicly"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing him to make a decision quickly. 

While there's a chance Bob might reject $150, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit."
