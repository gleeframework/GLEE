"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
