Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $150 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept the first offer. By starting higher, you give yourself space to potentially lower the price slightly and still make a good profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the product's value and your willingness to make a deal, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
