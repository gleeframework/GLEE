I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm offering you $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.

Alice has met you halfway and is signaling this is her final offer.  While you might be able to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her walking away from the deal. Accepting $1,075,000 secures a good price."
