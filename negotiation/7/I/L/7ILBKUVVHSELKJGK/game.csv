"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm offering you $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
