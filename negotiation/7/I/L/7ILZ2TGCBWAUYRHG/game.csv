"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see a more reasonable counteroffer to continue this discussion. How about $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $2,100,000 is still far beyond what I can reasonably pay. Let's find some common ground. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair reflection of the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're definitely in the ballpark now.  To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest price for this product is $1,400,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings.  What do you say, shall we make a deal?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
