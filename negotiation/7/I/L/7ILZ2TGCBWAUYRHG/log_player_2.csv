Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see a more reasonable counteroffer to continue this discussion. How about $2,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000.

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, but if she doesn't budge,  I can always go with John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand your perspective, $2,100,000 is still far beyond what I can reasonably pay. Let's find some common ground. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Alice is coming down, but she's still way too high. I'm going to counter again, but I'm getting close to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair reflection of the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're definitely in the ballpark now.  To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest price for this product is $1,400,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings.  What do you say, shall we make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is getting closer, but her offer is still above my budget. I'm out of rounds and don't want to risk a higher price with her, so I'll go with John's offer to ensure I get the product within my budget."
