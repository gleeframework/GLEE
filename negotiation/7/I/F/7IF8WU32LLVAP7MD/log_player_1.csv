"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a significant discount for Bob, who values the product at $12,000, making it more likely he'll accept. However, it also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers, and ensures I still get a profit beyond my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I can still do better.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

I'm countering with $11,200. This is still a good deal for Bob, but it's closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping this will lead to a quick agreement without risking losing him entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,900 is very close to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a better price with only 6 rounds left. It's time to secure the sale."
