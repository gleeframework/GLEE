Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is close to my minimum price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential higher valuation of the product. This approach aims to start the negotiation efficiently and see if Bob is willing to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $11,750 is still below my desired price, it's closer to my minimum and is a decent deal considering Bob's counteroffers.  I'm satisfied with this offer and it's better than selling to John."
