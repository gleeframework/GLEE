,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. How about we try $1,175,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within a budget, and I respect that. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,200,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly reflects the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not comfortable going any lower than that.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
