This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum value but gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a good value for you. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$1,200,000 is still below my minimum price, but it's a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer.  It's getting closer to my desired range, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
