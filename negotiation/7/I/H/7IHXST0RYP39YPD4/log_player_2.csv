"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $14,000 is less than $15,000.
* **The product is within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

While you could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
