"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can agree on this.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $10,875. This is a fair compromise that will get us both closer to our goals. I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $10,875 is still a little outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $10,800, which is a very fair price for both of us. This would be the final offer I can make. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,6,
