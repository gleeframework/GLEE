Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $10,875. This is a fair compromise that will get us both closer to our goals. I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $10,875 is still a little outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $10,800, which is a very fair price for both of us. This would be the final offer I can make. What do you think?
