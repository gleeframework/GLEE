"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to buy from Alice at her initial offer. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's worth exploring if you can get a better price. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is a strong opening move, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear expectation of a lower price. This should encourage Alice to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still not low enough to be a good deal.  I can continue to try and negotiate a better price as I still have 7 rounds remaining and John's offer is always a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a better deal. It also allows for more negotiation space, hoping Alice will meet me halfway."
