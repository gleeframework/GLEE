,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $15,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",16500.0,Bob,4,
