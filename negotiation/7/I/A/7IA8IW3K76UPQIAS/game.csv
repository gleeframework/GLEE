"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $1400000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1350000. I'm making a significant concession by offering you a price that's $50000 below my initial offer. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1275000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I still think $1275000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1290000. This is my final offer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1290000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my initial offer of $1500000. I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1400000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1400000.0,Alice,9,
