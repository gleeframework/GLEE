{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, which is important for him to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, and you still won't have to settle for less than your minimum. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too high, which could scare Bob off, but it's high enough to signal that you're serious about getting a good price for your product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I need to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference?  I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This gives you a great deal and lets me get closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose $860,000 as a compromise. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $860,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get as close to my minimum as possible."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $880,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to propose $855,000 as my final offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $855,000.

While $855,000 is close to my target, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000 for this product.  John has already offered that amount, so I'm going to sell the product to John."
