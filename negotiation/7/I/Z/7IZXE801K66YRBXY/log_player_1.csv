Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1,500,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to go higher than $1,500,000. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, it's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the guaranteed deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him dropping his offer further, leaving you with a less favorable outcome."
