{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you.  My starting price is $17,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise.
* **Show Value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with a question to keep the conversation open and invite Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $17000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I remind Bob that the product is still a great deal for him, even at the higher price.
* **Direct Approach:**  I make a clear counteroffer with a specific price, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $15250. This way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, this offer is a good compromise.  It's a reasonable profit for me and a fair price for Bob.  It's time to accept and move on!"
