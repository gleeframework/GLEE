# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make you a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a steal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save Bob $200,000."
