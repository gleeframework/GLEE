Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum limit.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
