**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,050,000. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's counteroffer is still above your target price of $1,000,000.  You can likely negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer the product to you for $1,075,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge further. Although her offer is closer to your target price, it's still above your budget. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John for your desired price.  The risk of further negotiation could result in losing the opportunity to purchase from John, and you're unlikely to get a better deal from Alice."
