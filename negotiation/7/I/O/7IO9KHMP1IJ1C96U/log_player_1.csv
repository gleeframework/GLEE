I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and a potentially beneficial deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob at $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant profit for me. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still a significant improvement over selling to John.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
