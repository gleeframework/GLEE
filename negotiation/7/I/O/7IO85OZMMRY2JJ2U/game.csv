"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $550,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing a new price of $650,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's exceptional quality and uniqueness.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $650,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $580,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",580000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make another concession to get closer to a mutually beneficial price. I'm proposing a new price of $620,000, which is still a bit above your offer but reflects the product's unique value. I'm confident we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",620000.0,Alice,5,

I'm hoping we can finally find a mutually beneficial price.",570000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $570,000.

I'm proposing a new price of $610,000, which is still a bit above your offer but reflects the product's unique value. I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",610000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one last concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $595,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing a price of $587,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. If this is not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800,000.",587500.0,Bob,10,
