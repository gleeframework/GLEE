"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $850,000 is below my initial offer, it's still not quite meeting my expectations. Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop the price to $900,000. This reflects a fair balance between our desired prices. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $875,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $890,000. This is a fair offer that takes into account both our needs. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $890,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $882,500. This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal.",882500.0,Bob,6,
