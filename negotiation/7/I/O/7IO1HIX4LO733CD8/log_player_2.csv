"Round 1

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its true value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than my ideal price. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $850,000 is below my initial offer, it's still not quite meeting my expectations. Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop the price to $900,000. This reflects a fair balance between our desired prices. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $900,000 is still above my ideal price point. I want to continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000.  I'll try to find common ground with Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $875,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $890,000. This is a fair offer that takes into account both our needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price point, but $890,000 is still slightly higher than my last counteroffer. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to reach a price closer to $875,000. There's still potential to get a better deal without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $890,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $882,500. This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 882500}
