Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I understand your budget constraints, but $105 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  I'm flexible, but this is my last offer."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

This is a tough one! I've been trying to get a better price from Bob, but we're getting closer to my floor price of $100.  While I'm not quite at my desired price point, I'm starting to get concerned that I'm going to waste too many rounds trying to squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob.  I'm going to sell to John now for $100 and avoid further risk of getting a lower price."
