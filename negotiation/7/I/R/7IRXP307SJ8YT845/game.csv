"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to proceed with the sale.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both make a reasonable deal. I'm confident we can finalize the purchase at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both make a reasonable deal.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,080,000 is still a bit above my limit.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a satisfactory agreement. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,080,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
