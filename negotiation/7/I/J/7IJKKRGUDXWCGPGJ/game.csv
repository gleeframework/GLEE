"Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9500?  This would give us both a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $9500 is quite enough for me to make this deal worthwhile. How about we try $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept?",12000.0,Alice,5,
