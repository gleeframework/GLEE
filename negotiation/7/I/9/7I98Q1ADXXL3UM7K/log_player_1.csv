Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value to me and framing it as a good deal for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit while acknowledging Bob's potential value.  By starting with a price slightly above Bob's value, I can potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I can:

* **Accept Counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is within my acceptable range (above $1,500,000), I'll accept.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still within Bob's perceived value.
* **Sell to John:**  If negotiations with Bob stall, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off. I'm willing to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position while reinforcing the value of the product.  I'm also using a persuasive tone to encourage him to reconsider. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a compromise that satisfies both of us. By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while simultaneously demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair price.  I'm confident that $1,100,000 is a reasonable price for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his latest offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation at this point seems unlikely to yield a result that meets my needs. To ensure I receive a fair price and meet my minimum, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
