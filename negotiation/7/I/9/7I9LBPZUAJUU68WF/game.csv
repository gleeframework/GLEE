"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is still outside of my budget. I could go up to $700,000 if you're willing to meet me closer to my price point.",700000.0,Bob,4,
