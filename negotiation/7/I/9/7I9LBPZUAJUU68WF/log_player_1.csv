Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed offer from John."
