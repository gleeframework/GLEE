"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,062,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,068,750?  That's a small step closer to your offer, and it keeps us both within a reasonable range. Let's see if we can close this out.",1068750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,068,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking to my last offer of $1,062,500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
