"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $4,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $4,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $10,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However,  $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could potentially go up to $6,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $6,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
