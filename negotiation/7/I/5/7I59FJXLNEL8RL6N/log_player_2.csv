"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it.  I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $175 is higher than my budget and what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $175 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a much lower offer to see how much wiggle room there is. It's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, I can still try to get closer to John's price.  It's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I see where you're coming from. How about we settle at $125? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

I'm moving closer to her price, but still aiming for a significant saving compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $125 is still a bit low for me. How about $135?  This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $135 is a decent price compared to John's $150. It's time to accept the deal."
