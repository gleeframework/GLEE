Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but still allows for a good profit.  I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $85 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $80.  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's no guarantee that I will. Accepting Bob's offer ensures that I get my minimum price and avoid any further risk."
