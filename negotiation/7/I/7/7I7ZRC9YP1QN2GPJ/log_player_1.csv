Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my target of $10,000.  However, I am willing to accept a lower price than John's offer, so I have a margin for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer to what I'm willing to accept than my initial offer. I will reject it and counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above his initial price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want to get as close to my target as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and is only $1,000 less than John's offer. Accepting this offer ensures I get a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
