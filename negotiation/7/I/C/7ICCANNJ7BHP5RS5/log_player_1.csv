Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 or more to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $130. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, so we don't want to go below that amount.

By offering the product at $130, Alice has a good chance of maximizing her profit while still ensuring a high likelihood of making the sale."
