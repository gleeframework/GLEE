Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and would like to counter your offer with a price of $85. This still offers a great value compared to the product's worth of $100, while also addressing your budget concerns.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm still aiming for a price closer to $80. It's worth another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $84 for the product, which is slightly above your offer but still provides some savings compared to its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $84 is a good price. It's time to accept the offer and avoid potentially missing out on the deal entirely."
