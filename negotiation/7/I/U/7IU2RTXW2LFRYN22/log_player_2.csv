"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product.  However, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is my best price for now, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's offer is slightly better than the initial one, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He can continue negotiating by making another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. Let's see if this is the sweet spot for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is still higher than his ideal price, it's a significant improvement over John's price of $12,000.  At this point, it's a good time to accept the offer to avoid further negotiations and potential for the deal to fall through.  Bob has secured a good price, and there's a risk of losing the product altogether if he continues to negotiate."
