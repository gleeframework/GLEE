"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product.  However, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is my best price for now, so let me know if you're interested!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. Let's see if this is the sweet spot for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
