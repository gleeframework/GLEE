Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but maximizing my potential profit.
* **Building rapport:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, creating a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Flexibility:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter, allowing for a potentially win-win outcome.
* **Backup plan:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to push for a better deal.
* **Opportunity to maximize profit:**  I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000 by negotiating further. 
* **Avoiding settling:** Accepting Bob's offer would be settling for less than my initial target. 

**Next step:** I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?  It's a good compromise and lets us both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""good compromise"" aspect, making the offer more appealing.
* **Motivating factor:** Mentioning ""both walk away satisfied"" subtly reminds Bob of the value he places on the product.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the gap:** Reduce the difference between our positions.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Leave room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Increase potential profit:** Achieve a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my initial offer, which was already a good starting point. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away, potentially leaving me with the $1,000,000 offer from John. 
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation would consume time and effort without a guarantee of a significantly better outcome.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit, minimizes risk, and avoids further negotiation."
