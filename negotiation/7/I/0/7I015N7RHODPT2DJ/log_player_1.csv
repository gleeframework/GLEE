Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start the conversation.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $20,000, there's space for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still leaving me room to potentially negotiate down closer to my minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will also help gauge how interested Bob is in the product. His response will give me a better sense of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, so accepting $10,000 would be leaving money on the table.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  Could you do $17,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  Importantly, I'm still aiming for a price higher than what John is offering ($15,000). My goal is to maximize profit, and settling for anything less than $15,000 at this point wouldn't make sense.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  While I'm aiming high, there's still room to negotiate further downwards if Bob pushes back."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $17,000 is out of my budget. I am prepared to offer $12,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $15,000 and shows he's unlikely to meet my valuation.  Continuing to negotiate risks missing out on John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move forward with selling to John for a secure $15,000."
