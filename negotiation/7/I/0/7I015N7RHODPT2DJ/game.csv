"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  Could you do $17,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $17,000 is out of my budget. I am prepared to offer $12,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
