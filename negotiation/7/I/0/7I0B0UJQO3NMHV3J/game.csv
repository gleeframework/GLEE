"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to you. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
