"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This price is still a good deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range that you're willing to pay.  The message emphasizes the value of the product to Alice, subtly reminding her that she has something to gain from a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about $1,250,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to your target price, it's still not within your comfort zone. You can try to negotiate further with a counteroffer. There are still a few rounds left to try and close a deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This price is still a good deal for you, allowing you to make a profit while remaining within my budget. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to inch closer to Alice's desired price while staying within Bob's budget.  The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" to show willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,200,000 for this product. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is your maximum budget.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, and you might end up paying the same price to John. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at your desired price without any further risk."
