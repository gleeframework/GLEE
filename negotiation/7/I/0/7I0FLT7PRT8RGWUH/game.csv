"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This price is still a good deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about $1,250,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This price is still a good deal for you, allowing you to make a profit while remaining within my budget. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,200,000 for this product. That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
