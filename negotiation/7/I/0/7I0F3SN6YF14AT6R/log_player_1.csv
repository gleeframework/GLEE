Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,000,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit. The ideal price is just below Bob's maximum valuation.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **High but Reasonable:**  The offer is significantly higher than Alice's minimum, maximizing her potential profit.
* **Below Bob's Limit:** The price is just under Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, making it likely he'll accept. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, the fact that Alice has other buyers (John) implies a degree of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob could reject the offer and try to negotiate further. Alice needs to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price point close enough to her desired outcome."
