Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe will be valuable to you. I think a fair price is $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** While the offered price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the message includes a justification (""I believe will be valuable to you"") to make it seem reasonable. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for a discussion that could lead to a mutually agreeable price above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
