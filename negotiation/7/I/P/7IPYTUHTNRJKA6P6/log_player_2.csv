It's always worth exploring options, and $9,000 is a good starting point.  Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $7,000.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but I'm still within my budget. We'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not convinced. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm raising my offer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. Hopefully, she'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer! While $8,200 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, I think we can squeeze out a bit more with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer to $8,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, but it still leaves me with some room to negotiate.  I'm hopeful that Alice will see this as a sign of good faith and accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $8,100, which is pretty close to my last counteroffer. I'm not sure if we'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'll accept the offer and save myself the potential headache of further negotiation."
