Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something that can significantly benefit you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reinforcing why he should be willing to pay a premium. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, aiming higher with Bob first maximizes your potential earnings."
