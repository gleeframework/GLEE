"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more balanced price that reflects the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
