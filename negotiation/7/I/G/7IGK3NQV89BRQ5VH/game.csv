"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great value for a product worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",9250.0,Bob,4,
