Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the potential benefit for Bob, emphasizing the price is lower than what the product is worth to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potential mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Plan B:** Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can make further counteroffers, knowing I have a guaranteed $12,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price but still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there is still room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to pay a bit more than his initial $8,000 valuation.
* **Leverage of John:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's current offer. 

I will counter-offer Bob to try and get a price closer to my target value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great value for a product worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering at $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him that he's getting a good deal even at my counter-offer price.
* **""Middle Ground"" Approach:** The phrase ""middle ground"" implies that further negotiation is possible, encouraging Bob to make a final offer closer to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding John:** I'm still trying to avoid selling to John at $12,000, as a deal with Bob would be more profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my desired price range. While it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John at a lower profit.
* **Time Factor:**  Each round of negotiation takes time, and I want to close this deal sooner rather than later. 

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a good profit. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer."
