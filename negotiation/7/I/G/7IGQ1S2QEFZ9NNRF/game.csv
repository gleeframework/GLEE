"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $9000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11000 to make this work for me.  Could you consider a price of $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $9500 for the product. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9500.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10000?  That's a good price for both of us, and it would save us both time and effort on further negotiation.",10000.0,Alice,5,
