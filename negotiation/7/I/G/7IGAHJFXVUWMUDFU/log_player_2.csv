Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $10,500? That's a good compromise, and still gives you a great deal. Let's make this happen!

While $10,500 is closer to your limit, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
