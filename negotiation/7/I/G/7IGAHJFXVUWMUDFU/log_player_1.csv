Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to engage in further negotiation while leaving you some room to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $10,500? That's a good compromise, and still gives you a great deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm confident John will purchase the product for $15,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I will sell the product to John."
