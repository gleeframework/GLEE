"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a backup option to buy from John for $15,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be happy to buy it for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $14,000, which is still within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000.  Accepting the offer saves me $1,000."
