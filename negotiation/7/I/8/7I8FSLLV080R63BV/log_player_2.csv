{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $140, which is more than Bob's maximum price of $120. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**  Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $120 to Alice, so he offers $110, leaving some room for negotiation. This counteroffer is within Bob's budget and could potentially entice Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** While Alice's offer of $125 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price of $120. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price.  There are still rounds remaining, and he can always buy from John for $120 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:** 

Bob is trying to gradually decrease the price. Since Alice rejected $110, he offers $115, which is still within his budget and might be more appealing to Alice than his previous offer. This move shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is still determined to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 is now within Bob's budget. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a lower price, and he risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product at his maximum price point."
