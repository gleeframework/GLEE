Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you aim to get as close to that as possible with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a significant potential profit margin while still being an attractive proposition for Bob, as it's considerably less than the $1,500,000 you'd get from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and make a decision. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
