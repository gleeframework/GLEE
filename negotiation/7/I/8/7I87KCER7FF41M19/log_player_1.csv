Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
