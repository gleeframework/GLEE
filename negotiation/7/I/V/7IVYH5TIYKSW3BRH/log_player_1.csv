"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a profit.  Bob is likely to reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. It's a more realistic price that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.  Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer, but I'm ready to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is the same as his last offer. I've already rejected this price once, and the remaining rounds are limited.  It's likely that Bob won't budge further, and while I'd like to get closer to $10,000, securing a sale now is more important."
