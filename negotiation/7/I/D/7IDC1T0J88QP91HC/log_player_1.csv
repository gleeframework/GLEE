This offer gives me a good starting point, while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed fallback option with John, so I can be somewhat firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,100,000 for the product. I believe it's a bit overpriced, and I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, my goal is to maximize profit. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,150,000 for the product. I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer. I believe there's still room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum threshold. Let's split the difference one more time.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,175,000. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1,125,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle one more time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting a bit tedious, and Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed offer from John."
