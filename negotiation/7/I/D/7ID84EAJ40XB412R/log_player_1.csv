{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your $8,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** It gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price leaves room for counteroffers and negotiations without making you feel like you're giving away too much. 

Remember, if Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your counteroffers based on his responses and the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than $8,000, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to meet Bob halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
