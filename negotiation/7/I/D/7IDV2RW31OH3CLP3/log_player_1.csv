Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it offers significant value, especially considering it's worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is $100, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. This leaves us room to potentially settle somewhere between $100 and our minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Highlighting Value:**  By mentioning that the product is worth $120 to Bob, we emphasize the deal's value proposition, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, we have a safety net with John, ensuring we can still sell the product for our minimum acceptable price."
