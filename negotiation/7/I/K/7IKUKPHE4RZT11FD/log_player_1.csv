Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's something you've had your eye on and it holds significant value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000 before I finalize a deal with another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

Here's why this offer is strategic:

* **High but justifiable price:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000). This creates room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""another interested party"" adds a time pressure element, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly and accept a higher price than he might otherwise consider.
* **Direct and confident:** The message is straightforward and positions the product's value to Bob.  

By starting high, you leave room to potentially negotiate downwards if Bob counters your initial offer."
