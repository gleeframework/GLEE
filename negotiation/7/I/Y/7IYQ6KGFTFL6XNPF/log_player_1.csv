Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, I can always counteroffer closer to my minimum or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob's offer is my minimum price, accepting it guarantees me the best possible outcome."
