"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.
