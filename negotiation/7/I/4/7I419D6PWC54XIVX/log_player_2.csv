Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}

Alice has returned to her initial offer. This suggests that she may be unwilling to budge further. However, we still have three rounds left. I will continue to counter-offer, as we've shown progress in previous rounds. It's still possible to get a better deal before resorting to John."
