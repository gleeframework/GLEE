"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can likely get it for less than $140 since it's worth $120 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $130. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price, and it's closer to your desired price point.  There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price in the next round, so it's best to accept this offer."
