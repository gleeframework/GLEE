"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to be flexible,  $8,500 is too low for me right now. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for less."
