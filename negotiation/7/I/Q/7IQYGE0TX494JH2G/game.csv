"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is a great opportunity, but I have to consider my budget carefully.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  The value of this product is undeniable, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about we try $950,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be willing to move forward at that price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see a price closer to my valuation. Let's do this - if you agree to $980,000, we have a deal. It's a small move, but shows we're both serious about reaching an agreement.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not convinced $980,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm excited about the potential of this product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",960000.0,Bob,6,
