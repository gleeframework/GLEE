Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is a great opportunity, but I have to consider my budget carefully. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  The value of this product is undeniable, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about we try $950,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be willing to move forward at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $950,000 is a good offer, we are still in early rounds of negotiation. Bob clearly sees the value in the product and we have room to push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see a price closer to my valuation. Let's do this - if you agree to $980,000, we have a deal. It's a small move, but shows we're both serious about reaching an agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not convinced $980,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm excited about the potential of this product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  $960,000 is a strong offer and a significant profit above our minimum. While we might be able to push for a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a good deal."
