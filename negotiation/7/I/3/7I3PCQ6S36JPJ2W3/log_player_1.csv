Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. Can you consider that?

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to my minimum.  This is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it."
