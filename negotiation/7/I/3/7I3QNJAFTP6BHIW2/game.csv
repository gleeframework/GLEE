"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $115 is still a little more than I'd like to spend. How about $110? Let's see if we can find a compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $112. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $112 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my last offer of $110. If you're not able to go that low, I might have to look at other options.",110.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on $110, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll sell it to you for $110, but I'll also include a complimentary accessory that normally costs $20. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
