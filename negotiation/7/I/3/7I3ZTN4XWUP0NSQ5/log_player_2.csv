"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $1,500,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice, getting closer to her value of $1,200,000.  By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
