"I understand that $800,000 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do.",825000.0,Alice,5,
