Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Alice is very close to her lowest acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate could push her away from the deal, and while I could try to get a lower price, $825,000 is a fair compromise."
