$75 is far below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."

$100 is still below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, though, so I need to start being more aggressive in my negotiations."

I'm going to lower my price a bit more to try and reach a compromise with Bob, but I'm not going to go below $150."
