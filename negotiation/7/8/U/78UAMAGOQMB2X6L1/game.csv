"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me.  While I agree your product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I would be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a significant investment for me. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $725,000?  I'm eager to acquire this product and believe this offer would be mutually beneficial.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. To be completely transparent, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $800,000.  However, I prefer your product and believe it's worth a slight premium.  Would you be willing to settle at $775,000? This would allow me to work with you and justify the added expense.",775000.0,Bob,6,
