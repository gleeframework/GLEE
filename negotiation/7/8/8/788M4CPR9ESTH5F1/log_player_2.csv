"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly above her minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  As Bob, I want to get the best price possible and save as much money as I can.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,100,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're committed to your offer of $950,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price of $950,000.  Bob is committed to his offer, and it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can get Alice to come down further. There are still rounds available to explore a better price, and buying from John at $1,500,000 is not an appealing option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. I think this is the lowest price I can reasonably accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. If Bob rejects Alice's offer, it's likely Alice will hold firm at $1,050,000 or even increase the price.
* **Price Gap:** The price gap between Alice's offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's desired price ($1,000,000) is now relatively small.
* **John's Price:** Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a significantly worse deal.

While Bob can continue to try and negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and having to buy from John at a much higher price is increasing.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to secure the product at a reasonable price within the remaining rounds."
