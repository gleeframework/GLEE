"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,100,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and reflects the product's true value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're committed to your offer of $950,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win situation.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. I think this is the lowest price I can reasonably accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
