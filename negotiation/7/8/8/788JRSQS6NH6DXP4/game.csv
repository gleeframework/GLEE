"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. $125 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $122.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",122.5,Alice,5,
