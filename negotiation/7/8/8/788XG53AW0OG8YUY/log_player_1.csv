Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500.  I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but offering it at full price to Bob is unlikely to work since he values it less.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $10,000 gives you leverage. Bob doesn't need to know about John specifically, but the offer implies you have other options."
