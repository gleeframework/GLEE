"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $1400000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This reflects the product's significant value and provides a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts on this revised offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
