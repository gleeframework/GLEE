"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $95 is within your budget, you can save more money by rejecting Alice's offer. You know John will sell the product for $100, but there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price in a second round of negotiation."
