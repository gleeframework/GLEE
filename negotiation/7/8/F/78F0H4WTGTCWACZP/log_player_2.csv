"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1250000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is only $50,000 above Bob's maximum, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the market value.  Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is the minimum I can accept given the value of the product.  This price is still fair considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is now equal to Bob's maximum price.  There's no further room for negotiation, and it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer to avoid losing the product to another seller.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject and Bob will have to buy from John for the same price."
