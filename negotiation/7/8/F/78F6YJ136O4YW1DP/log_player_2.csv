# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm asking for $19,000. I believe in being transparent with potential buyers, and while this is above your stated value, I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price compared to what others would be willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000.
