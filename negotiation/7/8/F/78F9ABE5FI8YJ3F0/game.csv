"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this offer balances both our needs. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $17,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to my work. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
