Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:** We start just below your minimum acceptable price to maximize potential profit.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a touch of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing on the price itself, the message highlights the ""great deal"" aspect. 

While there's a chance Bob might negotiate, this strategy gives you a strong starting point. If he rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed your minimum price from John."
