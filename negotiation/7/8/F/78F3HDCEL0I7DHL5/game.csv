"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This is still a good price for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a reasonable profit, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10,000. Would you be willing to accept that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
