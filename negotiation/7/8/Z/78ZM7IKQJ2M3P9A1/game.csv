"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $950000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's value to you and my own investment, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1050000. This price reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer and is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1025000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Can you consider this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
