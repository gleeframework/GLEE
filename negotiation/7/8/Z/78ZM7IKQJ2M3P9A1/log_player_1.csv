Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. My starting price is $1,150,000. This is a great opportunity for both of us, and I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired value by continuing the negotiation. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's value to you and my own investment, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer and is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1025000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and represents a good compromise.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
