Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $11,350?

Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and at this point, further haggling might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting at $11,350 is still a decent saving compared to John's $15,000 price."
