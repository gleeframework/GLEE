"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Considering its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,175,000, which would be $1,112,500. Would you be open to considering this price?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference between your last offer and my previous one? That would be $1,143,750. It's a fantastic deal for a high-value product.",1143750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,143,750 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,143,750 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,096,875. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1096875.0,Bob,6,
