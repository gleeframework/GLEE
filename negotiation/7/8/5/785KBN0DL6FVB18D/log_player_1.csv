Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000.  I believe it holds significant value that could greatly benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message hints at the product's value, it avoids being overly specific. This lets Bob consider the offer without feeling pressured by detailed arguments.
* **Fallback:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will purchase it at my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move.  Depending on Bob's response, I may negotiate down the price. However, I want to start strong to maximize my potential profit."
