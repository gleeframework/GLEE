"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to acquire the product for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. To demonstrate my serious interest in acquiring this product, I'm willing to go up to $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go up to $975,000. I believe this is the sweet spot where both of us can benefit. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975,000 is still a bit out of reach.  I'm willing to go up to $940,000. I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",940000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $940,000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I'm still not ready to give in. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $960,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",960000.0,Alice,7,
