"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to you, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. I am offering it to you for $10,000 today. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. This price is within my budget and still represents a fair value for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer is $9,500, which is still within Bob's budget of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the difference between $9,500 and $9,000 is minimal. 
* **Time:** It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob might not want to risk losing the product to another buyer. 
* **Savings:** Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John.

Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to get the product within budget and move on from the negotiation."
