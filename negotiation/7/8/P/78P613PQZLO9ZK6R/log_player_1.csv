Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Since you have a backup offer, you can aim higher than your minimum. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward and positions the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you ($150,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a substantial discount ($150,000 below his perceived value).
* **No Room for Haggling (Implied):** By starting strong, you signal that this is a serious offer, and you're not desperate to haggle.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is more important than maximizing profit in this single transaction, you might consider a slightly lower price.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher to leave room for negotiation.

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your approach if Bob comes back with a counter-offer."
