Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $80? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $80. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is unique, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $90. Let's try to find a compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $105? It's still a good price for the product, and I'm willing to make a concession to reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet halfway, but $105 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $95. I'm running out of room in my budget, so I really hope we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're running out of budget, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make another concession to reach an agreement. How about we meet at $102? It's still a good price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $102 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $98, and I hope this is a final offer that we can both agree on.",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're making a final offer, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. How about we meet at $100? It's the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",100.0,Alice,9,
