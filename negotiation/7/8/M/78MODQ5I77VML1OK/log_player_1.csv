{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000),** giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value ($12,000),** leaving you open to accepting a higher counteroffer if necessary.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  This can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

I'll keep an eye on Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there any wiggle room in your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is higher than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000.  Selling to John for $12,000 would be the most profitable option right now, but I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob. 

I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you on this."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer,** demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not give in completely.
* **It's lower than my initial offer,** showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **The message is still friendly and emphasizes the benefit for both of us.** This helps keep the negotiation positive. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to consider further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is the closest I can get to the price I'm comfortable with. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I've already made a significant concession and Bob seems unwilling to budge further. It's time to cut my losses and move on. Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
