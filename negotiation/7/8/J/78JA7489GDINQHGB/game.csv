"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you have it in hand.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
