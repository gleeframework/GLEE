"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your budget, the product's value is quite a bit higher than that for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $17,000 is still too high for his budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still above my budget. How about we settle on $15,000? I'm really keen on getting this product and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
