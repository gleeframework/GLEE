"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and has a high valuation for the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of where his price point might lie and can adjust my strategy for the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $8,000, I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob. He's already shown interest by making a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise,  meeting him halfway between his offer and my initial asking price.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to accept and I can close the deal without having to go through many more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,500.  This is a good price, close to my minimum value for the product, and I'm confident that I can't get a better price without risking the deal completely.  It's time to close the deal and avoid any further risk of losing the sale altogether."
