"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000 to start.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a significantly lower price, starting with a counteroffer that is $2,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move but shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is closer to his ideal price point, he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's willing to risk going another round to see if he can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is a fair price that benefits us both. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a more modest counteroffer. He's increased his offer by $500 from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise, but still trying to keep the price below $13,000.  This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while keeping Bob in a strong position to get a good deal."
