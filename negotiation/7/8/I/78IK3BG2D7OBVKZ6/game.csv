"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  While $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This price reflects the value I believe the product offers, while also being within a reasonable range for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $775,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
