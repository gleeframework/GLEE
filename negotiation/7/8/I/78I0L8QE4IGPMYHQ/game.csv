"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $900000. This is a fair and competitive price considering the product's quality and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However,  $900000 is a bit lower than my current valuation. I'm willing to offer $1200000, which reflects the value I see in this unique item. I believe this price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering a price of $1100000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our initial offers. This price still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit below my current valuation. I'm happy to continue negotiating and propose a price of $1150000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for both of us. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1125000, which is slightly above my initial offer but still below your latest proposal. I believe this price is a fair compromise and reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
