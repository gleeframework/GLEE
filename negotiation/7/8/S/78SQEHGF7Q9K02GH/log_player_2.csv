"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for Alice to lower her price and Bob to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above his maximum budget. This approach allows for room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to his desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer than her initial offer, it's not yet within Bob's comfort zone. Bob should continue to negotiate, as there's still room for a lower price. He has the option to buy from John for $1,200,000 if he's unable to secure a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate. This is a strategic move to show Alice he's serious about buying but still aiming for a price within his budget.  This counteroffer is a compromise, potentially closer to what Alice may accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still higher.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is risky. There's no guarantee she'll lower the price enough to make it worth it for Bob.  Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product at his maximum budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
