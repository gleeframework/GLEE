Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we offer the product for $90? This is still above its perceived value by you, while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. We're glad to meet you halfway. Considering the value you place on the product, how does $85 sound as the final offer? This allows us to cover our costs while staying within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering the product for $85, which is within your $80 limit plus a small amount of wiggle room.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will increase the price or you'll run out of rounds. Accepting at $85 is a good compromise."
