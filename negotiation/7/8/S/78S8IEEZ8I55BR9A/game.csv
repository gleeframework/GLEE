"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budgetary constraints, but $950,000 falls quite short of the product's true value and potential for significant returns. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the $1,175,000 proposal. My maximum budget remains at $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this offers a more reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
