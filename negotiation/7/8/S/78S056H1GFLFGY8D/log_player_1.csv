Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is my minimum, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is a good price, and it's getting close to my initial offer.  It's not worth risking the sale to John for a potentially small gain."
