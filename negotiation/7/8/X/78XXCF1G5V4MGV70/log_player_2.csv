"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product for a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $110, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $108. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $108, which is still within your budget of $120.  Accepting her offer is the best option, as it's unlikely you'll be able to get it for any lower."
