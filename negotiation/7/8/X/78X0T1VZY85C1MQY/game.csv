"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective. While $2,000,000 represents a fair price considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I could let it go for $1,800,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my limit. Given our previous discussions, I'm offering $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's value to me,  while still allowing you a reasonable margin. Let's try to close the deal at this point.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
