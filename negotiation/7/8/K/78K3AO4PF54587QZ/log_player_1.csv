Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering what you'd be getting out of it."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80)
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
