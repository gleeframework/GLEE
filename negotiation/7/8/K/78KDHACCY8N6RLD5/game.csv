"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8000.  It's a great product, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,
