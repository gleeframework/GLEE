Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it will greatly benefit you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, and you can always come down a bit while still staying above your minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your willingness to make a deal, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for $10,000 from John. However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
