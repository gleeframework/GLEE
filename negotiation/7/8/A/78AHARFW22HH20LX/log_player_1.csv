"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  It's important to start high, as I don't know Bob's perceived value for the product. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest by how low his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more from Bob if I negotiate further.  It's still early in the process, and Bob's initial counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500 as my counteroffer. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum and allows for further bargaining.  It's important to show flexibility while also trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,000. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate. This offer is significantly higher than my minimum, and I'm confident it's a good deal. It's important to balance maximizing profit with closing the deal, and at this stage, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy."
