"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I recognize the value, $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we agree on $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $12,000? This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great value for you as well.",12000.0,Alice,5,
