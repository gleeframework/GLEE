"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. This is a great price, as it's worth at least $100 to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's.  Since you're trying to save money and the products are identical, there's no reason to buy from Alice. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
