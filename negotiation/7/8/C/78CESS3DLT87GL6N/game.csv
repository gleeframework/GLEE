,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $135. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $132 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a final compromise at $134. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already gone as low as I'm willing to go. I'm going to have to pass on your offer and consider other options. I think I'll sell the product to John for $120.",120.0,Alice,7,
