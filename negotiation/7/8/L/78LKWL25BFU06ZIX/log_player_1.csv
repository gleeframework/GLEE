Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I know John will buy the product for $150, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for the possibility of a quicker sale and potentially even higher profit if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $149 is just below my guaranteed sale price. This creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message hints at the product's value but leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price slightly high.  

This approach balances maximizing profit with the understanding that a slightly lower price might be more appealing to Bob and lead to a faster sale."
