Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still represents a substantial profit for you. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording suggests a willingness to negotiate, which could be beneficial if Bob counters with a lower offer."
