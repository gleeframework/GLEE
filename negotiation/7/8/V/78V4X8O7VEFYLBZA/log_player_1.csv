Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects its significant worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, increasing your profit. 
* **Strong but Fair:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the price while maintaining a collaborative tone.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a significantly higher profit outweighs settling for the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
