"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it while still staying within my price range.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our previous offers and acknowledges the value you see in the item.
