"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. I believe it would be a great asset to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a better deal can be reached before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to test Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $500 reduction is a reasonable starting point.
* **Staying within budget:** $11,000 is still within Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Building rapport:** The message is friendly and expresses interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $11,250 is still above Bob's budget.
* **Negotiation space:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. There's still room to reach a lower price.
* **Counteroffer potential:** Bob can counteroffer with a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,250 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we settle on $11,100?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to budget:** Bob is raising his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his intent to reach a deal. $11,100 is closer to his budget, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Compromise language:** The message emphasizes a desire for a fair compromise, which can help build rapport.
* **Setting the stage:** Bob's offer sets the stage for potential further concessions from Alice."
