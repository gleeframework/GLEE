"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? ",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,250 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we settle on $11,100?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11100.0,Bob,4,
