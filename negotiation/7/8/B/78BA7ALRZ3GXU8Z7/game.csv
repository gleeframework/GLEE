"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at $11,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I can offer it to you for $11,250. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",11250.0,Alice,5,
