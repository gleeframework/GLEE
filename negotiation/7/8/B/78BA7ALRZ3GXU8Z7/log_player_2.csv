"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**  Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at $11,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I can offer it to you for $11,250. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:** Alice's offer of $11,250 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, there's no guarantee that Bob will be able to get it below his budget within the remaining rounds.  Given the option to buy from John for $10,000, Bob is better off going with the guaranteed deal and avoiding further negotiation risk."
