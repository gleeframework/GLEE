Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

While it's not ideal to go below $125, Bob is firm on his $115 offer. It's better to accept the $115 than to risk him walking away and only getting $100 from John."
