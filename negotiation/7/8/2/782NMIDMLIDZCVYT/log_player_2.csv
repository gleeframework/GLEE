"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it at $120, there's no incentive to negotiate. You can buy it from John for the same price, so it's better to just buy it from him and avoid the hassle of negotiation."
