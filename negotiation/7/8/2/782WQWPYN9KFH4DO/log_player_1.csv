Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than $80, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is still above your minimum of $120, so you're not giving away the product for less than you want.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for both of you to compromise if necessary. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum value of $120 and even below Bob's own valuation of $80. Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **There's potential for a better deal:**  I can counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.  
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $120.

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $85 is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $65. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum value of $120, so I'm not losing money.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to budge closer to my desired price. 

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob!"
