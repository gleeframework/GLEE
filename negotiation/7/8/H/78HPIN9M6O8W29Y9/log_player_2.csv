"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $90 is more than your maximum budget of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:** You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's price is your fallback:**  While John's price is higher, it gives you a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer below Alice's price:** I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly lower than Alice's price to show I'm serious about buying but still negotiating.
* **Not too low:**  $85 is still above Alice's minimum of $80, making the offer reasonable.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $87 is below your maximum price of $100.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While you could try to get a lower price, you're already getting close to Alice's minimum. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice rejecting your counteroffers or you running out of rounds.  

By accepting Alice's offer, you secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
