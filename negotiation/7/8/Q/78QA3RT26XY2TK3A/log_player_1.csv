{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""deal"" while still securing a profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob is a tough negotiator, there's a small margin for me to potentially lower the price slightly and still come out ahead of selling to John."
