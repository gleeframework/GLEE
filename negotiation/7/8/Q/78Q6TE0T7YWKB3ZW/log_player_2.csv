Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $9,250.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
