"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which I think is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which is the highest I'm willing to go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  This way, we both get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $88, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",88.0,Bob,6,
