"I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $14,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still unable to accept that offer. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we try to find a price that works for both of us?",14000.0,Bob,4,
