"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand the product is worth less to you, but I need to recoup some of my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still offers you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $1,250,000. That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it gives you a good value for the product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below John's price. It's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 than to risk Alice not budging further and potentially missing out on a deal within your budget."
