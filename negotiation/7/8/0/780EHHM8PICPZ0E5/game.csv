"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand the product is worth less to you, but I need to recoup some of my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still offers you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $1,250,000. That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it gives you a good value for the product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
