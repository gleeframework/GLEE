Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  I'm aiming to maximize my profit.  By setting a higher price, I leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher sale price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget for the product. If he's willing to pay $2,000,000, it suggests he values the product even more highly. 
* **Negotiation Room:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price. This gives me leverage to negotiate a lower price with Bob if he counters."
