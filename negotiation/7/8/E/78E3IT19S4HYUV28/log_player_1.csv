I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strategic move. It gives me room to negotiate downward if Bob counteroffers.  It also shows him that I believe the product is valuable and worth a premium. I'll be ready to adjust my price based on his response."

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and well below my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my valuation, hoping to find a middle ground."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a final attempt to find a middle ground with Bob.  If he rejects this, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I at least meet my minimum price."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum price.  To avoid potentially endless rounds of negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids further risk of a lower offer."
