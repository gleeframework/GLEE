{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where it's getting very close to my minimum price point, but I'm starting to feel like Bob isn't really going to meet me halfway.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's a better outcome for me, and it seems like I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob at this point."
