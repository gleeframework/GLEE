"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could accept and walk away with something, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,700,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering my minimum value is $1,500,000.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up again.  I'm still confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, as it's still a significant amount of money for him and leaves me with a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to offer $1,550,000. This is just above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible and find a solution. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to make a final move and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're running out of time, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a deal I'm completely comfortable with. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk losing out to a lower offer from Bob."
