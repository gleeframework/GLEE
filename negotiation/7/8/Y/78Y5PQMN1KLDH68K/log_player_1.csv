Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is above your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still space for Bob to counteroffer without you having to immediately accept a price lower than you'd like.
* **It reflects the value to Bob:** Knowing the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, you're offering a price that's within his range, making it more likely he'll accept. 

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation.  You'll have to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, but that's my absolute top price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than you'd ideally like.  Rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  There's a good chance that Bob will be willing to pay slightly more than $8,500, especially since he acknowledged that your initial offer wasn't unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for $8,500. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** You're demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate and come down from your original price.
* **Stay above your minimum:** $9,000 is still higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you're still making a profit.
* **Be reasonable:** You're offering a price that's halfway between your original offer and Bob's offer, making it a more likely compromise.

Remember, the goal is to get the best price possible, but also keep in mind that negotiations take time.  If Bob doesn't accept your counteroffer, you can always consider selling to John or making another counteroffer."
