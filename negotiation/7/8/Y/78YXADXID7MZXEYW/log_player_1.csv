"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, knowing it's higher than Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** I highlight the benefit for both of us, hoping to make the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:** 

I want to maximize my profit while also giving Bob the opportunity to negotiate. I'm not starting at my absolute minimum to leave room for counteroffers, but I'm also not being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even lower than my initial offer. 
* **More negotiation needed:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that benefits both of us. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

**Strategy:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer. This will show him that I'm serious about getting a fair price, while still demonstrating flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $8,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows you to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (sort of):** I'm not meeting Bob halfway, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground while still staying above my minimum. This approach helps maintain momentum and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $9,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and much higher than Bob's initial offer of $8,500.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, and the risk of losing the deal to John increases with every round. 
* **Potential for future negotiations:** Even though I'm accepting this offer, there's still room for negotiation in the future if I decide to sell other products to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer, as it's a good deal considering the time constraint and the potential for future business. This way, I secure a sale and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower profit."
