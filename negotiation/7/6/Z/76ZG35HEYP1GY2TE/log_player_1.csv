Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and push for a higher price.  $1,200,000 is still a significant amount of money, and I believe there's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect its unique value. Let's compromise at $1,350,000. This gives us both a good deal and ensures I can fairly compensate for the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1350000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but if we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to try and push for a slightly higher price one more time before considering selling to John.  While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try one more time to find common ground.  I'm willing to drop the price to $1,250,000.

If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to reconsider my options."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been firm on his offer, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's clear that he won't budge on his price of $1,200,000.  While it's a significant amount of money, it's still less than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  It's better to sell to John for $1,000,000 than to risk losing the sale altogether and ending up with nothing."
