"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect its unique value. Let's compromise at $1350000. This gives us both a good deal and ensures I can fairly compensate for the product's potential.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1350000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but if we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try one more time to find common ground.  I'm willing to drop the price to $1250000. This shows my commitment to working with you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to reconsider my options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
