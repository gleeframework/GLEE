"While I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, reflecting its value and my desire to make a deal.  Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which reflects the product's value and my commitment to finding a deal.  Let's close this gap and finalize this purchase.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
