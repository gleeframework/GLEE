"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in purchasing but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept for this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $17,000?  This offer reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm really hoping to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
