,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's start our negotiations here.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see a more serious commitment from you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true value of what's on the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the value of this product. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I need a decision.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a strong commitment from my side. Let's see if we can find common ground here.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
