"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,150,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as you've indicated its value to be $1,200,000. While I'm confident I can find another buyer, I'd prefer to work with you. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John."
