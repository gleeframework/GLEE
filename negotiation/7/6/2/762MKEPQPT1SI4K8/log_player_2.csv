"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm aware it's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $1400000. This represents a substantial gain for you, and I'm confident it would be a valuable addition to your operations. Let me know your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is a good deal, but it's still above your ideal price point.
* **You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice.** This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or go to John for a higher price.**  Since you're aiming to save as much as possible, rejecting Alice's offer is the best initial move."
