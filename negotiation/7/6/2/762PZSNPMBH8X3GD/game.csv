"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell it. However, I can only afford to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet the price of $9,250. I propose $9,100 as my maximum offer for the product. I hope this might be within your acceptable range.",9100.0,Bob,4,
