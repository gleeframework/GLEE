"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8250? I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile investment at that price.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
