"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to your business. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $12,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to my business. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  I believe this price still represents excellent value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. Can you meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your business, $8,500 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. This represents a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit while offering you a valuable product.  I believe this is a price we can both agree on.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500, which would be $9,000. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer $9,250. Can you meet me at this price?",9250.0,Bob,6,
