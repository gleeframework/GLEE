"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
