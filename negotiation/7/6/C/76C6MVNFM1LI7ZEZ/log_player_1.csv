"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer of $1,400,000. This is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  This initial offer allows me to potentially decrease the price in subsequent rounds if necessary, while still aiming for a final price significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and suggesting a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is below my absolute minimum of $1,200,000.  While his counteroffer was aggressive, I'm confident there's still room to negotiate a price that works for both of us. I'll counter in the next round to guide the negotiation back towards a more acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation.  I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can go as low as $1,300,000. This is a very competitive offer, reflecting the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm holding firm above my $1,200,000 minimum but significantly reducing my asking price to show willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The $1,300,000 offer attempts to find a middle ground between Bob's low offer and my initial high offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little.  To be honest, I have a strict budget for this purchase. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my absolute minimum price. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he could walk away.  Accepting this offer ensures a successful deal and a good profit."
