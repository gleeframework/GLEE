"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation.  I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can go as low as $1,300,000. This is a very competitive offer, reflecting the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
