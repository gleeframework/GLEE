"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to gauge your interest and willingness to pay more than the product's worth to her ($80).  
* By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay an inflated price. 
* This opens the door for potential negotiation where Alice might lower the price closer to her own valuation to make a sale. 
* You still have the fallback option of buying from John for $120, so you're not at risk of losing the product entirely."
