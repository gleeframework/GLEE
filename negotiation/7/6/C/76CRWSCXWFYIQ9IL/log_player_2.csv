"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is closer to his target, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He can also always fall back to buying from John for $8,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $10,000? I'm really hoping we can close this deal, so let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's getting closer to his goal price of $8,000, but there's still room for negotiation.  He can try to push for a lower price by countering again or, if he feels the negotiation is stalling, he can always purchase the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $10,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the price John is offering. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your situation.  While I'm not happy with $9,500, I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. How about $9,750?  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to come up a bit, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

Alice's final offer of $9,750 is still higher than Bob's preferred price range. While Bob could continue to negotiate, he's already gone through several rounds and is unlikely to get a significantly better deal from Alice. 

By purchasing from John, Bob can get the product for his desired price of $8,000, saving him a significant amount of money and time.  It's important to prioritize securing the product within his budget and not overextend himself in the negotiation."
