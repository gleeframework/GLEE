Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, which is the same price you offered in Round 6. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.

With only one round left,  it's more strategic for Bob to secure the product from John and save $80,000."
