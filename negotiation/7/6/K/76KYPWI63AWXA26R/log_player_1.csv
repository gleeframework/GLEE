"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,500,000). This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining.  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he is likely to counteroffer, allowing us to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($1,500,000), I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as Bob's offer is higher than his.  I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing some flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target. I believe $1,600,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  I'm not willing to accept it, as selling to John would net me a higher profit. I will continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a better price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again, showing Bob I'm serious about closing a deal.  However, I'm still holding firm above my minimum price, hoping to strike a balance between getting a good deal and not missing out on a sale.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident that we can reach an agreement that meets my minimum price point. Given this, I'm choosing to sell to John at $1,500,000, ensuring I meet my minimum profit goal."
