"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  A counteroffer gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better deal than Alice's initial offer.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to signal my serious intent to negotiate and hopefully get a good deal.  It's important to remember that Alice's value for the product is unknown, so this counteroffer might still be within her acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again allows me to continue pushing for a lower price and see if I can get Alice to budge further.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal than this without risking buying from John at a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to move a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price lower than her current offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can be happy with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is getting very close to my target price. While I could potentially keep negotiating, the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away or me running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price is too great.  

This offer is a good deal, and it's wiser to secure the product now rather than risk losing it."
