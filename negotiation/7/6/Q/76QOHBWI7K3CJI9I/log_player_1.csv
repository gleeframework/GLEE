Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already had, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price than John is offering. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and existing interest, justifying the higher price without revealing your guaranteed offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price too high.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always propose a lower price, moving closer to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
