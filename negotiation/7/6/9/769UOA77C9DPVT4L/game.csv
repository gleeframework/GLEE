"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While the product sounds interesting,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $14,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go to $11,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above your last offer. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm firm on my offer of $11,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for such a unique product.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $11,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $12,250. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12250.0,Alice,7,
