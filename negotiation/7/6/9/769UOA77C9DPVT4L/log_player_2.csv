"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $15,000. It's a significant overpayment, so you should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While the product sounds interesting,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $14,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go to $11,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above your last offer. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$13,000 is still more than you are willing to pay, but you are getting close to your goal. Keep negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm firm on my offer of $11,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for such a unique product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $11,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $12,250. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $12,250 is only slightly above your maximum price. However, you have already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and there is no guarantee that Alice will accept your counteroffer. You are at risk of losing valuable time and potentially even exceeding your budget.  It is safer and more efficient to buy the product from John for $12,000."
