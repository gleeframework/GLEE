Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm willing to accept John's offer of $15,000 if Bob rejects it.
* **Why $20,000:**  It's a significant markup from my minimum value ($15,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. This makes it a potentially attractive offer to Bob while giving me some profit.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I force Bob to either negotiate or walk away. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential willingness to pay.  I'm prepared to drop the price if necessary, but my initial offer sets a strong starting point."
