Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $135 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum value of $150 and also below my starting offer of $135. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could accept and make a profit, I risk losing out on a better offer from John, who is willing to pay my minimum value.
* **Negotiation leverage:** I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, even if I need to make a few counteroffers. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my starting point, hopefully finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $135 to $120. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and highlighting the fairness of my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, allowing Bob to make another counteroffer if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've successfully negotiated a fair price and made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my options: 
    *  **Counteroffer again:**  I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk of going too low.
    * **Sell to John:** If I feel Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum value, I'll sell to John for $150 to ensure a guaranteed profit."
