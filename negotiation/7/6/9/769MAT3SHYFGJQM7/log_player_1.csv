"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly below what it's worth to me. This gives us room for negotiation, but also shows that I'm serious about selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12000.  Would you be willing to consider $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below what the product is worth to me, and we have 8 more rounds to try to get closer to my ideal price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more money, but I've come down a significant amount from my initial offer. This shows good faith and signals my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $13000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my desired price, we still have time to negotiate.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, and I'm hopeful that with a bit more back and forth, we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,250.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.  This shows I'm willing to compromise and that I'm eager to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $13000? It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob is now offering $13,000.  This is a good price for me, considering the value of the product to me and the fact that we only have 4 rounds left.  It's time to close the deal and accept Bob's offer."
