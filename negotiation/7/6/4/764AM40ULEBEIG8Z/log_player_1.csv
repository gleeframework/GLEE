Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $13,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the value the product will bring to Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $10,000 allows me to have a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
