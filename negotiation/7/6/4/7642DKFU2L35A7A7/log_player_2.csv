Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $700,000. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession: I'll include a 2-year warranty and a free maintenance package worth $20,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $700,000. However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in an additional $10,000 worth of customization to the product. This will make it even more tailored to your specific needs. The price remains at $700,000, and I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a unique product that meets your requirements.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on her price of $700,000. While it's above your target, she's now added significant extras:

* 2-year warranty
* $20,000 maintenance package
* $10,000 customization

These extras likely bridge a good part of the value gap, making this the best offer you're likely to get. Continuing to push might irritate Alice and risk losing the deal altogether."
