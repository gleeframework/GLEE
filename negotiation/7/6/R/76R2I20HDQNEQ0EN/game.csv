"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is simply outside my budget. Given the value you've described, I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
