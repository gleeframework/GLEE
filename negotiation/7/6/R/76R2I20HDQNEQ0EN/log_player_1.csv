Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is simply outside my budget. Given the value you've described, I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum price. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
