"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is still a good deal considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
