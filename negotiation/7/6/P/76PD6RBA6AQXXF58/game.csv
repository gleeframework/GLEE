"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1400000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1750000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
