Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer, but it gives me the potential to make a much larger profit. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but there's also a chance he values the product much higher and is willing to pay more.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Starting with a high offer gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  
* **Potential for a Win-Win:** If Bob accepts, we both benefit - he gets a valuable product, and I get a higher price than John's offer. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
