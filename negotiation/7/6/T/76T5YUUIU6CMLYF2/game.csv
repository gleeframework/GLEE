"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to get the price down to something closer to my budget.  How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
