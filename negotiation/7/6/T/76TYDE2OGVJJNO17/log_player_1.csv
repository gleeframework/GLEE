Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming for the highest possible price with Bob is the best strategy to maximize your profit. 
* **Leave No Money on the Table:** Starting at Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) would be leaving potential profit unexplored.  
* **Strong Opening Position:** Starting with a strong offer establishes a basis for negotiation if Bob counters. It allows you to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay above his perceived value."
