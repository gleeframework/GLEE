"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7500 is a little too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $8500? ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $7000 is simply not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least at $8000.  Let's find a compromise.",8000.0,Alice,5,
