Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,500 is a little too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for $7,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is simply not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least at $8,000.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
