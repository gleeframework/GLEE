"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the product is worth $500,000 to you, but I believe its value is much higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on a price, I may have to explore other options.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
