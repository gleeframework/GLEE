"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but there's still potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet halfway on this."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $1,550,000.  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is diminishing. It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with him, as I might not be able to secure my minimum price within the remaining rounds.

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial amount of money. While it would be ideal to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation is too high, and it's prudent to lock in the guaranteed $1,500,000."
