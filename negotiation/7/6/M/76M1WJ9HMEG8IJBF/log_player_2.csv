Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,300,000 and it's her final offer. Since you can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, it makes more financial sense to go with John."
