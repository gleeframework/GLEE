I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still too low for me, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price from him.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a secure deal and guarantees me a decent profit, even if it's not the maximum I could potentially get."
