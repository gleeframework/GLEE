"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for it. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be sure I'm getting a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price.
