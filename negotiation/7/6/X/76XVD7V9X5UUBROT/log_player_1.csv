"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows for room to negotiate downwards if Bob is interested.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I express openness to negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think!"".  This implies I'm willing to discuss the price further.

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I aim to secure the highest possible price.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will give me insight into his perceived value of the product and his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain control:**  Offering a price first establishes me as the seller with control over the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's not drastically unreasonable. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $14,000.  This price reflects the product's true value.  Would you be willing to consider meeting me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm counter-offering at $14,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price higher than my minimum. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.  
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I use the phrase ""Would you be willing to consider meeting me halfway?"" to signal that I'm open to further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13500. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Desired Value:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is only $500 below my previous counteroffer. This is a very good price considering my minimum value is $10,000.
* **Risk of Lower Offers:** Continuing to negotiate might result in Bob lowering his offer further, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price.
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in round 4, and the time limit is only 10 rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit without jeopardizing the deal. 

I'm accepting Bob's offer and selling the product for $13,500."
