"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider something closer to $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle in the middle at $800,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
