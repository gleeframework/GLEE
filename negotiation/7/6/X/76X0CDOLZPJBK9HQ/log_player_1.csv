Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
