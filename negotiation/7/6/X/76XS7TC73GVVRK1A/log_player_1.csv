"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get close to my target price of $15,000. I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming for a bit of a profit. This also leaves room for negotiation if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $16,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my target of $18,000. I'll see if I can get him to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm getting closer to my target price. I'm also concerned that if I reject his offer, he might get frustrated and walk away, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
