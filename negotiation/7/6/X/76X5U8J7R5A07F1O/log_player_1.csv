"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer above your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, and it establishes a strong initial position.
* **Acknowledging Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, both implicitly (""fantastic opportunity,"" ""truly special"") and explicitly (""given its value and potential""). This framing helps justify the high asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but comfortably above your minimum ($800,000). This suggests a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the asking price a little too high. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly lower than your target price and his perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and work towards a more favorable outcome. You have room to counter and still stay well above your safety net of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a fair deal. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the product's exceptional value while offering you a considerable return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  Starting the message by acknowledging Bob's offer shows you're taking his input seriously and seeking a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Standing Firm on Value:**  The message reiterates the product's high value (""significantly below its true worth,"" ""exceptional value"").  This emphasizes that substantial concessions aren't being made lightly.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a $100,000 decrease from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still a strong position above your minimum and encourages Bob to make a significant move if he wants the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair and attractive offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** You're making a $300,000 profit above your minimum selling price to John. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means you get the money sooner. Prolonged negotiations have a cost, and there's always a risk Bob could walk away. 
* **Strong Position:**  You've negotiated effectively and moved Bob significantly closer to your initial ask. Accepting this offer shows you're willing to make a deal when the price is right. 

While you could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, the risk of losing the deal and getting a lower offer in later rounds makes this a good point to accept."
