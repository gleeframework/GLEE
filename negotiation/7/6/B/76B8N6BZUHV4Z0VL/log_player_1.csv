Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
  ""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming for $15,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Justification of value:** By mentioning ""its value,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, making a higher price more palatable.
* **Exclusive opportunity:**  Framing it as a ""chance before anyone else"" could make Bob feel special and more inclined to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" signals that you're open to discussing the price, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable figure above $10,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob rejects the offer, but it maximizes your potential profit if he accepts."
