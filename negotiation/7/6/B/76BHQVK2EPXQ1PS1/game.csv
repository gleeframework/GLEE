"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. I think this is a great deal, considering the value it can bring to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7500 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,6,
