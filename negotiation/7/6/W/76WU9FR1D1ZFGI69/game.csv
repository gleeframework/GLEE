"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in trying to find a middle ground.  However, I need to be candid â€“ the value I place on this product is considerably higher than your current offer reflects. I'm willing to consider $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for us both. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
