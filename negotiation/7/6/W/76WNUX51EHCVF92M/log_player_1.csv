"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I believe this product offers significant value, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle on $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for us both. While your offer is better,  I'm still only able to offer $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum. Accepting his current offer would mean losing a significant amount compared to John's guaranteed offer."
