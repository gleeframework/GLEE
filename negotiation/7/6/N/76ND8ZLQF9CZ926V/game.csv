"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget of $120. Thank you for considering my request.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $105. This offers a compromise between our positions.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $105 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $112.50. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
