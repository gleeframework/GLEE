# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?
