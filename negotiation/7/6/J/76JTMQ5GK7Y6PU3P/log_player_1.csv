"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high benchmark and allows for potential negotiation.
* I am aiming to maximize my profit, but I am also considering the possibility that Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product if he values it highly. 
* I have 10 rounds to work with, so there is room to adjust my price if necessary.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
