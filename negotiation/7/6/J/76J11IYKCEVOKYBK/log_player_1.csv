Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still significantly better than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,500.  It's slightly higher than John's offer, and we're getting closer to my desired price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
