You can do better than $110.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save more money."

While $115 is better than $120 from John, you can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate further, $112.5 is a good deal and getting closer to your maximum price point. It's likely that Alice will not go lower, and you risk losing the opportunity to get this price."
