"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. You have 10 rounds to negotiate a better price, and John is always a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy it now.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget. You should continue negotiating, as you still have 7 rounds to try and secure a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $950,000, which reflects the product's value to me and allows us to close this deal.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget. You should continue negotiating, as you still have 5 rounds to try and secure a better price. Remember, John is always an option if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I need a price closer to my maximum.
