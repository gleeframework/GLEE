Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you don't want to sell to Bob for less. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still ensuring you make a significant profit.  
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" to justify the high price and encourage Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
