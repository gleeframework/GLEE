"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still get a good return on your investment.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This price is a good compromise, reflecting the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
