"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate, especially since Alice has already indicated she's open to it.  A counteroffer will give you a chance to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still get a good return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, I still think I can get a lower price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This price is a good compromise, reflecting the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and I'm close to my desired price. Accepting her offer at $1,075,000 is a good compromise and saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
