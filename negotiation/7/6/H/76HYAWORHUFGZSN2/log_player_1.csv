Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies that I'm open to discussing the price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $120 gives me confidence to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's interest in the product suggests there's room for negotiation.  I can likely get a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $120 is safe, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little to $130. That still gives me some margin, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price, but not by much, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to potentially increase his willingness to pay more.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm giving Bob an opportunity to counter again, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $115. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $115 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially with no guarantee of a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John offers $120, accepting Bob's offer is still a good deal, and saves me the trouble of finding another buyer."
