"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer positively to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving Room:** This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, without risking too much. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  I still have 8 rounds left, and Bob is clearly interested. There's room for a counteroffer that will hopefully lead to a better price. 
* **John is the Safety Net:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great price for the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this offer is still a good deal for Bob, even if it's not his ideal price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm still aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $12000 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Insistence:** Bob is sticking to his initial offer of $12,000, which is still too low for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:** While it's tempting to sell to John now, I still have 6 rounds left. I can continue negotiating with Bob, potentially finding a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance I can reach a higher price with Bob, but I'm also aware of the risk that we might not reach an agreement. John provides a safety net, but I want to maximize my profits if possible.

**Next Round Strategy:**

* I'll consider a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's $12,000 but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* I might try to emphasize the value of the product and its potential benefits to Bob, hoping to sway him towards a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This shows a genuine desire to compromise and reach a middle ground.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $12,500 is a good price for both of us, not just me.
* **Direct Question:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob still refuses, I will need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round.
* If Bob accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a price above his initial offer and achieved a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $12000 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is adamant about his $12,000 offer, and I've already tried compromising.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to 4 rounds left.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I might be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob, there's no guarantee. Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures a profitable outcome. 

**Conclusion:**  It's better to secure the $15,000 from John and avoid the potential for further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
