"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $950000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $950000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $920000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $920000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $980000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about the price. I'm willing to make one final offer of $960000. If this is still not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000, which is a much more attractive option for me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, but I need to be realistic about my budget. What do you think?",960000.0,Bob,6,
