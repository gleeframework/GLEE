"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. How about $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to give you another chance to close this deal, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $10,200? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
