Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $12,000 allows for potential counteroffers and a  negotiation process without immediately reaching my minimum price.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he recognizes the value of the product and is willing to negotiate. This indicates potential for a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore counteroffers and try to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me to accept. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still gives you a great value, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Higher than Bob's Offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a drastically low price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm still highlighting the value the product provides for Bob.
* **Compromise Language:**  ""Meet in the middle"" suggests I'm flexible and open to finding a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $10,000 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I am still looking to stay within my budget of $8,000. Could we possibly reach a compromise at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** Bob has firmly stated his maximum budget of $8,000, which is far below my minimum price of $15,000. Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, which ensures I maximize my profit. This is a far more advantageous option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take additional time and effort without a guarantee of a satisfactory outcome. 

Selling to John guarantees a significant profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
