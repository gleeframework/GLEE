"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you will be substantial.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, as I don't know Bob's value assessment. This sets a strong initial anchor.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the potential value the product has for Bob, encouraging him to consider its worth beyond just the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  ""Let's discuss"" indicates I'm open to negotiation, fostering a collaborative atmosphere. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to try and gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his counteroffer and how many rounds remain. I'll also be mindful of the $1,500,000 backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  There's room to negotiate higher. Bob is interested, and I have 8 rounds left.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for my minimum.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, leaving space for potential concessions but ensuring I don't lose out on significant value. I'll also consider Bob's initial statement about being ""interested"" in the product, indicating a potential to close the deal with a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I value your perspective, $1,400,000 is below the product's true worth. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,750,000.  This reflects a significant discount, and I believe it still provides you with a valuable investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and demonstrate flexibility by reducing my initial price. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I reiterate the product's true worth to emphasize it's still a good deal for Bob, even with the reduced price.
* **Compromise Language:**  ""Let's compromise"" encourages a collaborative approach and a win-win solution.
* **Maintain Margin:**  The $1,750,000 price is still above my minimum but leaves room for potential concessions in future rounds. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a fair price and keeping the negotiation moving forward. I've lowered my price to show flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway, but I've still maintained a margin above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will accept this compromise, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob has reduced his offer, he's still engaged and willing to negotiate. I have 6 rounds remaining.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations fail, selling to John is a guaranteed outcome.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counteroffer, but with a price point closer to my minimum to signal my commitment to getting a fair price. The goal is to find a middle ground that balances securing a high value for the product with a potential sale to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to secure the best deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it for $1,550,000. This is a firm price, considering the product's potential. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:** I emphasize that $1,550,000 is my firm price, showing I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's potential and value to justify my price.
* **Meeting halfway:** I've reduced my price further, showing I'm willing to compromise but not willing to go below my minimum.
* **Focus on fairness:** I frame the offer as a fair deal for both of us, fostering a collaborative spirit.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground that secures a price closer to my minimum, while leaving room for a potential concession in the next round if needed. I'm optimistic that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,250,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offers have been consistently low, he is still engaged and willing to negotiate. We have four rounds left.
* **John's offer is a safe fallback:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John and guarantee my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but also factor in the decreasing number of rounds.  I need to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and securing a deal before my window of negotiation closes."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're still discussing this. However, $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  With just a few rounds left, I'm willing to make a final concession. I'm offering it for $1,450,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal and get you the incredible benefits this product offers."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm emphasizing that this is a final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pressuring Bob to accept. 
* **Significant discount:**  I'm highlighting that this is a significant discount from my initial price, making the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Focus on benefits:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's benefits, hoping to re-emphasize its value and motivate him to accept. 
* **Time pressure:**  Mentioning the limited number of rounds remaining subtly increases the pressure on Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to try and close the deal.  It's a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept before the time runs out. If he rejects, I'll need to carefully consider whether to accept his next counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but $1450000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  We're down to two rounds left. 
* **John's offer guarantees my minimum:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in an even lower price.

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time and Bob's consistent resistance to my offers, it's wiser to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  While it's possible Bob might accept a slightly higher counteroffer in the next round, the risk of him rejecting and leaving me with no deal is too high.  The certainty of John's offer is the best option to maximize my profit at this point."
