"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about $1,000,000? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm still making a profit.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
