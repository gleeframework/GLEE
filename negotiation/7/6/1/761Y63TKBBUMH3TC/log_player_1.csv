"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is $825,000, which is lower than my initial offer, but higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($800,000). Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I think he's willing to pay a decent price.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $840,000.
