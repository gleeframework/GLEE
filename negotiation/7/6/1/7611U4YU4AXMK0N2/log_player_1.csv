Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This way, I maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects, I can always move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a good price for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
