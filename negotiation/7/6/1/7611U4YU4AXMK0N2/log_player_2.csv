"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget.  It's a reasonable compromise, and continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away or Bob losing the product to another buyer. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving $1,000 compared to Alice's initial price."
