{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate. It also opens the conversation with a friendly and inviting message, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at my minimum value, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price. I'll counteroffer and see how he reacts."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $15,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $16000? That way, we can both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum value, and it seems he's not going to budge much further.  It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
