Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and would like to counter your offer at $9,600. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired $12,000, $9,600 is a reasonable offer and I'm not sure I can get much more out of Bob.  I'm going to accept his offer and move on."
