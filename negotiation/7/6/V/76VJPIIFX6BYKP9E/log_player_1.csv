Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,100,000. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's valuation. This aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, I make a substantial profit.
2. **Provide Negotiation Room:**  There's space to negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, while still staying above my minimum.
3. **Maintain Leverage:**  I don't want to go too low initially and risk undervaluing the product, especially with John's offer as a safety net. 

By starting high, I increase my chances of securing the best possible deal."
