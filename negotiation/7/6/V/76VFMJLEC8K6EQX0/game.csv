"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a price that reflects its value to both of us. I'm asking for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to do business with you. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm still not able to accept that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and offers you a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
