Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he believes it's a good deal or if it solves a significant problem for him. 
* **Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's no risk of losing money by starting the negotiation higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might lower your starting price slightly. 
* **Product Demand:**  If the product is in high demand, you can afford to be more firm with your price."
