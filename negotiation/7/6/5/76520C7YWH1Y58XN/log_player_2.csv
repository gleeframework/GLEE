The product is worth $100 to me. Alice is asking for $150, which is far more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product, $100. This is the price I'm willing to pay, and anything more would be too expensive for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's price is still too high. I'm willing to pay $100, and John is offering it to me at that price. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm willing to go slightly higher than my initial offer, but I'm still hesitant to go above $105. This is a fair price that is closer to my value of the product and also lower than Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. Even though she lowered the price, it is still higher than what John is offering. I'll go with John's offer and buy the product for $100."
