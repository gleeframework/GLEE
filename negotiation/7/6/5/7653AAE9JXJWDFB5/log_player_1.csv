Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to me and lower than what John is offering. I have rounds to go and can try to get closer to my desired price."
