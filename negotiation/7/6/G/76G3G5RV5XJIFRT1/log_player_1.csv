"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is significant. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us to create a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer. 
* **Importance of the product:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer than his initial offer, I need to make sure I get at least $1,200,000 to meet my goals.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  I'm not desperate and can always go with the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John if the negotiation doesn't go my way.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still significantly below what the product is truly worth. Let's split the difference and meet at $950,000. This price reflects the value for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain my position:** I'm offering a slight concession ($50,000 more than Bob's offer) to show flexibility but still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's inherent value to emphasize why my price is justified.
* **Fairness and compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair solution that benefits both parties. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving room for another counteroffer from Bob, allowing for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $925,000 is still significantly less than the $1,200,000 I can get from John.
* **Time is on my side:** We're only halfway through the negotiation rounds. I can afford to keep pushing for a higher price.
* **Need to be assertive:** Bob is clearly trying to get the product for the lowest possible price. I need to be firm and stand my ground. 
* **Hope for a better offer:** Perhaps a counteroffer from me will push Bob closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still far from the value I need to get for this product. Let's be realistic - the product is worth significantly more than that. To show my commitment to making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our perspectives, and I hope you'll seriously consider it."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining my ground:** I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Show compromise:** While I'm not dropping my price drastically, I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a smaller concession.
* **Appealing to reason:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the need for a price that reflects that.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm suggesting that this is a ""final offer"" to encourage Bob to accept the deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $950,000 is still below my target price of $1,200,000.
* **We're getting closer:**  While we're still not at a point where I'm willing to accept, we are getting closer to a possible deal.
* **Time pressure:**  We're now in round 6, meaning time is running out.  I need to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better offer.
* **John is always an option:**  If Bob continues to refuse, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000.

I want to see if I can push Bob further with another counteroffer.  There's still a possibility he might come up to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. It's clear we're both serious about this deal, so let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $985,000. This reflects the value of the product and acknowledges your needs. Let's make this happen, Bob. It's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 985000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show continued flexibility:** I'm making another small concession to show I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting win-win:**  I'm emphasizing that this offer is beneficial for both of us, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept.
* **Time is running out:** We're in round 7, so I need to close the deal soon or risk losing to John.
* **Final offer approach:** I'm suggesting this is my final offer to pressure Bob to accept.

This offer is still above my minimum target price, but it's a reasonable compromise given the time constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $970,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John is a better option:**  I can get $1,200,000 from John, which is significantly higher than anything Bob has offered. 
* **No room for negotiation:** It's clear that Bob is not willing to budge much more.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob is not worth the risk of ending up with a lower price.

It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, especially since I'm running out of time."
