"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle soon.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
