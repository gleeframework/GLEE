"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's a significant difference between my asking price and my minimum, allowing for potential concessions. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see how Bob reacts. If he rejects, I'll lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I'll always be mindful of my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's a step in the right direction, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can potentially get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Risk of losing to John:**  While selling to John is always an option, I'm willing to take a calculated risk and continue negotiating with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground. If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll continue to adjust my offer until I reach a price that is both acceptable to me and that I believe Bob is likely to accept. However, I'll also keep a close eye on the number of rounds remaining and the potential of selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I can come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to get a valuable product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum but still lower than my initial offer.  
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing mutual benefit and the opportunity to close the deal.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair price for both parties.
* **Urgency:**  By saying ""Let's close this deal!"", I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without explicitly mentioning the alternative (selling to John).

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a compromise that allows me to get closer to my desired price while keeping the deal with Bob on the table. By being flexible and communicating positively, I hope to reach an agreement before the negotiation deadline or before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's getting closer, it's still not at a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I've already made significant concessions, and there's a chance Bob could go a bit higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations, believing I can get closer to my target price. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm not yet ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, countering his offer with a slightly higher price in the next round. I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John, but I'm confident that I can secure a more favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $935,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that is closer to Bob's latest offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive, emphasizing finding a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm reiterating the importance of reaching an agreement, subtly hinting at the time constraint.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  While still below my minimum, this offer represents a significant move towards Bob's position.

**Strategy:**

By making a smaller concession, I'm hoping to entice Bob into accepting the offer. I'm confident that this price is still high enough to be a good deal for me, while also being within the realm of reason for Bob. The goal is to strike a balance between my financial goals and the likelihood of closing the deal before the deadline or resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'd like to propose a 2% discount on top of that. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and Bob is still refusing to budge significantly on his price. 
* **Discount Proposal:** Bob's offer, while seemingly a ""discount"", is a gimmick. A 2% discount on $925,000 is only $18,500, which is a small amount in this context.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate.  His counteroffers are getting increasingly minor.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirement.

**Strategy:**

While it's frustrating that I'm not getting closer to my ideal price with Bob, it's more important to secure a profitable deal. Selling to John guarantees a safe and profitable outcome. It's a calculated risk to walk away from the negotiation with Bob, but the time constraint and the lack of significant progress make it the most sensible option."
