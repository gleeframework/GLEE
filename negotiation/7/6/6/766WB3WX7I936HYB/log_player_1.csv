Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's John's guaranteed purchase price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially earning me even more.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $150 right away might discourage Bob, even if it's worth more to me. The slightly lower price makes it seem like a better deal for him. 

This strategy balances maximizing my potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
