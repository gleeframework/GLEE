Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $145. This price is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's also attractive to Bob, as it's below the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm countering Bob's offer with $140. This price is still below the product's value to him, but it's also closer to my initial offer and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $135. While I'd prefer my initial asking price, this offer is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and a better deal than selling to John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
