Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the offer as a great deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'd be getting. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being rigid, but encouraging Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product for a price that's close to my goal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **If negotiations stall:**  I'll consider selling to John for $10,000 to avoid losing potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,200 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $10,000 is an option, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while acknowledging Bob's interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,200 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a good price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,200). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm re-emphasizing the value Bob will get for the product at this price, hoping to encourage him to accept.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product for a price that's within my desired range.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider selling to John for $10,000, as the negotiations with Bob seem to be stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited negotiation room:** Bob's counteroffer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. There's limited room for further negotiation, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process and lead to a loss of potential earnings. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $10,000 provides a quick and guaranteed sale, securing my desired price.

**Next steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale."
