Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum value.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for less."
