"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $750,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting close. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $740,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",740000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $740,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $730,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase if we can agree on this price.",730000.0,Bob,6,
