Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. To be candid, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000.  If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm confident we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to go beyond his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000).  Continuing the negotiation would likely result in a lower final price, and potentially waste valuable time.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
