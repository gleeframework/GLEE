"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only go up to $10000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and your willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can close a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal. If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you are trying to close the deal, but $14500 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $13000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. I am hoping we can reach a final agreement this round.",13000.0,Bob,6,
