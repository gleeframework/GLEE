"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique piece that's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only go up to $10000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and your willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can close a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'll also consider selling to John if Bob doesn't come up significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal. If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you are trying to close the deal, but $14500 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $13000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. I am hoping we can reach a final agreement this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $13,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm going to sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000. It's a safer bet than risking further negotiation with Bob."
