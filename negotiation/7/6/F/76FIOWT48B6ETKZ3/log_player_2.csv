You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you can do better. You have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless she comes down further. There's a chance she'll offer a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
