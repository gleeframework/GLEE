"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for you at $1,000,000. I understand its significance and would like to offer it to you at an exclusive price of $950,000. This is a special opportunity to secure this remarkable item at a price that is still significantly above market value. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). Bob can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, even though it means paying the full $1,000,000. This ensures that Bob gets the product while still leaving some room for negotiation with John in the future."
