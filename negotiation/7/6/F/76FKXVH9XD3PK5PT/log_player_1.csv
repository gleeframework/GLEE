"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'd like to start the conversation by offering it to you for $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  A high initial offer sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. Even if this price is far from Bob's expectation, it gives us room to negotiate downwards and still achieve a price significantly higher than our minimum. 
* **Confident Demeanor:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and conveys confidence in its worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the phrasing indicates a willingness to have a discussion and explore options. 

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this would mean a substantial loss for us.  We know Bob is willing to pay at least $1,200,000, so we have room to negotiate.  We'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the substantial benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We're lowering our price by $300,000, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, we're still aiming high to provide room for further negotiation.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying a higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The phrasing ""find a middle ground""  frames the negotiation as a collaborative effort, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to our minimum price, but we're still in a strong position. His offer of $1,150,000 is only $50,000 below our guaranteed sale price with John.  We'll reject this offer to signal that we're not desperate and see if we can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber and potential. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** We're only lowering our price by $100,000 this round, applying a bit of pressure and signaling that we're reaching the higher end of our acceptable range.
* **Focusing on Value:** The message emphasizes the product's future potential and long-term benefits, subtly shifting focus away from the immediate price. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, we aim to keep Bob engaged and prevent him from going too low in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down a bit more for this to work for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting too close to our fallback option with John.  While we might be able to negotiate Bob up a bit more, it's becoming risky. 

* **Opportunity Cost:**  We're entering a zone where each round spent negotiating with Bob potentially costs us money compared to the guaranteed sale with John.
* **Limited Upside:** It's unlikely Bob will suddenly agree to a price significantly closer to our desired range. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a safe and immediate $1,200,000.

It's more profitable at this point to take the guaranteed deal with John."
