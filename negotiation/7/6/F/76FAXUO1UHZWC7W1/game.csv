"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly appealing, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. Would you consider $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the immense value this product offers.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
