I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while allowing you to acquire it at a reasonable cost. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

I'm going to try to get a better price from Alice. It's worth it to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate down to closer to my $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's above your cost.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
