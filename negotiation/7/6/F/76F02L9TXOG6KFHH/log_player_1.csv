Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit more.  $15,000 is my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $17,500? This would still give you a great deal, and it would help me achieve a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}

Round 4

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's more than what John is offering. I'm going to accept it and close the deal."
