Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. However, it's important to see if Bob is even remotely interested at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it right away. He's essentially trying to get the product for the bare minimum, and I want to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a profit margin. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking. While I could counter again, I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. John is offering my minimum price, and it's time to cut my losses and move on."
