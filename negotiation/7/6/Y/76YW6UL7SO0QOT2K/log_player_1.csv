"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 
I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I believe $11,000 is a fair price, considering the value to Bob.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than selling to John, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

I'm going to drop my price a bit further, to $10,500. This is still above what John is offering, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob is finally willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, I've already rejected his previous offers and we're running out of rounds.  Selling to Bob for $10,000 is still better than selling to John for the same price, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
