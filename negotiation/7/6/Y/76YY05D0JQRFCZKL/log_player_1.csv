Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, the value of this product is far greater than your offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of what you're getting."", 
""product_price"": 925000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $925,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to go up to $825,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below the product's value to Alice and John's offer. It's worth pushing a bit more to see if we can get closer to at least $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $825,000 is still significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a considerable return on your investment.  My final offer is $875,000. This is a firm price."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While it's less than ideal, we are running out of rounds, and Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $850,000 is a better outcome than risking no deal with Bob and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer later or having to settle for John's $1,000,000."
