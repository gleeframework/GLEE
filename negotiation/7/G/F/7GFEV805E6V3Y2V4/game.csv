"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
