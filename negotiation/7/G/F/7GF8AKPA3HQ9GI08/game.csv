"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know its value to you is substantial, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this stage. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with a fair deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
