Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know its value to you is substantial, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this stage. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is very close to my desired price point and is within my budget.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price."
