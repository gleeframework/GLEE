"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob wants to save money and Alice's offer is too high.  Rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $135 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  He can get the product from John for $150, so accepting Alice's offer at $165 would be worse.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $165 is still a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $145? I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $160? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob is trying to save money, and while Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what John is offering. To get the best deal, Bob should buy from John."
