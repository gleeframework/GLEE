Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000.  I believe I can leverage the value of the product and the limited rounds to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Considering the true value of this product and its potential impact on your business, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This price is still fair, reflecting the value you'll gain while allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  We've already established a range between $900,000 and $1,050,000.  I'm confident I can find a compromise closer to $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.

Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
