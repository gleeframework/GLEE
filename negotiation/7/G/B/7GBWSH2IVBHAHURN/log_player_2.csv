"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a better price than $95, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
