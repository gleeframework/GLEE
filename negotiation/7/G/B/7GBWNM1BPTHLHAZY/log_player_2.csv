"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000).  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair, considering its value to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  It's still above her value of $800,000, so she's making a profit, and it's lower than Bob's initial budget of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal for both sides."
