"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget considerations, however, $11,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Could you do $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $13,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
