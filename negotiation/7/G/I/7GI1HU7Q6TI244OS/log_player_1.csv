"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm briefly highlighting the value of the product to make it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure the highest possible price. I'm starting high, but I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll be keeping an eye on the number of rounds remaining and the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $100.  While it's tempting to accept quickly, it's too low a price for me.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  I still have 8 rounds left, so there is time to negotiate. I'll keep in mind John's offer of $100 as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate that $90 is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll get from the product.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering at $90, I aim to bridge the gap between our positions.  If Bob rejects again, I'll continue to adjust my offers, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $100 and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both have a price in mind, Alice. How about we settle at $75? It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum desired value of $100.  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for that low a price yet.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate. I have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to reject this offer and counter with a higher price. I'll keep monitoring the situation and consider selling to John if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing $85 as a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we can finally close the deal at this price.

**Strategy:**

This is a crucial round. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. If he rejects again, I might need to consider selling to John, as I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk ending up with a price too low.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my offer and finally agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up to $78, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are now in round 6, with only 4 rounds left.
* **Unlikely Compromise:** Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum desired value of $100. There's a high chance that continued negotiation will not lead to a price I'm happy with.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $100, which is a better outcome than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John rather than risking a lower price with Bob in the remaining rounds. Selling to John now guarantees I reach my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of ending up with an unfavorable outcome."
