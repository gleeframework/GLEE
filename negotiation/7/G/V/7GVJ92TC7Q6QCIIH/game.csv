"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
