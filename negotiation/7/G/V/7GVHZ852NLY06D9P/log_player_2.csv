"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than her initial value of $12,000, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You are better off rejecting this offer and going with your alternative option."
