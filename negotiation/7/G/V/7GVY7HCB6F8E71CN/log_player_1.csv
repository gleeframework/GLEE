Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. That's still a great price for a product that's worth $15000 to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a compromise. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go below $14,000.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and we're still pretty far apart. I'm starting to think that it's not worth the risk of going through more rounds and potentially getting a lower price.  John is offering me my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
