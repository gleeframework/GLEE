Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still a significant profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you could potentially settle somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:** Emphasize the product's value to Bob. If he understands its potential, he might be more willing to pay a price closer to your asking price.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  A lot depends on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating tactics."
