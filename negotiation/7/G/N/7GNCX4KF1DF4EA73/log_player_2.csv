"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you at $1200000. We hope this aligns well with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he knows he can get the product for $800,000 from John.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in your product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. Based on your feedback, we're prepared to consider a higher price than initially offered. We propose to sell the product to you for $950000. We believe this offers a fair compromise between our valuation and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high for Bob. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. My final offer is $875,000. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
