"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. This is a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than my minimum value ($120) but still higher than Bob's valuation ($80). This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully entices Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $120. While I'm eager to make a sale, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm offering a price that is closer to my minimum value while still being somewhat appealing to Bob.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92.50 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $88.50. This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to sell at a price that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us much closer to an agreement.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price to show flexibility while still staying above my minimum value.  This should hopefully entice Bob to accept, but if not, we can keep negotiating."
