"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92.50 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $88.50. This would be a good deal for both of us.",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us much closer to an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",90.0,Alice,5,
