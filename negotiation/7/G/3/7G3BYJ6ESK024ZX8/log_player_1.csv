Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000.  This offer reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. I believe this price reflects a good balance between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting at $1,025,000 is a good deal.  It's considerably more than Bob initially wanted to pay and keeps us from dragging the negotiation out further and risking no deal at all."
