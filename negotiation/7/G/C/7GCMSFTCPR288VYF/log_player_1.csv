"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price, even though it's above Bob's known valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I signal my willingness to negotiate and hear Bob's perspective.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts, I secure a great deal.
2. **Establish a Strong Position:** Even if he rejects it, I set a high anchor point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value of the product. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. 

By rejecting and countering, I aim to:

* **Continue the Negotiation:**  I want to see how much further Bob is willing to go. 
* **Maintain Pressure:** Rejecting shows I'm serious about getting a strong price.

I'm not yet ready to sell to John for my minimum ($1,200,000) because I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the value in this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,650,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $150,000, which is a significant amount but keeps me well above Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains firmness.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the price as a balance between the product's value and Bob's interest, aiming to appeal to both logic and emotion.
* **Middle Ground:** By proposing $1,650,000, I'm aiming for a price point closer to the middle of our previous offers, encouraging Bob to move closer to my range.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  I'm signaling flexibility without conceding too much.
2. **Test Bob's Limit:**  This offer will help me gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. Can we find a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating his interest in the product. However, $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 

I believe there's more room for negotiation:

* **Bob's Pattern:** He's consistently moving towards the middle ground, suggesting he might be willing to go higher.
* **Time Remaining:** We're only on round 4 of 10. I have time to counter and explore his willingness to pay more.

While selling to John is always an option, I want to exhaust my negotiation options with Bob before settling for my minimum price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. It seems we're getting closer. How about we settle on a price of $1,500,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and meets you closer to your price range."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making a smaller concession this round ($150,000), signaling that I'm getting closer to my bottom line. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that this offer is a ""significant discount"" to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $1,500,000 is exactly halfway between our last two offers, reinforcing the idea of compromise.

This offer aims to:

1. **Maintain Momentum:**  I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward without giving up too much ground.
2. **Encourage Bob's Final Offer:** This price might prompt Bob to make his final, best offer, hopefully above my $1,200,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is continuing to negotiate, his offer increments are getting smaller. His latest offer of $1,350,000 is still below my $1,200,000 minimum.  

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Limited Upside Potential:**  Bob's negotiation pattern suggests he's unlikely to meet my minimum price. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of lower offers and wasted time, while John offers a guaranteed price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 secures my minimum acceptable profit.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed deal from John."
