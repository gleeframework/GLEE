"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7000 is simply too low for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500?  It's a fair price considering its value. ",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $8000? That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to buy it from you instead of John.",8000.0,Bob,4,
