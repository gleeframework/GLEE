Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find really valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit lower. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** The $100 price ensures you make a profit above your $80 minimum even if Bob negotiates down slightly.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob."
