Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it slightly below my backup price ($150) might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and could encourage him to accept. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Starting too low (e.g., $100) could insult Bob or make him think the product isn't valuable.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
