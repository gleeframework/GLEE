"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $9800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $9800 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9200. Can you meet me at that price?",9200.0,Bob,6,
