"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 12000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I think I can still get a better price, so I'll counter again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a good middle ground here. I'm willing to go down a little further to $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to save a bit more. I'd be willing to pay $10,750 for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I've been pushing for a higher price, but with only two rounds left, I'm risking getting stuck with the lower price from John. $10,750 is still a good deal for me, and it's better than settling for John's offer."
