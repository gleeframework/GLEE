I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This price is above my minimum of $10,000 and leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a good deal for Bob considering he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is close to my minimum and a significant improvement over his previous offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  I'll accept his offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or having to sell to John."
