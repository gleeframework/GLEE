"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be valuable to you.  My asking price is $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob without revealing my true minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's interest shows there's room for further negotiation.  I'm not willing to sell at his price yet, but I'm open to exploring a compromise.
* **Potential for better price:**  I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the need for a reasonable profit while still offering a good deal to Bob.
* **Maintain a profitable price:** $160 is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't sell at a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob is showing interest and flexibility. There's still room for a counteroffer that could get us closer to a mutually beneficial price.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** However, I want to exhaust all negotiation possibilities with Bob before resorting to John's offer. If the next round doesn't lead to a better deal, I might choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $150, which is my absolute minimum. This is a great price for a product of this quality. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer,  I'm going down to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a ""great price"" and urging Bob to close the deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price. 

This strategy aims to put pressure on Bob to accept the offer before I resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob's offer of $130 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  It's clear that we are too far apart in our expectations.
* **Time is running out:**  We've already had five rounds of negotiation, and I only have five rounds left. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John at $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.

At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.  There's no guarantee he'll come up in price, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John is the most sensible and profitable choice."
