"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit of $200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I want to establish a strong starting point and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could take the $950,000, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000, which is still a significant profit for me.  This should show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I want to see if I can push for a bit more. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm not willing to go much lower. This should encourage him to make a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While we're getting closer to a deal, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1 million. It's time to show Bob that I'm serious and won't be bullied into a bad deal.  I'm going to stick to my guns and see if he'll finally meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm sticking with my minimum price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and Bob's willingness to buy it. I'm confident that he will finally accept this offer, but if he rejects it again, I'll be forced to go with John's offer."
