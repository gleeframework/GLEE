"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, but still allows for potential profit.  By starting high and being willing to negotiate, I can explore what Bob is willing to pay while leaving room for myself to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and see if I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $8,500 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum value of $12,000, it's still significantly lower.  I have 6 rounds remaining and can continue to negotiate with Bob.  There's a chance he might be willing to go higher, and I can also explore a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  $9,000 is my final offer.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last discussion, so how about $8,875? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,875 is getting closer to my minimum value, I still have 4 rounds left. I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my desired value.  I want to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go down to $8,950, but that's my absolute final offer.  If you want this product, I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8950}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,950 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, which is the lowest I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll make it worth your while. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, and while we're getting closer to a deal, we're still far apart.  With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to get a price that I'm happy with.  Selling the product to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
