Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. I'll be prepared to accept a lower price if necessary, but I'll also be willing to walk away and sell to John for $8,000 if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still leaving room for a profitable transaction for me. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not high enough for me to feel comfortable.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $8,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob that could lead to a lower price."
