"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $11,000? This is still a great value for you, considering the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $9,800? That's the lowest I can go.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still unfortunately below my minimum.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price, and it allows me to make a profit while still providing you with a great deal. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,
