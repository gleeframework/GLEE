Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. However, I'm also aware that he might reject this offer. If he does, I'll be prepared to negotiate further or sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum price, I'd like to try and get a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $165. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, I'm happy to get $160 for the product.  It's a bit more than selling to John, and I'm not sure how many more rounds of negotiation I'm willing to go through."
