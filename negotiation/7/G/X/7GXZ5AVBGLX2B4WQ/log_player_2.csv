{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough. While Alice is showing some willingness to compromise, her offers are still above your target price.  It's becoming increasingly likely that you won't be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it's prudent to secure the product from John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing you the desired price and avoiding the risk of a potential stalemate with Alice."
