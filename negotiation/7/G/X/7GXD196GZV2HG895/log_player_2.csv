"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $950,000. 
* **There is room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  John's price is your maximum, so you should only go to him if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** Starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer shows your intention to negotiate aggressively and demonstrates the value you see in the product.
* **Still within your budget:** While this offer is significantly lower, it's still within your budget of $1,500,000, leaving room for compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and understand her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.**  While $850,000 is still higher than your ideal price, it's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to your maximum.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate might risk pushing her to hold firm or even increase her price.
* **Avoid the higher price from John:**  Buying from John would cost you significantly more. 

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer minimizes your risk of losing a good deal and ensures you acquire the product within your budget."
