"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I need a price that makes sense for me too. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. We're aiming for the highest possible profit, and accepting $950,000 now would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  $950,000 isn't feasible, but I'm ready to make this work.  Would you consider $1,150,000?  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach an agreement."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's try to wrap this up quickly.  Would you be willing to settle at $1,000,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:** Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. While we might have been able to push for a slightly higher amount, there's always the risk he could walk away. Accepting $1,000,000 ensures a significant profit and a successful deal."
