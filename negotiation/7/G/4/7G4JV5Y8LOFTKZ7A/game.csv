"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $10200 is still a little too low for me. Given the value of this product, I believe $10500 is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
