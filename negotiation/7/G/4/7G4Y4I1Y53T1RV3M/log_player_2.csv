"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive offer tailored to your needs and could be the perfect opportunity for you to maximize the benefits this product has to offer. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or finalizing the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than what you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or sticking with your backup plan of buying from John."
