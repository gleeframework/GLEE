Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,350,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer instead of forcing me to sell to John at my minimum price."
