Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too far off, to see if I can get a good deal. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $120?  It's my top limit, and I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure the sale now."
