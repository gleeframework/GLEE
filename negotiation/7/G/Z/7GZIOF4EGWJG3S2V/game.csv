"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,500,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $1,850,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $1,850,000. My maximum offer remains at $1,500,000. I hope this helps move us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
