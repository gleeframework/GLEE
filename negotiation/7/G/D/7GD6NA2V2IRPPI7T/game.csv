"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but we're still not quite there.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product to me.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $950,000, which is $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
