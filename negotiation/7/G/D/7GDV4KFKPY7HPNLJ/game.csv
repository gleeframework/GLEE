"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, I believe it's worth more than $150. Considering its value, I'm offering it to you for $120. I hope this price aligns with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $120. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value and the market rate.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $105. This is a price that takes into account both the value of the product and the market rate, while also being slightly more aligned with my initial offer. I hope this proposal works for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $92.50 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I am willing to consider $95 as the final price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product and the current market conditions. I hope this offer meets your expectations and we can proceed with the transaction.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. This is my last counteroffer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",92.0,Bob,6,
