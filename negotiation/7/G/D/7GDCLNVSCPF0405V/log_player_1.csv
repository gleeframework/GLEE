"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob. $85 is still a good deal for him and I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $90 is the best deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more from Bob, $82.50 is getting very close to my minimum. At this point, I'm better off selling to John for $80 and avoiding any further negotiations."
