"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of its worth. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,500,000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, the product's value remains high for me. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000.  This reflects my seriousness about finding the right buyer for the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your proposal carefully and while I'm grateful for the reduction, I'm still not able to meet the price at $1,350,000. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
