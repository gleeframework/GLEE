"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to maximize my profit.  While $18,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it gives him room to negotiate and hopefully reach a deal that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a decent offer, I'm holding out for more. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. I'm also still within the 10-round limit and haven't exhausted all my options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway, hoping he sees that it's a fair compromise.  $16,000 is still above Bob's perceived value, but closer to the value I'm seeking.  I believe this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a slightly higher price.  I'll counteroffer again, and if we don't reach an agreement, selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm going to make one final push for a price closer to my desired value.  $15,500 is a good compromise, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept it, especially since we're nearing the halfway point in our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too low for me. I'm not confident I can get a better price with further negotiation. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
