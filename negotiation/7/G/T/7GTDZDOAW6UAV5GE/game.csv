"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $12,000. However, to make a deal, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $10,500. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,600, which is closer to my maximum.  It's a fair offer, considering you're still getting more than John's price.",10600.0,Bob,4,
