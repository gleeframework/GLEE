"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for this product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again - how about $15,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I was hoping we could go a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your final offer.  However, $14,000 is still just below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite there, Alice. I'm willing to pay $14,000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. If we can meet at $14,000, I'll consider it a fair deal. Let's see if we can make it happen.",14000.0,Bob,8,
