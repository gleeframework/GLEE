Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again - how about $15,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your final offer.  However, $14,000 is still just below my minimum.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not quite there, Alice. I'm willing to pay $14,000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. If we can meet at $14,000, I'll consider it a fair deal. Let's see if we can make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not convinced I can get Bob to budge from $14,000. I've already rejected his offer twice, and I'm concerned that further counteroffers will only drag the process out. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum of $15,000, I'm going to sell the product to him. It's a sure thing, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal with John."
