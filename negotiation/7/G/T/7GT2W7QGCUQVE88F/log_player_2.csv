"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, I think you'll really like it! Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, allowing you to save more."
