"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet you halfway from my previous offer of $10,000, which would put the price at $9,500? This way, I can still make a decent profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
