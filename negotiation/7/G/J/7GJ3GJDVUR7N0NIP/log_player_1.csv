Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.  
* **My minimum:** I want to make at least $10,000, as that's what I can get from John.
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $11,500 is a fair compromise. It's a significant price reduction from Bob's value, giving him a good deal. It also guarantees me a profit of $1,500, which is better than selling to John.

This approach increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a good price for me."
