Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase [Product Description] for a price that I believe will be mutually beneficial.  While I can't disclose the exact value to you, I can assure you it's worth significantly more than $800,000 to me.  I'm confident this product has the potential to be extremely valuable to you, but ultimately, the decision is yours.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I've tried to strike a balance between emphasizing the value without being overly specific. I want to pique Bob's interest and make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Product Price:** I'm offering a price higher than John's offer, but not too high to scare Bob off.  By stating a specific price, I'm initiating a negotiation and showing confidence in the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response.** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll move on to selling to John.
* **If Bob wants to negotiate:** I'll be prepared to counter based on how interested he seems and his potential value for the product."
