"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about $9,000? That's a fair price and closer to what I had in mind.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I think you'll really benefit from owning this product, and I'm willing to make a small concession to get the deal done.",9500.0,Alice,5,
