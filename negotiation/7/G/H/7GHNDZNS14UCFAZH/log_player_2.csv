Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think it's a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you halfway at $110, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $105, and I'll throw in some additional perks to make it worth your while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
