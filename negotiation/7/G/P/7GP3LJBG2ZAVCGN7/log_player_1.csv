Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum price. This means a deal is impossible unless Bob is willing to pay more than he thinks it's worth (unlikely) or you accept less than your guaranteed amount.

**The Offer**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer, it's in your best interest to offer a price to Bob that's slightly above his maximum value, knowing he'll likely reject it. This allows you to move on to John without wasting time. 

Here's the offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Why this Approach Works**

* **Anchoring:** By starting with a price above Bob's maximum, you anchor the negotiation higher. While he'll likely reject it, it sets a starting point that favors you.
* **Time Efficiency:**  You quickly move on to John who is a guaranteed sale at your desired price. 
* **Potential Upside:** There's a small chance Bob might be desperate or misjudged the product's value to him, leading to an unexpected acceptance.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you've accurately assessed John's willingness to buy at $1,500,000. If there's any doubt about John's commitment, you might need to reconsider your approach."
