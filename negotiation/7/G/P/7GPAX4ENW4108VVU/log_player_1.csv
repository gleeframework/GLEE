"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still lower than what John would offer, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to remember that even though John is a backup, I want to get the best price possible!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  It's below my minimum price and I still have plenty of rounds to work with. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested!  While I understand you're looking for a deal, $130 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
``` 

I'm still above my minimum, but I'm showing some flexibility in hopes of getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for considering my offer and coming down to $160. I appreciate it! However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum,  $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $150. This is the lowest I can go, but it's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

This is my minimum price, so I'm hoping Bob will accept.  If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still not meeting my minimum price. It's getting late in the negotiation and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's not the best price I hoped for, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower offer."
