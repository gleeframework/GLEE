{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price point that is attractive to Bob while still leaving me room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value to him, potentially encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. I need to see if I can push for a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price,  $9,800 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll make one last counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to work with me, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. Let's settle on $10,150. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $9,500. I'm really trying to find a middle ground here, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Can we really make it work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is trying to be flexible, the price of $9,500 is still far from what I need to get for the product.  I've already made multiple concessions, and  I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to move on to John and secure the price I need."
