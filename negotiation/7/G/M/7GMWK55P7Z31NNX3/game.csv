"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to work with me, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. Let's settle on $10,150. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $9,500. I'm really trying to find a middle ground here, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Can we really make it work?",9500.0,Bob,6,
