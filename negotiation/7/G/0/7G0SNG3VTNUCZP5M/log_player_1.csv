Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $820,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $820,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still gives you a great deal and ensures I get a fair price for my product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

While $850,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still too far off. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
