Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This gives Bob a chance to accept, but also sets the tone that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $120. While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. John is offering my desired price, and I'd rather secure a sale at that point than continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting stuck with a lower price."
