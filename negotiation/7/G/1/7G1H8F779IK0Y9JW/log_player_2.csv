"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1200000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my asking price while still allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's value to me. I'm confident you'll find this offer highly attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but it's a bit too low for me. While I want to reach an agreement, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for the product. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still provides a good value for you while allowing me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While it is a significant reduction from her initial offer, Bob should continue to negotiate. There is still room to come closer to his budget, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best option."

Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm also committed to ensuring a fair price for my product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement. Remember, I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000, so time is of the essence. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While it's closer than before, continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort. 

Given that Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000, it's the most logical decision to accept John's offer. It guarantees Bob the product at the best possible price within his budget."
