"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $10,500 is still above what I can afford. Let's try $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and the potential for a long-term relationship.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer you the product for $10,200. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and my initial offer. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,200 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really pushing the limits here, but I can go up to $9,500. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm confident it will be a win-win for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're pushing the limits, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, and I can offer you the product for $9,800. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and my initial offer. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $9,800 is still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to make a final offer.  I can go up to $9,600.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and the time we've spent negotiating.  If we can agree on this, I believe it will be a mutually beneficial outcome.",9600.0,Bob,8,
