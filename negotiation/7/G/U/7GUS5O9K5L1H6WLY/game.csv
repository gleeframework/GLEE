"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
