"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
