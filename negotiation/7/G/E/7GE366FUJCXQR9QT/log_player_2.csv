"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You should buy from John.  While $11,500 is closer to your ideal price, it's still more than John's offer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when you have a guaranteed lower price from John."
