"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, as a compromise.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm really looking for a fair price for this product, and I think $110 is reasonable for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $108 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle at $109?  I think this is a fair price considering the quality of the product. It's a win-win for both of us.",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'll meet you at $108.50, but that's my final offer. Can you accept that?",108.5,Bob,8,
