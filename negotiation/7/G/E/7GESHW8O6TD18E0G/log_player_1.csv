"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for a high-quality item.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not desperate for a quick sale, so I'll try to negotiate further with Bob.  There are still rounds left to potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, as a compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $120 unless I have to. I'm confident I can get a better price with more rounds of negotiation. There are still rounds left to potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm really looking for a fair price for this product, and I think $110 is reasonable for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $108 is still below what I want. There are still 4 rounds remaining and I'm willing to try to reach a compromise with Bob, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable option for a sale at my minimum. I'm not going to accept a price that is significantly lower than my minimum unless there is no chance of getting a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but $108 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle at $109?  I think this is a fair price considering the quality of the product. It's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'll meet you at $108.50, but that's my final offer. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round where I can still reach a deal with Bob. At this point, I'm very close to my minimum price, but $108.50 is still below what I want. Additionally, John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob, as there is a risk of not reaching an agreement or further lowering my price."
