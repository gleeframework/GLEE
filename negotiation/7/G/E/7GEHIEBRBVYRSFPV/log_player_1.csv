Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also confident that I can get at least $15,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is still too low for me, especially since I know I can get $15,000 from John.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still gives me a decent profit while potentially getting me closer to a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale at a good price, so I'm going to take that option."
