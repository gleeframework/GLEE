Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong position.  You can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the ""incredible value and potential"" to justify the high asking price. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number ($1,500,000), you anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you don't have much information about Bob's negotiating style. If you knew he was very price-sensitive, you might adjust your approach.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive opening price might be preferable."
