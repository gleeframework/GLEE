"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I do see the value in the product,  $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum price of $10,000.  Since John is offering the product at Bob's limit, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
