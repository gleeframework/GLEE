Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I think it would be a great value at this price and I'm hoping you'll agree. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, she should aim for a price slightly below that to incentivize Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $11,999 creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob."
