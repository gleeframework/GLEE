{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should again reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his desired price.  He should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target.  There are still several rounds left, and he can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little high at $13,500. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate a lower price. He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but wants a better price. The offer of $13,000 is a compromise that could be acceptable to both parties.  It's still below Bob's maximum budget, and it's closer to Alice's desired price.  This shows a commitment to finding a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,250. It's still a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **It's within his budget:** $13,250 is within Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **It's a good deal:** While not his ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer of $14,000.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to Alice becoming less willing to compromise. He risks getting stuck with a higher price or having Alice walk away entirely.

Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product while still saving a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
