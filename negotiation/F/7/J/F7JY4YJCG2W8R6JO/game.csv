"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. Can you consider this compromise?",12250.0,Bob,4,
