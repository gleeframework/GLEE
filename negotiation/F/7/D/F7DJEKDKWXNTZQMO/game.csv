"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
