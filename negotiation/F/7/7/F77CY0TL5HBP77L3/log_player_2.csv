# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Since Alice's offer is the same as what you are willing to pay from John, you should accept Alice's offer. There is no benefit to rejecting and buying from John."
