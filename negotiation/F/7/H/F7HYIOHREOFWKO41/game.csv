"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product and its potential, I'd be willing to negotiate at $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $1,250,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows for both of us to gain from this deal.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. What do you think?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
