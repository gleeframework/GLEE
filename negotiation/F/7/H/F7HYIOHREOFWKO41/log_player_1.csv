{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential value. My asking price is $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief justification for the price helps establish a basis for the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  While $1,400,000 is below my minimum, it's a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will reveal his willingness to negotiate and provide insight into his perceived value of the product.
* **Maintain a fallback option:**  The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There is still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Value of continued negotiation:** The possibility of getting a better price than Bob's offer justifies continuing the negotiation. 
* **Maintaining a fallback option:**  Having the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me.
