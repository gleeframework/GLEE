Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product and its potential, I'd be willing to negotiate at $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.
