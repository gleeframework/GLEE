"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1300000} 

I'm going to start with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me. This gives me some room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is serious about purchasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before accepting. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $1,250,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my desired price point and a good middle ground. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my price."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I have several rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1220000} 
```

I'm going to make another counteroffer, this time lowering my price to $1,220,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully prompts him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still going to reject it. I believe I can push for a higher price and potentially reach a deal closer to my desired $1,200,000 mark. I'm not desperate to sell right now, and I have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1210000} 
```

I'm going to make another counteroffer, this time lowering my price to $1,210,000. This is a small decrease from my previous offer but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and hopefully prompts Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Finally, Bob has offered my minimum price of $1,200,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that I could end up with a lower price or that Bob will walk away entirely. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
