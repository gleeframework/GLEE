Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

This is a starting point. Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'm offering it at a price that is still profitable, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he rejects, I'm ready to counter.  John's offer of $120 is a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $120 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $105. This is still a profitable price for me, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince Bob to accept.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I want to avoid pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is pushing for a price that is significantly lower than what I consider fair. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of driving Bob away is increasing, and I'm not comfortable lowering the price further.  John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so it's the best option for me at this moment."
