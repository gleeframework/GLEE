"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal that benefits us both. Let's talk!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and it's a significant concession from my initial offer of $1,100,000.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is closer, but it's still not quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This would allow me to meet my minimum price while still giving you a fair deal.  Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're close, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about $1,225,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and it's a significant concession from my initial offer of $1,100,000.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,225,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit short of my desired price point.  To bridge the gap, how about we settle on $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward with this deal.  Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're close, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $1,200,000 or lower. How about $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
