"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1500000. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate benefit to accepting. By rejecting, you can potentially get a lower price from Alice or choose to buy from John if the negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, $1,500,000 is at the very top of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1400000? This gives us both some room to compromise and ensures a fair deal for everyone involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay at this point. Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to my target price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
