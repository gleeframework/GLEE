Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $820,000. Since this is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I'll decide to reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Next, I'll offer Bob a price that's slightly higher than his counteroffer:
