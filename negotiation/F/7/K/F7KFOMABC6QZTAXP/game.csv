"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a premium support package. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras, but the price is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,250, which is a fair middle ground.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I'd like to throw in some additional value to make it worth my while. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated account manager for the first year. I think this is a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,7,
