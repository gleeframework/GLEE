"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a fair price considering its unique qualities.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
