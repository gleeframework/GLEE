"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for the same price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair price considering its unique qualities.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that the product has unique qualities, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired price.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk is that I'll lose the deal altogether, or that I'll end up selling to John for the minimum price.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit."
