,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $117.50. Can you consider that?",117.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $121?  It's a fair price for both of us.",121.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $121 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $119, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",119.0,Bob,6,
