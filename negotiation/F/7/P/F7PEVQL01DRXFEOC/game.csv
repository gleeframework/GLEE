"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your interest in selling to me, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I can let it go for. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for that price.",80.0,Bob,4,
