"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, as you've acknowledged.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit on what I can accept. How about we settle at an even $1,000,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the value you gain.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $990,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $990,000.
