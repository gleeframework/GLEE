# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a great opportunity to get an incredible deal on a product that's worth $1500000 to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1300000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm counteroffering at $1315000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the value it holds for you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,315,000 is still above Bob's budget of $1,200,000.  While there's a possibility Alice might come down further, it's unlikely she'll drop to Bob's desired price. It's at this point that the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential savings.  It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase from John at $1,200,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
