"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1250000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1325000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1325000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my current financial situation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1300000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm counteroffering at $1315000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1315000.0,Alice,5,
