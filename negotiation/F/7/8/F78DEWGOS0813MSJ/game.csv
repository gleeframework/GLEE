"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.  I'm willing to offer you $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement here.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
