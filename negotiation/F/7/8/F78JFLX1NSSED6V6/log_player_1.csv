While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, the increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer beyond this point. Accepting his current offer would mean a loss of $115,000 compared to John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
