"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11500 is a bit closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
