"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth a lot to you, and I think this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
