"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
