"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $850,000 is still too low for me. I'll counteroffer to Bob to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation is getting repetitive, and Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, I'm not comfortable going any lower.  I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. This ensures I at least get my minimum desired price and avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation."
