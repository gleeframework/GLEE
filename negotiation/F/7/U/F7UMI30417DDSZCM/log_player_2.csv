"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a good starting point. You can get the product for less than $1,200,000 from Alice, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $950000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

You're still in a good position to negotiate. Alice has moved closer to your price, but there's still room to get a better deal.  Let's try another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm now offering it to you for $925000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can shake on this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a good price considering you're aiming for under $1,200,000. It's a good deal, so accepting it is the best option at this point."
