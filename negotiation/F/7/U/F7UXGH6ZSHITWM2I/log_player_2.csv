# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm going to try to push for a lower price in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of buying from John for $1,200,000 if this negotiation doesn't go well."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
