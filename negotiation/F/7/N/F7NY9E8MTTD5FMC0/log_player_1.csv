Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than half of my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counter-offering with $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me and is closer to my minimum acceptable price, hopefully encouraging Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm dropping the price slightly to $1,100,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping my price above my minimum acceptable value. I believe this might encourage Bob to raise his offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is taking too long.  I'm going to sell to John and secure the $1,200,000.  While it's not as high as I initially hoped, it's still a good profit and guarantees a sale."
