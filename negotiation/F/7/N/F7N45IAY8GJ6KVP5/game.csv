"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $100. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too much for me. How about $90? I'm really serious about buying this, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $95. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
