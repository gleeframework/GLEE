{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good starting point, it's still above my target price. I want to try to negotiate further with Alice to see if I can get a lower price.  There are 9 rounds left, so there's time to explore options."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm also trying to secure a good deal.  I'm aiming to get a price as close as possible to my maximum, leaving a comfortable buffer."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is good, but I still want to see if I can push for a lower price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's still a significant gap between Alice's offer and my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility. However, I'm still keeping the price below my maximum limit, as I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway.  This offer demonstrates my continued interest in buying while also trying to get a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation, hoping that we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  I have five rounds left, and I'm confident that I can still get a better deal than $1,090,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm inching closer to Alice's offer with this counteroffer. My goal is to find a midpoint that's acceptable to both of us. With just a few rounds left, I want to avoid delaying the deal further.  I believe this counteroffer is a good compromise and could be the final step towards reaching an agreement."
