Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I've got a great product for you that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $120, which is a good middle ground between my minimum price and what I know Bob values the product at. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and open to negotiation, hoping to encourage Bob to counter-offer instead of rejecting outright.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** A starting price of $120 leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good profit margin.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** Being open and friendly makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  By inviting counter-offers, I maintain control and can adjust my price based on Bob's interest.

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he becomes too stubborn, I can always fall back on selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is more than my minimum price of $80, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get a better price.  By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I maintain control and can potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $100? That would still leave a bit of wiggle room for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $100, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm staying positive and friendly, acknowledging Bob's offer while highlighting the value I'm bringing to the table.

By making a counteroffer, I'm:

* **Maintaining control:** I'm setting the terms of the negotiation and keeping the conversation moving forward.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer lets me see how much further Bob is willing to go.
* **Still aiming for a good profit:**  $100 is significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, ensuring I still make a decent profit.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to assess the situation again. If he becomes too inflexible, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is close to my desired price point.  While I'd love to squeeze out a few more dollars, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  

* **Profit:** $95 is a decent profit margin, considering my minimum price is $80.
* **Risk vs Reward:**  Further negotiation could result in a higher price, but it also risks Bob getting frustrated and walking away.  Accepting his offer minimizes risk while still securing a good profit.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to close the deal and avoid the potential for further negotiation, which could lead to a less desirable outcome."
