"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
