Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his maximum budget.  He has a few options:

* **Negotiate further:** He can try to get a lower price from Alice.
* **Buy from John:**  This is the most likely option since John offers the product at his maximum budget."
