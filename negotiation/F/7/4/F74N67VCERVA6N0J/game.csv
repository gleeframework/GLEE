"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that will bring you great value. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $11,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'll meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000. I can offer you the product for $13,500. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  I can't go any higher than $12,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
