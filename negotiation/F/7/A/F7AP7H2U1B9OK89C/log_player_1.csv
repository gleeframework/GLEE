Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It sets a strong starting point:**  You're not giving away the farm, but you're also showing you're open to negotiation. 

Now, let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below the value of the product to Bob.  There's room for a counteroffer to get closer to your goal of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'd be willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $950,000 isn't ideal, it's still a significant amount and above your minimum.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing him as a buyer and having to settle for John's lower offer. Accepting his offer ensures you secure a sale and a decent profit."
