"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,050,000 is below its true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its value. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000.  This price is more in line with my budget and allows for some room to make this deal work for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,090,000.  This price is closer to my ideal range and should allow us to close this deal.  What are your thoughts?",1090000.0,Bob,6,
