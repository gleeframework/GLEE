"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's tempting to accept, he can likely get a better price.  He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and the starting price is still above his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,050,000 is below its true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While she has lowered the price, it's still above his desired price point. He has room to negotiate further and can try to push for a lower price. Buying from John is still a viable option, but he should exhaust negotiation with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000.  This price is more in line with my budget and allows for some room to make this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While she is coming down in price, she's still not at a point that is ideal for Bob. He can try to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,090,000.  This price is closer to my ideal range and should allow us to close this deal.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1090000}
