Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) might make him feel like he can lowball Alice in a counter-offer.
* **Secure a Deal:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so she doesn't want to go below that.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
