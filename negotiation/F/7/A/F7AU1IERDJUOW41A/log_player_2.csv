"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $145. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $145 is closer to her valuation, you can get a better deal from John for $120.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
