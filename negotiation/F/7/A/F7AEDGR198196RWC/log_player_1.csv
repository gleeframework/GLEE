"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's my minimum price and I'm hoping to get more. I'm going to counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still higher than my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and I've already had three rounds of negotiations.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid potentially losing out on a deal altogether."
