Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his final offer is still below John's standing offer. It's unlikely Bob will go higher than $9,900, and further negotiation might sour the deal. Taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John is the most logical choice at this point."
