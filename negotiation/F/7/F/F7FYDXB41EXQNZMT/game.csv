"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. How about $10,000? That seems fair considering its value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering its value and the effort I put into creating it.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range. How about we settle at $11,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we make it $11,500 and we have a deal?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,250. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,7,
