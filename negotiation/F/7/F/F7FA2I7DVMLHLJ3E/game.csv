"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $700,000? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $700,000 is still a little bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $600,000? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $650,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",650000.0,Alice,5,
