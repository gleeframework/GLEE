,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000.  This is a fair compromise and still leaves you with a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $900000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal. While $900000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get a great value from this product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1000000 is a bit high. I'll try to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,6,
