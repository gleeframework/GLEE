"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price, especially since she values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $13,500? I believe that's a fair price considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $14,000?  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum:**  $14,000 is only $500 more than Bob's maximum price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer could lead to more rounds of negotiation, but there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  There's a risk that Alice might counteroffer with a price closer to $14,500.
* **Time and effort:**  Continued negotiation takes time and effort.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product quickly.

While Bob could potentially get a slightly better price, the risk of further negotiation isn't worth it given the small difference in price."
