Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,500 is higher than your minimum price of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer without you having to significantly drop your price.
* **It's a strong initial offer:**  It shows you're confident in the value of your product but are open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $13,500? I believe that's a fair price considering your value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below what you initially aimed for. You can likely secure a better price by making a counteroffer.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a more favorable deal."
