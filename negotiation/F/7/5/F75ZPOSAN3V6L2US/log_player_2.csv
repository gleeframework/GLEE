"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer and sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to get this product at a discount, and I believe it's a deal you won't want to pass up. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point,  it's still above my ideal price. I want to save as much as possible. By rejecting the offer, I can start a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a decent compromise.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, going back and forth could risk her going back to her original price or even losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John."
