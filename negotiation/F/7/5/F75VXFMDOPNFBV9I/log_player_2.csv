"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's fair for both parties. $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
