Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It also reinforces the perceived value of the product. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at broader value and exclusivity (""before I list it publicly""), subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he seems hesitant, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below your minimum of $15,000."
