"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm prepared to pay up to $1000000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $1200000? It's still a good price for a product with the potential yours has.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
