Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  Hopefully, this will be appealing enough for him to accept, but still allows me to gain a profit above my minimum."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's a significant improvement over his first offer and only $500 below my counteroffer.  It's also $1,000 more than selling to John, making it a more profitable option.  I'm willing to take this deal to avoid potentially further negotiation and the risk of ending up with less."
