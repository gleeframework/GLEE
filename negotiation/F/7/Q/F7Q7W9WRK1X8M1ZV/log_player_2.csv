"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* Buying from John immediately would cost Bob $1,200,000, so it's not the best option.
* Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible, but also wants to close the deal.
* Offering $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. 
* This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also firm on his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000.
* Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product and save money compared to buying from John. 
* While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially reaching a point where the deal falls through is higher than the potential savings.
*  The potential savings from further negotiation may not be significant enough to justify the risk."
