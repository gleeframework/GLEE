Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on this. I can do $10,100, but that's my absolute bottom line.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and I need a decision now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $10,100 secures a savings of $1,900 compared to John's offer and is a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might backfire."
