I'm starting with a high price of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals my confidence in the product's worth. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and be willing to negotiate upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer but significantly closer to his valuation. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. It's a risk to keep negotiating as I'm losing time and there's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my minimum.  John is offering my minimum, and I'm confident that I can find a better deal in the future if I need to.  I'll sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
