"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.  There's room for negotiation.
* **It's worth exploring a counteroffer.**  You could potentially get the product for less than $9,500.
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can still get the product, but it will cost you more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product.  However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It shows you're serious about buying but are also pushing for a good deal.
* **Message conveys a friendly tone:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, making it less likely to be rejected outright.
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation:** If Alice rejects this offer, you have room to increase your offer slightly, but you've already established a price point that is favorable to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price reflects the product's value while still acknowledging your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's a compromise, $9,000 is still above your ideal price point.  You want to try to get it closer to your $8,500 offer.
* **Further negotiation is possible.**  Alice has already shown a willingness to move on price, and you have room to counter without going over your maximum.
* **Buying from John is still the fallback.** You're not desperate to buy from Alice, so you can afford to keep negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference at $8,750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
