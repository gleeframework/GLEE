Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth at least $20,000, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go higher and risking a lower offer from him isn't worth the $500 difference between his offer and John's sure deal.
