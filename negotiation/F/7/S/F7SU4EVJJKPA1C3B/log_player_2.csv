Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,250 is a good compromise.  While you might be able to squeeze out another few hundred dollars, you're already very close to your ideal price, and the negotiation process can be time-consuming.  Accepting Alice's offer saves time and ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
