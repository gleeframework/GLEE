"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential of this product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has tremendous value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 remains out of my price range.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can only go up to $900,000. This price would allow for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand that this is a significant investment for you.  While I'm still seeking a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This offer reflects my desire to close the deal while acknowledging the value this product holds.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we settle on $925,000? This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  You clearly see the value in this product, and I respect your negotiation skills.  Let's aim for a win-win situation. How about $950,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth and allows you to gain a significant asset.",950000.0,Alice,7,
