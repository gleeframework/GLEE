"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a better price than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay from John. This should open up negotiation without immediately being too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to my target price, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to get closer to $90, so I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $95. This is still a good deal for Alice, considering she values the product at $150, and it keeps the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $105 is getting closer to my goal, but I'm getting impatient. It's likely that I'm not going to be able to get much lower than $100 with Alice, and I don't want to risk going back and forth much longer. At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John for $80."
