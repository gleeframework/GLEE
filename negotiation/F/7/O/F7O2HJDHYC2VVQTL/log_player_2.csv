"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
 ""product_price"": 65
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much wiggle room there is. This leaves plenty of space for negotiation while still staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still significantly above our ideal price. We'll counter again and see if we can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a good compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're getting closer. This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and our previous one, signaling that we're willing to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but I can't go lower than $85.  This product is worth a lot to me, and I believe $85 is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While still slightly above our ideal price, getting the product for $85 is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely."
