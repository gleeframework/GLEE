"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in [product name], $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  There's a lot of value in [product name] that I believe justifies a higher price point. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 is closer, it's still above what I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $1,850,000 for [product name]. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let's close the deal.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Let's try to wrap this up. How about $1,925,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us given the product's value.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,875,000. This would represent a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction.",1875000.0,Bob,6,
