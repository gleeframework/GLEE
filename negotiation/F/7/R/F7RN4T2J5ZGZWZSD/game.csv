"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1000000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950000? This would allow me to make a fair purchase without exceeding my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $975000?  This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your latest offer, and while I appreciate the compromise, I'm still not able to commit to $975000. I believe we can find a price closer to $960000 that would work for both of us. I hope this suggestion allows us to move forward towards a mutually satisfactory agreement.",960000.0,Bob,4,
