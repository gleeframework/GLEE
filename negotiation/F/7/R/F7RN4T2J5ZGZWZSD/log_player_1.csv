Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1000000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950000? This would allow me to make a fair purchase without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your latest offer, and while I appreciate the compromise, I'm still not able to commit to $975000. I believe we can find a price closer to $960000 that would work for both of us. I hope this suggestion allows us to move forward towards a mutually satisfactory agreement.
