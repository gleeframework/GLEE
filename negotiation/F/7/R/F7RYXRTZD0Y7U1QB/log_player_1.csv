Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good deal.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further.  However, I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the deal doesn't seem worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $80.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price.  If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $85 is still a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price John is willing to pay.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation since I'm not going to get a better price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell him the product."
