Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""unique value"" aims to pique Bob's interest and justify the higher price, even though you haven't explicitly revealed what makes it so valuable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating a mutually agreeable deal. 

By starting with a higher offer, Alice can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price significantly higher than his perceived value of $8,000. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice still has the security of John's offer at $10,000."
