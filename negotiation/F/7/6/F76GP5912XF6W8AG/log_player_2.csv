"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $700,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a new price of $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.
