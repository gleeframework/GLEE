"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1450000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1450000.0,Bob,2,
