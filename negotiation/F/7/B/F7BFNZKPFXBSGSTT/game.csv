"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,225,000 is closer, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you consider $1,125,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,125,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
