Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with my highest possible price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's still a good deal for him.  If he rejects it, I'll have to consider how much I want to negotiate and how much time I want to invest in doing so."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial price, but it's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offers are still too low for me.  Negotiations are taking more time than I'm comfortable with, and I'm confident I can get my full price from John. It's time to move on and sell to him."
