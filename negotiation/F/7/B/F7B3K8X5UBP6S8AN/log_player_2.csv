"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so you should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance you can get it for less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This still leaves you a good profit margin, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what Bob would pay to John, and it gives Bob a profit margin of $2,000 ($12,000 - $10,000).  There's no guarantee that Bob can get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and it could risk losing the deal altogether."
