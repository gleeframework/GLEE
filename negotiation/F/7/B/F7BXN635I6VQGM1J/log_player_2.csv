"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true worth of its capabilities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to immediately buy from John, as there's potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his $10,000 limit as possible.  He starts by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering the value of the product.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's interest while also establishing a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a bit high, but $12,000 undervalues what this product can do for you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. He's aiming to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a more favorable deal. There's still room for negotiation, and buying from John right now would be a missed opportunity to potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get great value from this product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 limit. He's moved closer to Alice's offer but is still offering a price lower than her last offer. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while still sticking to his budget. The message also emphasizes the value Bob sees in the product, making it more appealing to Alice."
