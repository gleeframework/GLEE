Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, potentially justifying the high price in his mind.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to counter, initiating the negotiation process.

It's important to note that while John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer.  There's room for further negotiation.  By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we're looking for a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't justify going as low as $1,400,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Counteroffer:**  By acknowledging Bob's offer, we maintain a positive tone and show we're open to negotiation.
* **Holding Firm on Value:** We reiterate the product's value to justify our position and avoid appearing overly eager to drop the price.
* **Compromise:** Offering a price of $1,500,000 is a significant compromise from our initial offer while still leaving room for potential profit beyond John's offer. 
* **Clear Call to Action:** Asking ""Would you be willing..."" directly prompts Bob for a response and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, I cannot meet the $1,500,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 if that is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,300,000 is getting too close to John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of:

* **Further Price Reductions:** Bob might be unwilling to go much higher, leaving little room for profit beyond John's offer.
* **Stalled Negotiations:** Prolonged back-and-forth could waste time and potentially lead to a deadlock.

Selling to John now secures the guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a strong outcome and avoids the risks of further negotiation with Bob."
