"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't justify going as low as $1,400,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
