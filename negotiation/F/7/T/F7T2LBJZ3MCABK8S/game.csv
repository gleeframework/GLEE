"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'd like to offer $750000. This reflects my understanding of the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my initial offer. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $800000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you at the lowest price I'm willing to sell for, which is $850000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
