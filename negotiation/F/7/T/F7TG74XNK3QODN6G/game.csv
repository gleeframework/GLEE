"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While that price is decent, I'm hoping to find something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about we try $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
