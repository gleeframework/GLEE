"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would still give you a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference again and go with $1,275,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
