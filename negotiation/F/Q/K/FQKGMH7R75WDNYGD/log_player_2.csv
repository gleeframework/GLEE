You should reject Alice's offer. It's above your maximum price point, and you have a better alternative in John.  You can use this to your advantage in the negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value you see in the product and your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $11,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a fair return for us.

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still above your maximum. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you know John will sell you the product for $10,000. It's better to avoid further negotiation and get the best possible price right away."
