"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you consider that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. Can you consider that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm not willing to budge any further, and I think it's time to re-evaluate our conversation. I'm going to make one final offer, and it's $1150000. This is my last chance to sell to you, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
