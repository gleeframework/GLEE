Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I've chosen a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and potential for a higher sale price. 
* **Encourage Bob to counteroffer:**  A counteroffer from Bob gives me more information about his willingness to pay and allows for a more strategic negotiation.
* **Maintain a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to accept $105, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially reaching a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway between my initial offer ($115) and his offer ($105).
* **Fair price justification:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to justify my counteroffer. This helps frame the price in a way that's more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise if Bob's still not willing to pay $110."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 again? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've been persistent in my negotiation, but it seems Bob is firm on his budget.  To ensure I don't lose out on potential profit, selling to John for $120 is the most sensible decision. It guarantees I reach my minimum goal and avoids further negotiation that may not yield a better outcome."
