"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $7,500. This is a special opportunity to secure such a valuable item at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, she might be willing to come down slightly to make the sale. By rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer, Bob can try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product. However, I'm working with a tight budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer aims to test Alice's willingness to negotiate. By offering significantly less ($6,500), Bob provides room for potential compromise while still leaving a chance for Alice to make a profit. This strategy allows Bob to gauge Alice's flexibility and determine his next move in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your budget constraints, I am unable to match your proposed price. However, I would like to extend a counteroffer of $7,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down in price, and further haggling might not be worth the potential savings.  Securing the product at $7,000 is a solid deal, saving Bob $1,000 compared to John's offer."
