Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $119."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($119) creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains $19 in value ($119 price vs. $100 value) and you maximize your profit beyond the $120 guarantee. 

Let me know Bob's response!"
