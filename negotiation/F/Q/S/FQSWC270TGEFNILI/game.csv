"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $95 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Could you do $75? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $90 for the product. This is already a very competitive price. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $90 is still a little too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $78. That's a firm offer. Let me know if that works for you.",78.0,Bob,6,
