"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $95 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Could you do $75? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $90 for the product. This is already a very competitive price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $90 is still a little too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $78. That's a firm offer. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to go above his ""firm offer"" of $78. Since you have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, it makes more sense to sell it to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
