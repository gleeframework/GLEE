"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to consider $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $105. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $115. This is a good compromise, and it's still within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet at $125? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This way, you still make a profit, and I can stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,7,
