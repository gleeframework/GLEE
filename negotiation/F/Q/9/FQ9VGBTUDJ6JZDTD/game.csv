"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $95. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the counteroffer.  While I see the value in the product, $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92.
