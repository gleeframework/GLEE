"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $155 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $145?  I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to compromise again and sell it to you for $152. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",152.0,Alice,5,
