Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.  If Bob rejects this, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my price, but still holding out for a value higher than my minimum. This should show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is above my minimum value and quite close to what I'm hoping for. While I could potentially get a bit more with further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees me a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of continuing the negotiation."
