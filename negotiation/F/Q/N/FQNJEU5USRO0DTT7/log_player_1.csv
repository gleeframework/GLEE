Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we want to start with a price closer to our minimum ($150). There's a chance Bob might accept a higher price, especially if he doesn't know we have another buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $120, we leave some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's really interested, but still well above his perceived value. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, we can always fall back on John, who is willing to pay our minimum acceptable price."
