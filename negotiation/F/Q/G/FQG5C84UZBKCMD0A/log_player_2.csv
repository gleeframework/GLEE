"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $1,200,000 for this exceptional item. I understand its value to you is higher, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.
