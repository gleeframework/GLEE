"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $22,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $12,500? This is a fair offer considering your need to sell and my budget constraints.",12500.0,Bob,6,
