,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1350000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go up to $1200000. If you're willing to come down to that price, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
