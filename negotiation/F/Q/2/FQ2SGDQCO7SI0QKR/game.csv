"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000? This would allow us both to reach a reasonable compromise. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
