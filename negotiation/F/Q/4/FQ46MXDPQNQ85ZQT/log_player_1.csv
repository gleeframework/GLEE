Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Initial Price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value without explicitly mentioning your bottom line. This encourages Bob to engage and potentially reveal how interested he truly is. 
* **Potential for Profit Maximization:** If Bob accepts the $19,000 offer, you maximize your profit. If he rejects it, you can always fall back on your deal with John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a small chance of Bob rejecting the offer and having to sell to John."
