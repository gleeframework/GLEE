{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already getting more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  You're not asking for the full $12,000 right away, which makes you seem reasonable.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is a decent amount, it's still less than your initial offer of $11,500. You're willing to negotiate, but you're not going to accept the first counteroffer. You have room to bargain a bit more, especially since Bob is interested and expressed he thinks the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000,  It's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm sticking with a price closer to my initial offer since Bob showed a willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a compromise that still leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants.  It also demonstrates that you're confident in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $10200 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has dropped his offer again, and we are now at a point where selling to John is the most financially sensible option.  While Bob is still interested, his counteroffers are getting too close to John's offer, and it's not worth risking further negotiation for a small gain.  It's time to move on and secure the $10,000 with John."
