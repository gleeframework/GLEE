"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John, but still above Bob's desired price point.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice. By offering $12,500, Bob is offering a price that is slightly more than what the product is worth to Alice, while still staying within his budget. This counteroffer might be attractive to Alice, as she could still make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  It's only slightly better than John's price. Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. While John is always an option, Bob should prioritize getting a lower price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and his budget is $15,000. He's already offered $12,500 and been rejected. This counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise, offering Alice a decent profit while remaining within Bob's budget. This is a good middle ground to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,250 is the best price she's offered so far.  It's still slightly higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's lower than John's price.  Bob should accept the offer to save money, considering the negotiation has gone back and forth several times.  There's a risk of further counteroffers leading to higher prices, so accepting this offer is a good compromise."
