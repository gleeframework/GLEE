Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know it's worth a lot more to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be agreeable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is tempting, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter again, but I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,000,000?  It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
