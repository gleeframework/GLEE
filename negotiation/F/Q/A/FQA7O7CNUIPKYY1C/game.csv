"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13500 for the product. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13500 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14000. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $12000, which would be $13000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really trying to find a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $13200? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $12800? That's as close as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to compromise further. If you're not willing to meet me at $13000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $13000. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
