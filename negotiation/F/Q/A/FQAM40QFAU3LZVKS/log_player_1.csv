Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $135. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:**  Offering the product at $135 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Bob's value, but below John's:** This price targets a point where Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than he values it, but you still secure a profit above your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message aims to be friendly and open to discussion, allowing you to assess how interested Bob really is. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving a safety net (selling to John) if Bob rejects the offer."
