"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, the price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about we meet at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $950,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $950,000 is just too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. How about $1,200,000?  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
