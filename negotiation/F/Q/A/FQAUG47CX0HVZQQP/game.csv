"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our current negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still not able to meet at $11,500. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.",11000.0,Bob,4,
