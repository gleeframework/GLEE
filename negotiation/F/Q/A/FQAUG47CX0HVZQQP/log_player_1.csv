Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Openness:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, which might make Bob more likely to engage.
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm if Bob gets too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our current negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I still have leverage with John's offer of $15,000. I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, there's a chance I could get closer to that amount with further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining my profit margin.
* **Highlighting the deal:** I'm emphasizing that this is still a good deal for Bob, making him more likely to consider it.
* **Remaining firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate further, $11,500 is my lowest acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still not able to meet at $11,500. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $4,000 below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing John:**  If I reject Bob's offer and try to counter, there's a chance I won't be able to reach a better price, and I could lose John as a buyer.
* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting this offer allows me to make a profit and keeps the door open for future interactions with Bob. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting $11,000 seems like the most reasonable choice considering the risks and potential future benefits."
