Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not sure I can go much lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying from John for that price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $10500. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is getting closer, but it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,500 is still beyond my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's my final offer before I have to consider John's offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to $11000. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has only come down $250 from her last offer. We're running out of rounds, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to a price you're comfortable with.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer."
