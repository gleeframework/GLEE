"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not sure I can go much lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10500.  This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying from John for that price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $10500. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11500 is still beyond my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $11000? That's my final offer before I have to consider John's offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
