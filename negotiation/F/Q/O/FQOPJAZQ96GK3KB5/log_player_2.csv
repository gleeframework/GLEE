"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
