{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that John is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I will reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $125, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is higher than his initial offer and is only slightly below my minimum price. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
