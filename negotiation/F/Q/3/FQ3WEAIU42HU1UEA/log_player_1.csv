{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's value for the product, but leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers. It's important to start high and see if Bob is willing to meet you in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $150?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is offering your minimum value for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, so accepting his offer is the best option."
