"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $175 is well above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  He can do better by counter-offering or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $125 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate lower or buy from John for a guaranteed $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While $115 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  He knows he can get the product from John for $100, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
