"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
