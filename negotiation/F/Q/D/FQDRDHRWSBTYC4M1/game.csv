"Thank you for offering your product! While I recognize its value, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $60. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $100 is still a little bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $75? I think that's a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but I need to be upfront with you.  My absolute maximum budget for this is $80. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a limited budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $80, as it's below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'll make a bit more than my minimum price.",105.0,Alice,7,
