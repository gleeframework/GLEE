Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential need for the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a margin above my minimum acceptable value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still below my initial target, it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's value for the product and the risk of further negotiation. It's also higher than my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John would only give me a marginal increase in profit."
