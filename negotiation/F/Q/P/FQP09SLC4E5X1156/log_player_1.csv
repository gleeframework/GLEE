"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I can always come down if needed. This allows me to potentially maximize my profit, while also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also framing the message positively, highlighting the product's potential value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $7000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. I understand it's a lot of money, but the product is truly unique and worth the investment. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and go with $8250.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get a good return on this investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum threshold of $8,000 and it's a fair compromise.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on this good deal."
