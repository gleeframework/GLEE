"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $7000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. I understand it's a lot of money, but the product is truly unique and worth the investment. I'm willing to come down to $8500.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and go with $8250.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get a good return on this investment.",8250.0,Bob,4,
