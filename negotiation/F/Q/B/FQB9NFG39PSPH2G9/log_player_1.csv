Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $12,000 leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a good starting point. 
* **Knowing Bob's value:** Since I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I aim for a price that allows for a compromise but still yields a profit for me.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'm confident I can get a better price, as he's clearly interested in the product and willing to pay more than John.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be a safe option, but I'd prefer to try to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would still be a great price for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to get a fair price as well.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob to remind him that my price is still competitive despite the compromise.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:**  This offer allows me to earn more than John's offer of $10,000, keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions and a lower final price. 
* **Potential for future business:**  Accepting Bob's offer fosters a positive relationship and opens the possibility of future business dealings with him."
