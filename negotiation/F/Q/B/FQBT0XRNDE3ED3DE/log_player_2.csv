"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is closer to his budget than John's price, he can still try to negotiate further with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price that is more favorable to him."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget with each round of negotiation. While he could continue to try and negotiate a lower price, the risk is that Alice will reject his offer and he will have to buy from John at a higher price.  At $14,250, Bob is saving a significant amount compared to John's price, making it a reasonable decision to accept Alice's offer."
