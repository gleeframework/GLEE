{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to aim higher with Bob to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than my minimum.
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** While I know Bob values the product at $10,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he believes it's a fair deal or if it's important for him to secure the product immediately.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response and negotiating tactics, I might be willing to lower the price to secure the sale, but always aiming for the highest possible profit."
