"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $125?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise a bit.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?,115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just too low for me. How about $120? That's my absolute minimum, and it's still a great price for a product worth $120 to you.  Let's close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
