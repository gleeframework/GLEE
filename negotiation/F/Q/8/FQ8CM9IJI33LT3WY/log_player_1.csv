"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000.  This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I want to explore if I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,200,000. This is still a great price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $600,000 is still too low. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price. There's still a chance to reach a more favorable deal. Selling to John now is a safe option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a higher price from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product. It's truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go below $1,000,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let's find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $550000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower.  His offer of $550,000 is well below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While continuing negotiations is an option, there's a high risk of continuing to drop the price to levels I'm not comfortable with.  It's becoming increasingly likely that Bob is not willing to pay the value I need to get for this product.  

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This ensures I receive a price that's at least worth my minimum value, preventing further risk of losing more money through continued negotiations with Bob."
