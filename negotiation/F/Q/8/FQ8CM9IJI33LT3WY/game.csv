"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1200000. This is still a great price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $600000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product. It's truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go below $1000000. This price reflects the true worth of the product, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let's find a common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
