"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $2,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, I believe the product's inherent worth justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still not willing to pay $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that balances the product's value with my budget.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
