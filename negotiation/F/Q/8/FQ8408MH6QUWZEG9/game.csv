"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low. This product has immense value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  $950,000 is close, but I can't go that low. My final offer is $1,100,000. This is a fair deal for a product of this caliber.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
