Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product to me. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a price that is slightly higher than the minimum value of the product to me, but still relatively competitive. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a decent offer. Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll consider his offer carefully.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000, as it's below my minimum value. I'll send Bob a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Let's see what Bob does next!"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. Here's my counteroffer:

I'm trying to get closer to my initial offer of $900,000, while still being reasonable given Bob's previous offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
