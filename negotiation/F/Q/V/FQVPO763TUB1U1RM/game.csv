"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too far below my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $125 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $95? That's a fair offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and you'll be getting a great product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,6,
