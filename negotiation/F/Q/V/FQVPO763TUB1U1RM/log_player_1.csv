"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150 to leave room for negotiation.
* **Showing enthusiasm:** A friendly message shows I'm interested in a deal with Bob and might be willing to compromise. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:**  $175 allows for a few rounds of negotiation without me having to drop below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even far less than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:**  Selling to John for $150 is a safer option than accepting this low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too far below my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate further.
* **Finding middle ground:**  $125 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but also a compromise from my initial price.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize the value of the deal I'm offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $125 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $95? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price, $95 is still significantly less than my minimum of $150. 
* **Room for improvement:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price, especially with a few rounds left.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  Selling to John for $150 is a good option if I can't get a better price from Bob, but I want to explore all options first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and you'll be getting a great product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to work with him, but I'm not willing to drop my price too much.
* **Small compromise:**  $110 is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, suggesting a win-win scenario for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough to reach my desired price.
* **Limited room for compromise:** While $100 is close to my minimum, I'm unsure if I can convince Bob to go higher in the remaining rounds.
* **Selling to John guarantees profit:** Selling to John for $150 is a secure and profitable option, ensuring I don't lose out on a potentially better deal.  The risk of continued negotiation with Bob is too high, considering the limited time and the possibility of no deal."
