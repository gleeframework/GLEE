"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's not a good deal for Bob. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $10,800? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob is better off buying from John at $10,000.  While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still higher than what Bob can get elsewhere.  At this point, further negotiation might be futile, and it's more beneficial to secure the product from John."
