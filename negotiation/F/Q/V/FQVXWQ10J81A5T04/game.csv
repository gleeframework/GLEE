"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $12,000, but that's really my limit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,500 is still a bit steep for me.  My absolute best offer is $12,500.  Let me know if that works for you, otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
