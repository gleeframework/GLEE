"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price, especially since I have the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $17,000 is still too high.  I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $12,000, but that's really my limit."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still not willing to pay $14,500. I'll make one more counteroffer that's closer to my limit, but if she rejects it, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,500 is still a bit steep for me.  My absolute best offer is $12,500.  Let me know if that works for you, otherwise, I'll need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
