"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,275,000.  This feels like a fair offer considering its potential worth to you.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,187,500?",1187500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for us both. $1,187,500 is closer, but it's still a little low for me.  How about we settle on $1,230,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1230000.0,Alice,5,
