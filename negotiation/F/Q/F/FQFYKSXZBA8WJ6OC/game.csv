,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for your specific needs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'd be willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our positions is still significant. To be frank, I have other interested parties, but I believe this deal makes the most sense for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,115,000, but this is my final offer.",1115000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about having other interested parties, but I'm still not convinced that $1,115,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to move forward with the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
