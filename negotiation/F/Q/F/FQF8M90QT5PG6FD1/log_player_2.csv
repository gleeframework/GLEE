"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better price.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is happy to sell for $10,000, so there is room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your asking price and my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This way we both feel like we're getting a reasonable deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.
