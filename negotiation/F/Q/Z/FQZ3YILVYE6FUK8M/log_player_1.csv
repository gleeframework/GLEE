Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, at $150.  It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, but also ensures that you're starting at a price you're comfortable with.  The friendly message aims to establish a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than $100, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down to $135 for the product. That's still a fair price considering its value. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $125 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's also closer to Bob's offer, which makes it more likely he'll accept and we can close the deal. Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away completely."
