"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that's truly worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $850,000.  If you're willing to come down to that, we can make a deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the true value of the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really close to my maximum budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $912,500? This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident we can finalize everything quickly.",912500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much on the value of the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Alice,5,
