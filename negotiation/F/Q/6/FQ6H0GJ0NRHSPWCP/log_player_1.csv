"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. Let's see if we can work out a deal."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the value of this product. This is a fair offer, considering its worth and the potential benefits it offers your business.  Let's find common ground and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my bottom line of $1,500,000.  I'm not yet ready to settle for less, especially with John waiting in the wings. I'll counteroffer again, but if we don't get closer to my target, I'm ready to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1,550,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects a genuine desire to reach a deal with you.  Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and while I'm willing to compromise, I'm not willing to drop below my bottom line. John is a sure thing, offering my desired price, so I'm choosing to sell the product to him to avoid further negotiation and ensure I receive my desired price."
