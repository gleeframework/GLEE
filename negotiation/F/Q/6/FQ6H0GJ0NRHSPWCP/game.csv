"I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the value of this product. This is a fair offer, considering its worth and the potential benefits it offers your business.  Let's find common ground and reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1,550,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects a genuine desire to reach a deal with you.  Let's close this deal at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
