Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is $20 more than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to potentially make a profit.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is my minimum price, so it makes sense to accept his offer."
