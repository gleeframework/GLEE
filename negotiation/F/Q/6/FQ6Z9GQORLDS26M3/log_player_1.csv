Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping for a price closer to $11,000. It's still a good value for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still provides you with a great deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
