"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it. While I'm interested, $160 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $152. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",152.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $152 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",145.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $152 is still a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $148. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",148.0,Alice,5,
