Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my last offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,400. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10400}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is a significant improvement, I'm still confident that I can get a bit more from Bob.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've gone back and forth with Bob a few times, and while he's willing to negotiate, he's not budging much.  I'm starting to run out of time and the offers aren't getting me closer to my target price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get more, $8,000 is still a decent amount and guarantees I won't walk away with nothing."
