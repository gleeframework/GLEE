Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring Alice gets more than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""before anyone else,"" we aim to make Bob feel like he could miss out if he doesn't act quickly."
