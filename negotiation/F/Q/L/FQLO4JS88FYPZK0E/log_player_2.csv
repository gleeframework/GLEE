Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Let's start with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer.  This shows that we're serious about negotiating and opens the door for a compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is closer to our budget, it's still above our ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $12,000."

Let's try a counteroffer of $15,000. This is a compromise between our initial offer and Alice's latest offer, and shows that we're willing to meet halfway."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:

While $16,500 is tempting, it's still a bit above our comfort zone. We've already shown a willingness to compromise, and with John's offer as a backup, it's worth pushing for a final negotiation."

Let's offer $14,000. It's a final attempt at a compromise before we consider John's offer.  We're hoping to find a middle ground while still staying within our budget."

Alice is not budging much, and we've already negotiated a few times. While we're close to our budget with Alice's offer, it's still $4000 more than John's offer. To secure the best deal and stay within our budget, we should accept John's offer."
