Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start with a price that is higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate downwards.
* **Showing Flexibility:** Stating you're open to negotiation demonstrates a willingness to work with Bob, making him more likely to engage.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob, creating a positive impression. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  The goal is to maximize profit. While $125 is above the minimum, there's still room to potentially earn more. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer opens the door for a counteroffer from you.  You can try to bridge the gap and find a price both parties are happy with. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's not ideal. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive, with the possibility of a better outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider proposing a price slightly lower than your initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $135?  That's still a good value for this product, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  $135 is a midpoint between Alice's initial offer and Bob's offer, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the fairness of the compromise, making it more likely for Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $130 is very close to Alice's desired price range. Accepting this offer means a successful sale at a price that is significantly higher than the minimum and close to the initial offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While there's always a chance Bob could offer a higher price in a future round, there's also the risk he might not. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit without prolonging the negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing the negotiation comes with the risk that Bob might get frustrated and walk away, or that Alice might waste time and energy for a small potential gain. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the proximity of Bob's offer to Alice's desired price and the potential downsides of continued negotiation, accepting this offer seems like the most logical and profitable decision."
