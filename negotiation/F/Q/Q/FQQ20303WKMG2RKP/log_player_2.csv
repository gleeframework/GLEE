"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $15,000, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John immediately secures the product at your maximum price point."
