"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation and hopefully secures a good profit. 

It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any point. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, and his offer is significantly below that. I will counteroffer and try to reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation. I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 at this point. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to selling to John as the rounds go on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price and potentially a good deal for Bob. I'm trying to find a middle ground and close the deal, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
