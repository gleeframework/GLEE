"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. Buying from John is a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a clear expectation that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  Buying from John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer before switching to John.  It's at my absolute maximum price, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it to avoid losing the deal. This is a clear signal that further negotiations are unlikely to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous ones, it's still above my budget. I've already made my final counteroffer and it was rejected.  Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better price within my desired range, and I'm not willing to risk further rounds. Buying from John is the safest and most efficient option at this point."
