It's always best to try and negotiate a better price. Alice's offer is below your maximum, but there's room for improvement. By rejecting the offer, you can see if Alice is willing to go lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a substantial price reduction. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal. While this might seem aggressive, it's a good starting point for negotiation. If she rejects this, we can work our way up gradually."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and we're getting close to my target price.  Accepting this offer would save me $425,000 compared to buying from John. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal altogether or getting a worse offer from John in the future outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
