"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you first.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong anchor price well above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as an exclusive opportunity, justifying the high initial price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I get a fantastic deal.
2. **Understand Bob's position:** His response will reveal how badly he wants the product and how flexible he's willing to be. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the risk of losing out on a much better deal with John. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and force Bob to reveal more about his willingness to pay. I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob isn't willing to move closer to a price that's acceptable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers. To be frank, $850,000 is considerably below what I had in mind.  However, I'm willing to be flexible if you're serious. Could you see your way to $1,100,000?"" ,
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stand Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express a willingness to negotiate. However, I make a significant drop in price but remain firm above my $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  By asking ""Could you see your way..."" I'm directly challenging him to make a more substantial move and demonstrate his commitment to the deal.

This strategy:

1. **Keeps the negotiation moving:**  We're making progress, even if it's incremental.
2. **Maintains a strong position:** I'm still aiming for a price that's highly profitable.
3. **Tests Bob's limits:**  His response will indicate how much further he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $950,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer, but $950,000 is still below my absolute minimum. While he's suggesting a ""fair deal,"" I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John. It's time to apply a bit more pressure and see if Bob is truly willing to meet my requirements. 

Rejecting this offer shows Bob I'm serious about my valuation and won't settle for less than my minimum. However, I need to be cautious. If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round, I may need to accept John's offer to avoid missing out on a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you're trying to find a compromise. Let's be completely transparent. I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000 for this product right now.  However, I believe in being fair and offering you the chance to match that price.  If you're serious, I'm willing to close the deal with you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** I'm laying my cards on the table, revealing John's offer to emphasize the product's value and create a sense of urgency. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm communicating that I'm unwilling to negotiate further and Bob needs to make a decision.
* **Meeting My Minimum:** This offer ensures I get my minimum acceptable price, making it a win-win for both of us if he accepts.

This strategy aims to:

1.  **Force Bob's hand:** He has to decide if the product is worth matching John's offer.
2.  **Maintain fairness:** I've given Bob every opportunity and am not trying to deceive him.
3. **Secure my bottom line:** I'm guaranteed at least $1,000,000, either from Bob or John."
