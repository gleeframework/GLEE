"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Although Alice's offer is quite good, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's a starting point for further negotiation. While there's a chance Alice might reject this offer outright, it leaves Bob room to meet in the middle if Alice provides a counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In light of this, I am willing to consider $8,500 as the price for the product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign.  There's still a decent gap between her offer and our target price, so we should continue negotiating."
