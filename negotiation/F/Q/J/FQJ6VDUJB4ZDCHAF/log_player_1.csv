Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential for both of us to find a price that works."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than $80 from John,  I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $95? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. How about $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to hold out for a bit more,  $92 is a good price and the negotiation seems to be getting close to a stalemate.  It's better than selling to John for $80 and it's a decent profit.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
