"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $135.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $125 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm flexible, and I really want to see this product in your hands!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $127.50?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  $127.50 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $129.  Let's make this happen!",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, but $129 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $128, and that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",128.0,Bob,6,
