"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.
* **Justification:**  I'm giving a reason for the price to make it seem reasonable and not arbitrary.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, indicating I'm willing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

This opening offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product.  I'm setting a high bar, but leaving room to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary.  The threat of selling to John for $800,000 provides a safety net if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $800000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept.  However, I have 9 rounds left and want to see if I can get a better deal. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Explore higher offers:** I might be able to get a price closer to my initial $1 million asking price.
* **Gain more information:**  Bob's response will reveal how eager he is to buy the product. If he's desperate, he might increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully consider my next counteroffer to Bob. I'll balance the risk of losing the deal entirely with the desire to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price point. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my original offer and demonstrates my willingness to work with you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, indicating that it's not acceptable to me.
* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a new price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Justification:** I'm giving a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the reduction from my original price to show flexibility.
* **Openness to Further Negotiation:** I'm again leaving the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that significantly undervalues the product.
* **Tests Bob's eagerness:** It'll tell me how much Bob wants the product and whether he's willing to pay more.
* **Keeps the deal alive:** By making a counteroffer, I avoid losing the deal entirely and can see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 rounds left and want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Gain more information:** Bob's response will reveal how determined he is to buy the product at this price. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  I can leverage the fact that I have other options (including selling to John) to potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's current offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll aim to find a middle ground that's appealing to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our most recent offers - how about $875,000? This represents a significant compromise on my part and shows my commitment to finding common ground.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, signaling it's not acceptable.
* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between our most recent offers, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting the compromise on my part to emphasize my flexibility and commitment to a deal. 
* **Closing Statement:** I'm adding a sense of urgency and a call to action to encourage Bob to agree.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum.
* **Tests Bob's determination:** It gauges how much Bob wants the product at this price point. 
* **Keeps the deal alive:**  It avoids an outright rejection and offers a path to a potential agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response to gauge his willingness to accept the counteroffer or make a counteroffer himself.  Depending on the situation, I'll adjust my negotiation strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to go up to $860000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, and I only have 4 rounds left.  It's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers, as I could potentially lose the deal entirely. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000, the risk of not reaching an agreement outweighs the potential for a higher price.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decision that secures the deal.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is offering $800,000, Bob's offer of $860,000 is significantly better.

**Decision:**

I will accept Bob's offer of $860,000. This guarantees me a sale that is above my minimum and secures a good profit."
