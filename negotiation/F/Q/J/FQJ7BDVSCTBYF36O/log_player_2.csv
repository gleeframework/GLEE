"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $130. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $130.  This is a good deal, but Bob can try to get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $130 is a great price, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $120.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is now offering the product for $125, which is still a good deal for Bob. It's less than what he'd pay John, and it's close to his ideal price.  It's likely that Alice won't go lower, so accepting the offer is the best option."
