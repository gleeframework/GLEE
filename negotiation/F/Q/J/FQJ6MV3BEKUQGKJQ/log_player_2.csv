"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know you'll find immense value in it. I'm proposing a price of $800,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it at a fair price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product, and John is also willing to sell it at that price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer allows you to secure the product at the same price but potentially open the door for negotiation with Alice or other sellers in the future."
