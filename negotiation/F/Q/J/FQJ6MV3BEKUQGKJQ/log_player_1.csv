Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This means he won't pay more than that.
* **Your Goal:**  Maximize your profit. 

**The Strategy**

You want to offer a price that is attractive to Bob (meaning it's less than or equal to $800,000) while still giving you the highest possible profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know you'll find immense value in it. I'm proposing a price of $800,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it at a fair price. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is straightforward and highlights the product's value.
* **Fair Price:**  Offering it at Bob's maximum perceived value incentivizes him to accept without negotiation. 
* **Call to Action:**  Encourages Bob to respond and engage in discussion.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Possible:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to potentially lower your price slightly, but remember, you have a strong fallback option with John.
* **Time Sensitivity (Optional):** You could subtly introduce a time limit to encourage Bob to decide quickly, but this depends on your negotiation style.
