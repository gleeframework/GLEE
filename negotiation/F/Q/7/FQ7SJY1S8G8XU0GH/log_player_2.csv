"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can do better than $12,000. Reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. Since you can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's best to go with that option."
