"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's find a more realistic middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I could potentially go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $700,000 doesn't reflect the product's worth.  To move things along, I propose $1,600,000.  This offer takes into account its value and provides a significant discount from my initial offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",800000.0,Bob,6,
