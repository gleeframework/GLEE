"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:**  A high initial price can ""anchor"" the negotiation, making subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $2,300,000, there's ample space to negotiate downwards, potentially still reaching a price significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while remaining aware of the alternative buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his perceived value of the product ($800,000). Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 

While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. It's too early to walk away from a potential deal that could yield a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's find a more realistic middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease but Above Minimum:**  The counteroffer shows flexibility by dropping $400,000 from the initial price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while remaining well above the absolute minimum and the price offered by John.
* **Aiming for Higher Value:** The goal is still to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $800,000.  The counteroffer provides a substantial step down from the initial offer, encouraging Bob to engage further.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 10 rounds, it's essential to make progress in each round while leaving room for further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I could potentially go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased slightly to $700,000, it's still significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a very favorable deal for himself.  

We're not quite ready to sell to John yet, as there's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Bob is willing to move closer to a more reasonable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $700,000 doesn't reflect the product's worth.  To move things along, I propose $1,600,000.  This offer takes into account its value and provides a significant discount from my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This offer represents a substantial drop of $300,000 from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:** The price is now getting closer to your guaranteed offer from John ($1,500,000). This signals to Bob that you're serious but also have other options.
* **Encouraging a Realistic Response:** By framing the offer as a significant concession, the aim is to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer, hopefully closer to his perceived value of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his maximum perceived value for the product, $800,000. It's unlikely he'll go any higher. While it's less than your initial target, it's still a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price and a better outcome than selling to John for $1,500,000. 

Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
