"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product at a price that's fair for both of us. How does $12,000 sound? It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a great return.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,500.  Would you consider $8,750?  That would work for me.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a great opportunity to make a solid investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
