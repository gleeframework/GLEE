Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product at a price that's fair for both of us. How does $12,000 sound? It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a great return."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Bob is offering $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,500.  Would you consider $8,750?  That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below the $10,000 minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a great opportunity to make a solid investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $10,000 and I've already rejected his lower offers. It's time to accept and close the deal."
