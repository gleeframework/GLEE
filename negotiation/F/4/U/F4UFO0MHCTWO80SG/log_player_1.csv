"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value we both understand it holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $12,000.  While I could push for more, there's a risk he won't budge and I'll end up with John's offer of $10,000. Taking the $12,000 now is a guaranteed profit above my minimum."
