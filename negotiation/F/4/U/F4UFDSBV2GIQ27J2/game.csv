"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $13,500 feels fair. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? This considers both our positions.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,900? This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal.",11900.0,Alice,5,
