"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being positive and encouraging Bob to see the value in the product. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiating further, which is indicated by the message. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 8 rounds left to negotiate a better price with Bob. It's worth trying to get closer to my target.
* **John is a Secure Backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify my price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a compromise that could be appealing to Bob. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $9,000 is still above my minimum threshold, so it's a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,750 for your product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than the previous one, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I have 6 rounds remaining to potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's a chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly in the next rounds, especially as the number of rounds decreases."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to this purchase.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close this deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price again.
* **Emphasis on Closing:** I'm highlighting the importance of closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept.

* **John is Secure:** I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I have no pressure to accept a subpar offer.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We have only two rounds left, and Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of Low Price:**  There's a significant risk that Bob might not increase his offer in the final rounds, leaving me with a lower-than-desired profit.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Selling to John ensures I receive the maximum value for my product and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
