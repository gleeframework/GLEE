"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the value you place on it, and it allows me to make a good profit as well. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
