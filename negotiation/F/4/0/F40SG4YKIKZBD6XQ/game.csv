"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the best price I can do, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $1,220,000? That's a significant step from my initial offer, demonstrating my commitment to this deal.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,220,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,280,000. This is the best price I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting us very close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000 to try and close this deal. I'm hoping this demonstrates how serious I am about purchasing this product.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, and I can see that you're serious about purchasing the product. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,250,000 is getting closer but not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
