"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than her product valuation. There's room for negotiation to lower the price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below my $12,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is courteous but clearly states my position.
* **Targeting Alice's Valuation:** My goal is to get as close to Alice's $8,000 valuation as possible without revealing my own limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met me halfway, the new offer is still above her own valuation. This indicates there's a possibility of negotiating a lower price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** I'm willing to risk another counteroffer. The worst-case scenario is Alice rejects it, and I buy from John for $12,000. However, I stand to save a significant amount if I can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $8,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Valuation:** I'm now directly proposing a price that matches Alice's known valuation of the product. 
* **Clear and Firm:** This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a chance Alice might reject this offer. However, it's a calculated risk, as accepting it would be the most profitable outcome for her at this point."
