"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is using some sales tactics to inflate the product's value to you, her offer of $11,500 is still less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and the guaranteed price from John.  You save $500 compared to buying from John."
