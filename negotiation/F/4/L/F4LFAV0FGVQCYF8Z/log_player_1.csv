Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and the interest I've had in it, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""interest,"" you subtly create a sense of demand and desirability, justifying the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" implies flexibility and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counter-offers remain too low, you can always politely decline and proceed with selling to John."
