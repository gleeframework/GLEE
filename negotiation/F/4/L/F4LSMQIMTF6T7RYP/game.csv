"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is far too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the true value and the substantial benefits you'll gain.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $1,100,000. I think that's a very fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer doesn't reflect the significant value this product holds. To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession on my end and a very competitive offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I believe in giving you a fair chance.  My final offer is $1,550,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and my effort to find a solution for us both.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
