Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I believe in giving you a fair chance.  My final offer is $1,550,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and my effort to find a solution for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her $1,550,000 offer. She's introduced another buyer to create pressure. You're already exceeding your budget by $350,000.  It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,200,000."
