Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should buy the product from John. Even though Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's budget.  John is offering a price within Bob's budget, and it's the best option available."
