"Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
