"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $950,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is likely willing to sell the product for a price higher than her value of $800,000. A counteroffer of $850,000 is a good starting point, as it leaves room for further negotiation while still offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially secure a better price. You can still buy from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell, as she has already lowered her price from $950,000 to $975,000.  This counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant step closer to your desired price point and shows that you are serious about reaching a deal.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is now very close to John's offer, and there is a chance she will continue to be stubborn and refuse to come down further. To avoid a potentially endless negotiation, it is more efficient to purchase from John. You've successfully saved $12,500 compared to Alice's initial offer."
