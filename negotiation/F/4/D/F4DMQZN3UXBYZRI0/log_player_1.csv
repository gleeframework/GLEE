Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can we try again? I'd be willing to go up to $100, but no higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob offering $100 meets my minimum requirement. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and guarantees a sale at my desired minimum."
