"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with an offer of $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart from $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. I'll counter with an offer of $17,000. This is my best and final offer on this price point, but I'm open to negotiations.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $13,500. Is that something you'd consider?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth my while to continue negotiations. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'll counter with an offer of $16,500. This is my final offer, and I expect it to be accepted.",16500.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I need to be at least at $16,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'll counter with an offer of $16,000. If this is not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,9,
