Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise. It's above what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than what I could get from John. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It highlights the value of the product without being overly pushy. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I'm hoping to entice him into buying while still making a profit. If he rejects, I can confidently sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
