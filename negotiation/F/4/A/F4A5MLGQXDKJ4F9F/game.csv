"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $9,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the product's worth to me is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,750. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This offer reflects the product's value to you while still allowing me to save some money.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,5,
