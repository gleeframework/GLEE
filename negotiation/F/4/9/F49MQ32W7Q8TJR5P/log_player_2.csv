"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum price of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still higher than my maximum price of $1,200,000.  However, it's closer to my target price, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,325,000 is still above my maximum price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower. I've already made several concessions, and further negotiations might not lead to a better deal.  I'll buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is the best price I can get."
