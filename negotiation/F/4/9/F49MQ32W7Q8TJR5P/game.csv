"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,250,000 right now.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I truly hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
