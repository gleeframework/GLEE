"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $8,750? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
