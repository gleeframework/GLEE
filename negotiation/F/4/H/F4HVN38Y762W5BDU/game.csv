"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this price respects the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This price reflects the product's value and provides a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",875000.0,Alice,3,
