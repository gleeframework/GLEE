"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $8000. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
