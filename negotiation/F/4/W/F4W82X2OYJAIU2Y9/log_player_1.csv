"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $180 is closer to my minimum price, I think I can get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}

I'm countering with $190. This is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to reach a middle ground and close the deal in this round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $170 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I have several rounds left and don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $165 is better than what John is offering, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. With several rounds left, I want to continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision. While I'd love to keep negotiating, I only have two rounds left.  Accepting $155 is better than selling to John for $150.  It's a small but meaningful gain."
