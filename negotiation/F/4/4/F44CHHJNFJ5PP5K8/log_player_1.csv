Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  By offering it at $175, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he tries to negotiate, we know he's interested and can potentially still meet our minimum. 
* **Safety Net:**  We have John as a backup buyer who will pay $150, so we don't risk losing money if Bob rejects the offer."
