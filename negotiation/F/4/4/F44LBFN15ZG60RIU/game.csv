"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust the price slightly. My counteroffer is $875,000 for the product. This still allows for a good profit margin while being more accessible to your budget.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, which would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",860000.0,Bob,4,
