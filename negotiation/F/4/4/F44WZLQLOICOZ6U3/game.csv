"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I am willing to consider your offer of $100. However, due to the production costs and the value we put into this product, I need to set a minimum price of $110. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, $107 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $102 for the product.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already stretched my budget to its limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm going to have to seriously consider buying the product from John for $80 if we can't come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,10,
