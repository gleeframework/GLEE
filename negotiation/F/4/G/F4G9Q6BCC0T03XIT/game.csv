"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $125 to make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $122.50?",122.5,Alice,5,
