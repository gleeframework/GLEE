Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at this price point still yields a considerable profit over John's offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice can adjust her approach accordingly."
