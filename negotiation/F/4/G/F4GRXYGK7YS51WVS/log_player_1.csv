Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 because you have John as a guaranteed backup buyer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him if he buys from you. 
* **Your Goal:**  Maximize your profit. Ideally, you want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer.

**Offer Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer. This lets you be a bit bolder with your offer to Bob. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High (but reasonable):**  Don't start at $1,200,000. While that's his maximum valuation, it leaves you no room to negotiate if he tries to counter-offer. 
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offer a price that gives Bob a reason to negotiate but still nets you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point that positions you well for negotiation.
* **Potential for Profit for Bob:**  This price still allows Bob to potentially profit if he utilizes the product effectively.
* **Safeguards Your Minimum:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob comes back with a counter-offer."
