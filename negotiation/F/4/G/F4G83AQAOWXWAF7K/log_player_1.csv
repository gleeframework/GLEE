Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's worth the value, so I'm proposing a price of $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $115 allows us to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a feeling of getting a fair deal ($5 gain compared to his perceived value). 
* **Alternative Considered:** While we could try for a higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting and forcing us to sell to John at $100 is substantial. This offer balances risk and reward."
