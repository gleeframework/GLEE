Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [Product Name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 allows some space for Bob to counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, reminding Bob of its worth to him.
* **John as a Backup:** It's important to remember that Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John. This knowledge gives Alice leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
