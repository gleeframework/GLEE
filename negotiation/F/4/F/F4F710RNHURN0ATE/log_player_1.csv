Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Opening:**  Offering a specific price shows confidence and gives Bob a concrete starting point for consideration.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
