"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* You have room to negotiate with Alice, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still gives you a substantial advantage, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000.
* While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a price that's good for you, while still leaving you some room to potentially make a profit if you resell the product later."
