Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,015,000 for the product. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, considering the value you're offering and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
While I could continue negotiating, Bob has shown he is unlikely to move much beyond his $1,015,000 offer. Accepting this offer provides a gain of $15,000 over John's standing offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
