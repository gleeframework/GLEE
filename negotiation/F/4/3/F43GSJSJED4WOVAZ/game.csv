"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way we both walk away happy. ",100.0,Alice,5,

I'm not sure $100 is the best deal for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $98?,98.0,Bob,6,
