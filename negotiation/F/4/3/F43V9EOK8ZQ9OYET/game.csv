"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still reflects the value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a great product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make a little more to make this work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product. Let's finalize this deal.",9750.0,Alice,5,
