Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, which could encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Prepared for Counteroffers:** I'm ready to counter if Bob rejects the initial offer, and I have a fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate.  I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still reflects the value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a great product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the higher price.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm expressing willingness to find common ground, signaling flexibility and encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Close to a Deal:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have John's offer of $12,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price closer to $10,000 to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
