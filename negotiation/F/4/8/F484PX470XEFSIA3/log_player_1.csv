I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.  This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise,  but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'm confident that selling to Bob for $1,600,000 is better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
