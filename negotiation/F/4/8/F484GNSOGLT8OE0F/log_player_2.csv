"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You value the product at $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $11,500. This is a $500 saving compared to buying from John. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even at $11,500, you're getting the product for more than Alice values it ($8,000). This means you're still getting a good deal."
