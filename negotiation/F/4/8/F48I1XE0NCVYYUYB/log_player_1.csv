{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a good price. It's also friendly and encourages Bob to engage in conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to push for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $12,000, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer by pushing for a higher price."
