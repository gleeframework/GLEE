You can do better than $130.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $125, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $127? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice has come down to $127.  This is a good price for you, as it's lower than what you would pay John.  There's no need to push for a lower price and risk Alice walking away."
