"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think you'll be very pleased with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still a significant amount more than what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A $10,000 offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and reflects Bob's desire to get a good deal.  However, it's still above Alice's valuation, making it a potentially acceptable offer. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message explains Bob's reasoning for the counteroffer, making it more persuasive. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  $12,000 is still above what the product is worth to Alice and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Aiming for a Lower Price:** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a price closer to his ideal.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  Buying from John for $15,000 is not the most cost-effective option at this point.  

Bob will continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob is offering a slightly higher price than his previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate but also emphasizing his desire for a lower price.
* **Staying Within Budget:** $11,000 is still well within Bob's budget and allows for potential future negotiation.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message conveys a willingness to reach an agreement while leaving room for Alice to make a final counteroffer."
