"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's equally valuable to you. My initial offer is $1,500,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $500,000 is significantly less than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
