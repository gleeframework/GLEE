"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's equally valuable to you. My initial offer is $1,500,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a significant amount, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Bob is clearly undervaluing the product, and I believe I can secure a better deal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $500,000 is significantly less than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
