This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,000? This is still a great value for you, as you value the product at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10000. How about we meet at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $9,500 which is close to my desired price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get even closer, I'd rather secure the sale at this point than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
