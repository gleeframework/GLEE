"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet her at $990,000. Can we make a deal at that price?",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $990,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's persistence, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on her final offer. I'd be willing to meet her at $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If she's not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
