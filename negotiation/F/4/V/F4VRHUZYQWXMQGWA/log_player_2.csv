"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I am proposing a price of $130 for it. I understand that this might be slightly above your initial expectations, but considering its worth to you, I believe this is a fair deal. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer, potentially closer to $100 (her value). Even if she doesn't budge much, buying from John at $150 is always an option."
