"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,250. How about we try $12,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. How about we try $12,800? I think that's a good compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",12800.0,Bob,6,
