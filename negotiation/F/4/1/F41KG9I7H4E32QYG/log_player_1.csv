Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it would be a great fit. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  You know John will buy the product for $12,000, so that's your safety net. Aiming for a price between $12,000 and Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $11,500 tempts Bob with a $1,500 saving compared to his perceived value. This leaves you a profit margin of $500 over your guaranteed sale to John.
* **First Refusal Tactic:** Highlighting that Bob gets the first offer creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially swaying his decision."
