"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price:** You want to pay less than $1,000,000, and Alice is offering $950,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Since Alice is willing to sell for less than your maximum, there's room for negotiation.  
* **Buying from John is not the best option:**  John's price is your absolute limit. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

* **Negotiation is still possible:** You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice has indicated flexibility. 
* **Buying from John is not the best option yet:**  While you're getting closer to your limit, you might be able to get a better price with another counteroffer."

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** You are aiming to stay below $950,000 and Alice is offering $972,500.
* **The difference is small:** The price difference is only $22,500. While you want to save as much as possible, it's getting close to your limit. 
* **You have leverage:** You've shown willingness to negotiate and Alice has already compromised once. You can likely get her to budge a bit further. 
* **Buying from John is still a worse option:** You can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
