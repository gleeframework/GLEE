"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and see what Bob's maximum value is.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm countering with $9,800. This is a small concession from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to get a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,300 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm countering with $9,600. I'm lowering my price again, but still trying to stay above my minimum of $8,000.  We're getting closer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call! It's getting close to my minimum of $8,000, and we're already on round 6.  There's a chance Bob might go lower, but I'm also running out of rounds.  I'm going to take the risk and accept his offer. I think it's the best I can get at this point."
