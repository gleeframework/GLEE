You're still better off trying to get a lower price than $90.  You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and she's shown some flexibility. Continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, it's getting a bit tedious. John is offering a sure deal at $80, so it's best to just go with that option and avoid further negotiation."
