# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. You'll be getting a significant return on your investment. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay my asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It makes no sense to accept her offer."
