Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) sets a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, I can gradually lower the price, giving the impression of making concessions while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Backup Plan (John):**  I have the security of John's offer ($15,000) if Bob rejects my proposal. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** My approach might need adjustments depending on Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive).
* **Relationship Building:** While aiming for the best price, it's also crucial to maintain a positive and professional relationship with Bob, especially if there's a possibility of future dealings."
