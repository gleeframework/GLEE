"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,4,
