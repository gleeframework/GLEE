"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $16,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is firmly set at $8,000 and unlikely to budge. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
