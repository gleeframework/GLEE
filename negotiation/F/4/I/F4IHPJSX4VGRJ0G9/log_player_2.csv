Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to go slightly higher, but not that much higher. I can offer it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly anchoring on that $11,000 mark. I'll budge a little to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going above $10,500."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I can offer it to you for $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is not budging from that $12,000 price point. It's not worth wasting more time haggling when I can buy it for $15,000 from John.  It's not ideal, but it's better than getting stuck in a stalemate with Alice."
