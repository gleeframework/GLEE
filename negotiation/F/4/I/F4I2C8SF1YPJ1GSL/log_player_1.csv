Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a good investment."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or at least secure my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $1,600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and it leaves room for a profitable agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1600000 is still slightly out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1550000 for the product, which is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I believe this price is in line with the value of the product for both of us, and it provides a good starting point for a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. It's important to remember that I have a backup option in John, so I don't need to be too aggressive in this round."
