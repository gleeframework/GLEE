Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you. I'm initially offering it for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price. I'm not willing to settle for $15,000 yet, especially since I know John is willing to pay that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 is a fair offer, I'm looking to get a little closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $18,000? This is a significant product with potential for high returns."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the potential of the product, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $16,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $17,000.  This gives us both a fair deal and lets me move forward with selling the product."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $16,500 is a good price, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, I might lose him entirely. I'm also getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out to John."
