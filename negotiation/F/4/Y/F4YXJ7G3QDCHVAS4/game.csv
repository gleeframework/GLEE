"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you. I'm initially offering it for $20000. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15000 is a fair offer, I'm looking to get a little closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $18000? This is a significant product with potential for high returns.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the potential of the product, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16000. Can you consider this revised offer?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $17000.  This gives us both a fair deal and lets me move forward with selling the product.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",16500.0,Bob,6,
