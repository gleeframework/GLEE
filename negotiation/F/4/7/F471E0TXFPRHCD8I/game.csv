"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This reflects its worth to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to move the negotiation forward.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your willingness to negotiate.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make another concession to keep the negotiation going. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is my minimum price. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to keep the negotiation going. I'll sell the product to you for $9,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down further.  $9,750 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to offer a final price of $9,600. I really see the value in this product, and I think this price is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement.",9600.0,Bob,8,
