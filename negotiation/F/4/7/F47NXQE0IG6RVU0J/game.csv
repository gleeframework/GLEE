,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $110? It's a really great product and you won't regret it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is my absolute maximum. If this works for you, I'd be happy to buy it.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $102.5?  This would be my final offer.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still stuck at $95. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
