Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $110? It's a really great product and you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is my absolute maximum. If this works for you, I'd be happy to buy it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $102.5?  This would be my final offer."", ""product_price"": 102.5}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still stuck at $95. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is unlikely to go above $95.  While further negotiation might squeeze a few more dollars, it's not worth the risk of him walking away.  Selling to John guarantees the $120, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob."
