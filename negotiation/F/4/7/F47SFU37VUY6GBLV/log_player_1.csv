"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount above my minimum, but also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good price for Bob, and it's closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer to him."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,800.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more,  $8,700 is still a good deal for me, especially since we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and the risk of having to sell to John for $8,000."
