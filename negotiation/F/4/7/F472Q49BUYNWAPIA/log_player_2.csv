The price is far too high. It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously.  This represents a 50% reduction from her original offer."

While this is getting closer to my limit, it's still above my preferred price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my limit, and we've had several rounds of back and forth. While I'm hoping for a better price, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. It's best to cut my losses and buy from John for $1,200,000."
