I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, but it's also a price that I'm happy with. If Bob rejects, I can always go with John's offer for $10,000.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is way too low for me.  I'm not going to accept that. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000.  This is still a good price for me, and I hope Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to get the product for as cheap as possible. While $9,000 is better than $8,000, it's still not a good enough price for me. I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed deal and it's a fair price."
