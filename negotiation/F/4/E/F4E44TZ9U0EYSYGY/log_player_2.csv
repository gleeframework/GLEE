"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a better price than John's $100, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows for a counteroffer and the potential to get an even better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still too high.  There's still potential to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further, especially since she already rejected your counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $89 is the best deal we've seen so far, and it's within our budget of $100. Accepting this offer saves us $11 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting our counteroffer and potentially leading to a higher price from her or being forced to buy from John at $100 outweighs the potential small savings."
