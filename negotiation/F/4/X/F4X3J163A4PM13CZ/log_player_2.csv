"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price. You can offer a lower price and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $950000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better opportunity like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to your price, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $975000. I think this is a reasonable price that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away. It's also likely she won't go lower than $950,000, and you'd be stuck paying $1,200,000 from John. Accepting her offer at $975,000 is the most cost-effective option."
