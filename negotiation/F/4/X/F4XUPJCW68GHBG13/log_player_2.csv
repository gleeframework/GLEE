"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $12,000. This is a great deal considering its true value is significantly higher.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure if I want to pay $12,000 for it. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll reject Alice's offer. I'll see what else is out there.
