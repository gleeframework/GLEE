Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum value of $8,000 but leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **It reflects Bob's potential value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so $10,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **It sets the tone for a positive negotiation:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport.

This is just the first step. Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more.  You can use the fact that he's already shown interest to negotiate a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This would still give me a decent profit while also being closer to your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  You've already lowered your price twice, and Bob is clearly not willing to go higher. Accepting this offer gets you closer to your desired price and secures a sale without risking further negotiation or losing out to John."
