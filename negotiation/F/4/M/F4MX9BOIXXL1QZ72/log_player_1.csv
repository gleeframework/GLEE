Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,112,500 is still a bit too high for me. While I acknowledge the value of the product, I'm  prepared to offer $1,075,000. This offer represents a significant compromise  from my previous offer and reflects a realistic price point for the value I  see in the product. I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement that benefits  both of us.

We're still some way off from a price I'd be happy with. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so I believe I can push for a better deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,093,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to offer $1,080,000. This price is very close to your last offer and reflects a serious attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We're both very close to a deal, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I believe I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is already a significant profit. It's important to recognize when we've reached a good deal, and this offer reflects that. Accepting now avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether and ensures a positive outcome for both parties."
