"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal. I'll sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make it to you because I think you're the right fit for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is still over Bob's budget. He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's already made several counteroffers and Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,025,000, which is still outside of his budget.  John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is within Bob's budget.  It's better to secure the product at a price he can afford than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
