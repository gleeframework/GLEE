"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a chance to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still a good price, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I believe I have room to negotiate further and can likely get closer to my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It demonstrates flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting closer, but I still believe I can push for a higher price.  I'm willing to take the risk of going another round to see if I can get him up to $1,300,000 or even closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to stick with my strategy of meeting Bob halfway.  $1,300,000 is a solid compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price.  If he rejects this offer, I'm likely to go ahead and sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the rounds and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum. However,  I'm not confident I can get him to my target price within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  It's a safe and practical choice."
