Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,000,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee we can negotiate him higher, and waiting carries the risk of him reducing his offer.  We'll take the sure $1,500,000."
