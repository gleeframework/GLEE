"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This price still offers you a significant value, and it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $1,350,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000. This is closer to my budget and still allows for a good value for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,340,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
