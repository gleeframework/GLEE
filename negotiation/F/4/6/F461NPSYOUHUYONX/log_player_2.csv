"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $12000. I think it's a steal at this price, considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I buy from her, I'll end up paying $2,000 more than I need to. I'll try to get a better deal.
