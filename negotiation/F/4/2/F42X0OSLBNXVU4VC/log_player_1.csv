"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price.
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to open a dialogue rather than be confrontational. This encourages Bob to engage and potentially reveal more about his valuation.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the offer is high, remember you have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000. This knowledge allows you to be bolder in your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product is useful to me, but not at that price. How about we bring it down to $1,200,000 and start from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to his perceived value, you have plenty of room to negotiate and time is on your side (for now). Accepting this offer would be premature. You'll counter in the next round to try and steer the negotiation closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Its unique features and potential for your business are substantial.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Not Really):**  While saying ""middle ground,"" this counteroffer strategically moves down less aggressively than Bob's jump. This maintains a strong position. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob's business, subtly anchoring his perception to a higher price point.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be and provide further information for your negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but we're still a ways off.  Let's try a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe that reflects a more reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum threshold of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for more, the difference is now relatively small.
* **Time Value:** You're past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a slightly higher price from Bob might cost you the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John if negotiations drag on. 

It's a good deal!"
