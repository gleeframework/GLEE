Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a starting point that balances getting a decent price while still being appealing to Bob.  It's above his perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'm going to try to get closer to that by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to try another counteroffer,  $95 is still below my minimum price of $150 and the negotiation seems to be dragging on. To ensure I get my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John."
