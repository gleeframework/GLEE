"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a significant sum, this product offers substantial value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This reflects the product's worth while still giving you a great deal.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at $1,150,000. This price is fair for both of us and will allow us to move forward with the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
