Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to invite Bob to respond and start a conversation. 

This approach balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum of $120. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer of $120 gives me the security to hold out for a better price from Bob.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer to try and negotiate a higher price. I believe that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $95 is too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to still make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still above Bob's offer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. This emphasizes the fairness of my price.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. This keeps the conversation moving forward.

By striking a balance between my minimum price and Bob's offer, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that will satisfy both of us and ensure a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is only $20 below my minimum price of $120. This is a significant compromise from his previous offers.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing the negotiation could take longer, potentially costing me time and energy.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it's a good compromise and allows me to close the deal quickly. It's important to balance my desire for the highest price with the need to secure a sale and avoid potential complications."
