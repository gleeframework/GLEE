"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $77.50. Can we meet there?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $77.50 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to accept $81.25 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us.",81.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $79.50. Can we do that?",79.5,Bob,6,
