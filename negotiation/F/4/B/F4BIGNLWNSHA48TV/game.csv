"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. While $800000 is tempting, it's still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging its importance to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my initial price point and allows you to sell the product for a price above what it's worth to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for everyone.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing a new price of $1052000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging its importance to you. What do you think?",1052000.0,Alice,5,
