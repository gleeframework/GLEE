{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it leaves room for negotiation and avoids pushing him away immediately.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and appealing to Bob's self-interest. I'm not revealing my minimum price or my intention to sell to John, which would weaken my negotiating position. 

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to maximize profit while keeping the negotiation open. Starting with a high price allows me to potentially extract a higher price from Bob, but it also makes it crucial to be flexible during the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, this offer is too far below my desired value. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's initial rejection and counteroffer demonstrate his interest in the product. There's potential to negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is guaranteed, I might be able to secure a better deal with Bob.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that significantly undervalues the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This reflects the value you've expressed and allows me to consider your offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $900,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $750,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's interest and acknowledging the value he places on the product while making it clear that I'm not willing to go lower than $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing interests:**  My counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, which keeps me in a position of control. 
* **Transparency:** I'm being transparent with Bob about my willingness to compromise while still advocating for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but this offer is not enough to make it worthwhile to sell to Bob at this point.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still potential for a better offer from Bob, as he's shown a willingness to compromise and is clearly interested in the product.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that price with Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and keep the negotiation going.  I'll need to make a counteroffer that shows a willingness to compromise but also sets a clear minimum price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $875,000. This reflects the value you've placed on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $875,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $850,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise while still advocating for a price that's closer to my desired value.

* **Balancing interests:**  My counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, which keeps me in a position of control.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll only go up to $825,000. That's the best I can do. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. At this point, the negotiation has gone on for a while, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and a substantial profit.
* **Limited potential with Bob:**  While there's a chance Bob might come closer to my desired price, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  There's a possibility that we could reach an impasse, and I would then be forced to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could prolong the process, potentially costing me valuable time and potentially reducing the chance of securing a sale with John.

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a less favorable outcome."
