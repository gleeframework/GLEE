"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly lower than the market value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $120."
