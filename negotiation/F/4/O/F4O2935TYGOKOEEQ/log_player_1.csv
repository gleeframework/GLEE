Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. By offering $150, I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest without immediately going too low. If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. $120 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can get a better price. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, considering your interest. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer and is now at $125. While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $125 is a decent compromise, especially since I can always sell to John for $100 if I don't close this deal."
