It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also gives us room to find a mutually agreeable price."

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but I'm still hopeful I can get a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Alice has come down to a price that's within my acceptable range.  While I could potentially try to get a lower price, it's not worth risking the deal for a small amount of money."
