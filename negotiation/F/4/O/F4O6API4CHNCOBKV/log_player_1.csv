"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message positive and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiating to show Bob that there's room for a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product sounds great. I'd like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
