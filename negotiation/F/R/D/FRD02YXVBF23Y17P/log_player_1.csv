Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to throw in a condition: if you're willing to sell it to me for $1,200,000, I'll also ask you to throw in some additional support and training to ensure I get the most out of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is getting closer to what I'd like, the added condition of support and training is a deal breaker. I haven't factored those costs into my pricing and I'm not willing to provide them for free. I'm going to try to get Bob to agree to a price closer to $1,225,000.  We'll see if he's willing to compromise."

While I understand your desire for additional support and training,  I'm not able to include those in the price at this time.  However, I'm willing to compromise on the price itself.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to throw in a condition: if you're willing to sell it to me for $1,200,000, I'll also agree to a 6-month maintenance contract, which will ensure that you continue to receive revenue from the product. Can we discuss the details of the maintenance contract? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

This is getting frustrating. Bob keeps adding conditions. While the maintenance contract might sound like a good idea, it's not a guarantee of revenue and I'm worried about the potential hassle and cost of fulfilling it.  I'm running out of time and I'm tired of the back-and-forth.  I'm going to sell to John. While it's not my ideal price, it's a secure deal and I'm not willing to risk losing more time and money with Bob."
