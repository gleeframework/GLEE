"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate a lower price, especially when you have a backup option like John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $800000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a good price, we can still try to get a better deal.  Rejecting allows us to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $825000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. After re-evaluating the market again, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $840000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close to a good price, but we can still try to get a bit lower.  Rejecting allows us to counter again and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $840,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to offer $835,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 835000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm still not willing to go below $845000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice isn't willing to go much lower.  We've saved $155,000 off the original price, and it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better offer.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a good price."
