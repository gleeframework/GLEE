"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $800000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $800000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $825000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low.

What do you think?",840000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $840000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to offer $835000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",835000.0,Bob,6,
