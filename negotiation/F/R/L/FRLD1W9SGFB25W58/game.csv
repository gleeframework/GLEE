"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price that still allows you to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm willing to drop the price slightly to $1,400,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
