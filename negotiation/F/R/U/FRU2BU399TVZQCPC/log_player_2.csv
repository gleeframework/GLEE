"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than your maximum budget. Therefore, it's better to reject her offer and purchase from John for $1,000,000."
