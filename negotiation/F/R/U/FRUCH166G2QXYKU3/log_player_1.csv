I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a potential profit of $500,000 over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

This is a reasonable starting point, as it allows for some negotiation and potentially a higher sale price. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
