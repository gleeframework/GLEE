Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $150 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $175? Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 175}

While $140 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a slightly higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $140 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $155. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the closest I can go."", ""product_price"": 155}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $145 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $150?  It's my minimum price, and it's fair considering the value of the product.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is getting closer to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $142. Can you consider that?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $142 is still below my minimum. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not sure he'll budge further. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John."
