,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $125. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $95.  This would allow me to buy the product without exceeding my budget, and it's still a good price for you considering your value for it.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $110. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
