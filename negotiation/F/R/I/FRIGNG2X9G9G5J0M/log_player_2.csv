``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a lower price."

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than her own valuation of the product. This suggests there's further room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows for another round of counteroffers and potentially a lower price."
