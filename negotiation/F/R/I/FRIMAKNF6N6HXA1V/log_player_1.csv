"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and still ensures I make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product enough to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John for $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident enough in the product's value that I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $15,000, but it's still a significant profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept the offer. If he rejects it again, I'll have to reassess my strategy and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $13,500 is a good price, significantly higher than selling to John.  Although I'd like to push for a higher price, I'm aware that continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. It's important to weigh the potential gains against the possibility of walking away with nothing.  $13,500 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
