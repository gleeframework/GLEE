Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower, opening with a price above his valuation leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a strong initial position.
* **Justification:** The message hints at broader benefits and exclusivity, aiming to justify the high price somewhat, even if those benefits aren't explicitly stated.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is open for discussion (""What do you think?""), encouraging Bob to counter-offer rather than just saying a flat ""no.""

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, aiming higher initially can potentially lead to a better outcome with Bob."
