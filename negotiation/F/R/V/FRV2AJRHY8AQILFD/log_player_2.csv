"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and believe a price of $900,000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows you to recoup a significant portion of your value while still being within my price range."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,100,000 represents a fair price considering the value this product brings, I understand your budgetary concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent worth of the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?  This would be a significant step closer to my budget and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's full value, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about splitting the difference and settling at $987,500? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, Bob is still over his budget.  Even at $987,500, Bob is paying more than he would if he simply bought from John.  Therefore, the best course of action is to go with John's offer and save the additional money."
