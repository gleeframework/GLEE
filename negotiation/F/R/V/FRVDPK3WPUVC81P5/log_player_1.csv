Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for slightly less and still make a profit, aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, giving me leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Backup Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum.

By starting at $14,000, I'm aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain if he accepts."
