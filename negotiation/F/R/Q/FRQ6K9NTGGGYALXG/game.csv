"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000, which is the price I was initially willing to accept from John. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Alice,5,
