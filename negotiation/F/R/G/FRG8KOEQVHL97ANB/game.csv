"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as the product is still worth a significant amount to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I believe the product holds value, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $1,000,000? This would be a beneficial deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can understand that.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
