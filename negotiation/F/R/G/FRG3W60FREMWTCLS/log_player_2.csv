"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.

Alice has come down to her product's value to her.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this is already a significant saving compared to John's offer."
