"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in this scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong negotiating position and signals Bob's serious intent to get a lower price.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will set the stage for future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and provides an opportunity to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his counteroffer, showing Alice he's serious about buying but also determined to get a better price.  $12,000 represents a good middle ground between Alice's previous offer and Bob's initial counteroffer. This could be a good point for Alice to consider, as she's already lowered her price."
