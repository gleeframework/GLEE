Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $9,750. This is my final offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $8,500 is my absolute lowest price. This offer stands for 24 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500. While she might come down slightly in further rounds, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price or even raising it again as a negotiation tactic. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is our maximum budget. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price."
