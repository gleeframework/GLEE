"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, that price point is a little high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $7,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $8,200 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $8,000. Would you consider $7,500?  That's a firm offer from my end.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get as close to $8,000 as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $7,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",7800.0,Alice,5,
