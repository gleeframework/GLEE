"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is too high.  While it's within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  $1,300,000 is a reasonable starting point as it's still above Alice's minimum desired price of $1,200,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also firm in his desire to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This considers both our valuations and moves us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer.  At this price, Bob is getting a decent discount and is still within his budget.  Accepting the offer saves time and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a higher price or a failed deal altogether.  Buying from John would be more expensive, making Alice's offer the most financially advantageous option at this stage."
