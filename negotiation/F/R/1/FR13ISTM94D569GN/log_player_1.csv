"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to respond with either acceptance or a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I'm showing Bob I'm listening by acknowledging his offer.
* **Counter with Justification:**  Instead of just stating a new price, I'm offering a ""fair compromise"" and highlighting the value proposition again to keep Bob engaged.
* **Maintain a Negotiating Position:**  I'm still aiming for a price higher than Bob's initial offer, but I'm showing flexibility and willingness to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $92? It's a bit closer to your asking price, but I'm trying to save a bit of money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my last counteroffer of $95.  At this point, I'm considering the risk of further negotiation. While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's a chance that Bob will reject my counteroffer, and I'll risk losing him as a buyer.  Since I'm approaching my minimum value, it's more prudent to accept his offer and secure the sale."
