"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering my own assessment of its value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, I'm still confident in the initial price I presented. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This represents a significant reduction on my end while acknowledging the value this product holds.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1,400,000. It's a good compromise that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
