Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us. Let's try to reach a deal this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my goal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
