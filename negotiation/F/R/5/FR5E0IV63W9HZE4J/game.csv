"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us. Let's try to reach a deal this round.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
