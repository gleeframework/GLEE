"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm genuinely interested in the product but can only offer $700,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $925,000. This is a compromise, reflecting my willingness to make a deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
