"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11750?  That's a fair price that's still within my range.  Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11750 is still a bit more than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to pay $11600. If that works for you, I'm ready to buy the product.",11600.0,Bob,4,
