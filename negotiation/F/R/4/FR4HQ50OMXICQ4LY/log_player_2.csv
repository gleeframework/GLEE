# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11750?  That's a fair price that's still within my range.  Let me know what you think.
