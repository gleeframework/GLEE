"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $90 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  How about we split the difference at $97.50?  That way we both get a good deal. What do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can meet you at $97.50, but I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you consider that?",92.0,Bob,6,
