"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $175. This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This counteroffer is Bob's maximum price for the product. It is a bold move, but it reflects Bob's commitment to getting the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer, but only up to $130. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There are still 5 rounds left, and Bob might be able to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

Bob is increasing his offer again, but only slightly. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still trying to get a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now $145, which is only $25 above Bob's maximum price. Given that Bob has only 3 rounds left, it makes sense to accept the offer and avoid risking a further negotiation that might lead to buying from John at $120. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept a lower offer, and there's a risk of losing the deal altogether."
