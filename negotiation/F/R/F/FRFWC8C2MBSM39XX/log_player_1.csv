Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives Bob a good deal, while still leaving me with a profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, this is a safe starting point. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,000 is a decent profit and better than selling to John for $15,000.  Further negotiation might take longer and doesn't guarantee a better outcome."
