"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.  I believe this is still a good price for you considering your own valuation and it's the most I can reasonably offer at the moment. ",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $11,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering your valuation and my own budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $12,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12750.0,Alice,5,
