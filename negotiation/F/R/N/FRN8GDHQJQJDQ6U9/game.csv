"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't accept $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's unique value and the effort I've put into it.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I was thinking we could meet at $1300000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to make a serious commitment, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1300000 just yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. It's a fair compromise considering the value I've placed on it.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1325000. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product.",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $1360000. I'm willing to meet you at $1320000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good value for my money.",1320000.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, I appreciate all the concessions you've made, but I'm still not comfortable with $1335000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to get it for $1300000 or less. I think that's a fair price considering the value I've done my research on. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price",1300000.0,Bob,10,
