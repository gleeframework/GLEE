"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000, but that's the lowest I can go. I'm confident the product is worth it to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1100000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you in the middle at $1200000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
