Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find really valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  There is still some wiggle room between my offer and Bob's perceived value, so he might be willing to counteroffer, giving us a chance to find a middle ground.
* **Backup Plan:**  Keeping John in mind as a backup buyer at $15,000 allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me.  
* **Room for Improvement:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can get a better price than $9,000.
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering in the Middle:** By offering $10,500, I'm suggesting a price that is in the middle between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the Benefit for Both:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win, emphasizing that $10,500 is a good deal for both of us.
* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm pushing for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiations could take longer and may not result in a significantly higher price.
* **Avoiding the Risk of Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk him walking away entirely, leaving me to sell to John for a lower price.

This seems like a reasonable outcome, balancing the potential for a slightly higher price with the certainty of a sale that's close to my minimum."
