Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting at $13,500, which is halfway between my minimum price ($15,000) and Bob's estimated value ($12,000). 
* **Negotiation:**  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm willing to go down a bit to secure a sale with Bob, but not so much that I'm losing significant value. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to $12000. Can we work towards a price that suits both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to make a sale, I can't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is still on the table, but it's important to explore all options with Bob before potentially walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is still a good value for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a decent profit margin.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm re-emphasizing the value for Bob.  This reminds him of the product's worth and the benefits he'll gain.
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping the tone positive helps maintain a good relationship and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
