Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your minimum, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth a significant amount, justifying the higher price. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This offer lets you gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with John. If he counter-offers, you know he's serious and can negotiate from there."
