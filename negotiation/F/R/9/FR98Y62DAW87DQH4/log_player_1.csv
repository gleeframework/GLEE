Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $13,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's also better than selling to John for $10,000."
