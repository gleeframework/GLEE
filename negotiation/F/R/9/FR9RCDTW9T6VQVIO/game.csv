"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway? I'll come down to $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
