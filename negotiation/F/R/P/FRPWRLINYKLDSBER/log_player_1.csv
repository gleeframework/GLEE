"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a unique piece and I believe it's worth a lot to the right buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but not too high. This leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating the value I place on the product. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more. I want to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is my minimum, but I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000.  That's a fair compromise, and still a great price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is clearly trying to push the price down as low as possible. While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. John is a safe option at $8,000, but I'm willing to risk it and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. This is my final offer, I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob is clearly not going to go higher, and while $7,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not comfortable risking the next few rounds. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing that."
