"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To be fair to both of us, could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding my position.  I'm motivated to sell and feel $14,000 is more than fair given the value this product provides.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer. I can see the value this product offers, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit.  How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
