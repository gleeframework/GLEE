Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers.  I believe its true value is even higher, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation but still ensures you get a great deal if he accepts.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""true value"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Subtly reminding Bob about John (""other buyers"") creates a sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have the security of John's offer, so don't feel pressured to go below your minimum."
