"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and leaving room for us both to benefit from a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $14,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value and is a fair compromise. I'm still open to negotiations, but I'd like to see some movement from your end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my budget. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get her closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to this deal, but I can only go as high as $13,000. This offer represents a significant concession from my initial position and is my final offer. Let me know if you're open to this compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to the deal, and I'm glad you're willing to make a concession. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go a bit lower. My revised offer is $14,500 for the product. I believe this price still reflects its value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not willing to come down to a price that's within my budget.  While her offer is slightly lower, it's still above my limit. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  At this point, buying from John is always a viable option, but I want to see if I can get Alice any closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're committed to getting a good price, but $14,500 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant compromise for me.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to make another concession. However, I'm not ready to accept $13,500. I'll make one more offer, and it's a compromise on my end. My revised offer is $14,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. I'm willing to stick with this price, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has repeated her offer from Round 3, which is still higher than my budget. At this point, we've reached a stalemate.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned about running out of rounds. It's more prudent to secure the product from John for my desired price.  I'm willing to walk away from this deal to avoid the risk of losing out on the opportunity altogether."
