"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and leaving room for us both to benefit from a successful deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $14,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value and is a fair compromise. I'm still open to negotiations, but I'd like to see some movement from your end.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to this deal, but I can only go as high as $13,000. This offer represents a significant concession from my initial position and is my final offer. Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to the deal, and I'm glad you're willing to make a concession. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go a bit lower. My revised offer is $14,500 for the product. I believe this price still reflects its value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're committed to getting a good price, but $14,500 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant compromise for me.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to make another concession. However, I'm not ready to accept $13,500. I'll make one more offer, and it's a compromise on my end. My revised offer is $14,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. I'm willing to stick with this price, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,7,
