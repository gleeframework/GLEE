Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and leaving room for us both to benefit from a successful deal.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This offer represents a significant concession from my initial position and is my final offer. Let me know if you're open to this compromise.

Round 6
