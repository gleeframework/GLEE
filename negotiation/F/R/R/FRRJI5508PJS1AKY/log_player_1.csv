Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, as that's your guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your backup price might entice Bob while still giving you a great return. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower price than waiting for John."
