"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win situation.
* **Message:** A friendly and encouraging tone is used to establish a positive rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
 
I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible, while also leaving space for negotiation in case Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low to even consider at this stage. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:**  This price is a significant compromise from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate.  It's still above Bob's perceived value, giving me some room to potentially bargain further.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone while making it clear that I'm not willing to accept his low offer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer again and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round. There are still several rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a good price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 6
