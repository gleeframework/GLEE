"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""product_price"": 1300000}

```

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to get a price that's closer to my ideal.  At this point, I'm starting to feel the pressure, as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a sign of my willingness to compromise.  We're running out of time, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price.  I'm hoping this is our final offer and that we can reach an agreement."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John. We are getting close to the end of the negotiations and Bob's latest offer is getting too low.  I'm not comfortable with the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob, and I don't want to risk accepting a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. John's offer, while not ideal, is at least above my minimum and guarantees me a sale."
