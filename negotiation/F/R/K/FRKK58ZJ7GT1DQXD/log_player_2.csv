"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's significantly lower than her initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation before reaching my walk-away point of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $5,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This price still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's within your budget.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit above John's price. It's worth seeing if we can push a little closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you be willing to do it for $7,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to close the gap. We're getting closer to my upper limit ($8,000), and it gives Alice a chance to propose a figure if $7,000 is too low."
