"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $5,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This price still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's within your budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you be willing to do it for $7,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,4,
