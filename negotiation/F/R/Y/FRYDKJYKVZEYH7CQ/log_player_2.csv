"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than John's price, you're still aiming to get the product for as cheap as possible. You have a few rounds left and could potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. It's a fair offer that's closer to your desired price, and it's still within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,900, which is a good price for you, considering your maximum budget of $12,000 and John's offer of $12,000. It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a slight reduction in price, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to ensure you get the product at a good price within your budget."
