"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price of $950,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,175,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $900,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
