Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. Although it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? It's still a great price for you, and it gets us both closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $9000. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still within range of my target price and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,200 is still a little too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,750? That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $8750 is a bit steep. Can you meet me at $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call.  While I'd prefer to get a bit closer to my original target price, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will walk away.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
