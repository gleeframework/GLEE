"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or even buy from John directly at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $10,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start the negotiation with a number that works for us. This leaves room for negotiation and shows Alice we're serious buyers but not willing to overpay.
* **Polite and Positive Tone:** Even though we're countering with a much lower price, we want to maintain a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $17,000 is still significantly higher than both our budget and John's offer. We have room to negotiate further, so it's worth seeing if we can get closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be open to something closer to $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Incrementally:**  We're increasing our offer, but not drastically. This shows Alice we're willing to move, but we're still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $11,500 puts us in a good spot. It's below our maximum budget, giving us some wiggle room, while still being significantly higher than our initial offer. 
* **Open-ended Question:** Asking ""would you be open to..."" keeps the negotiation flowing and encourages Alice to respond with a counter-proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate as well.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $16,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $16,000 is still too high.  It's important to hold firm, especially since Alice has labeled this as her ""final offer."" We'll see if she's willing to negotiate further or if it's time to consider John's offer more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your time. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Alice stated her last offer was final, so we're mirroring that language to create a sense of urgency.
* **Meeting Our Limit:** We're offering our absolute maximum budget. This shows Alice we're serious but unwilling to go any higher. 
* **Clear and Direct:**  We're stating our position clearly to avoid any misinterpretations. It's up to Alice now to decide if she wants to make a deal."
