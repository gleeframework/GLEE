Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes it more likely you'll get a price closer to your ideal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will be telling. If he outright rejects the offer, you know he's price-sensitive. If he counter-offers, you're in a good position to negotiate.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing you at least $8,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
