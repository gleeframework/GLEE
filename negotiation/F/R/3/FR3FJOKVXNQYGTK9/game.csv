"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While your offer is appreciated, the value of this product is significantly higher.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000. This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,150,000 is still out of my range. I'm committed to finding a deal, but I can't go above $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it reflects a fair balance of our respective needs.",900000.0,Bob,4,
