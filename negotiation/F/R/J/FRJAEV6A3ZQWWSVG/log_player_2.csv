"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even its value to her. It's best to counter-offer and start negotiating down towards a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would need to fit within a tighter budget for me to consider it. How about we bring it down to something more reasonable?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budgetary constraints. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $1,400,000 is still significantly above your budget and what you're willing to pay.  Continuing negotiations is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement, but we're still a ways off.  To be frank, I'm working with a hard limit of $1,000,000 on this.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

By putting your maximum price on the table, you're signaling the upper limit of your budget. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to accept that price or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a significant compromise on my end, considering the value this product holds. Let me know if you're willing to work with this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has made it clear that $1,200,000 is her bottom line.  Since this is still above your absolute maximum budget of $1,000,000, it's time to cut your losses and go with your backup option, John. You'll save $200,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time negotiating."
