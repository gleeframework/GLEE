"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would need to fit within a tighter budget for me to consider it. How about we bring it down to something more reasonable?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budgetary constraints. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but we're still a ways off.  To be frank, I'm working with a hard limit of $1,000,000 on this.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a significant compromise on my end, considering the value this product holds. Let me know if you're willing to work with this.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
