While $1,425,000 is a good offer, we're still in early rounds and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. I believe we can push for a higher price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

At this stage, Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but in smaller increments.  $1,430,000 is a strong price, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation stalling."
