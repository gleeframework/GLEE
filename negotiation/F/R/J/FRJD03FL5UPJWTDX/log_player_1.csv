"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my earnings. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $50 is way too low. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price to $175. This is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and try for a better price. I still have 6 rounds left before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering the price again to $160.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but still have some room to make a profit. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a price that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I have 4 rounds left and I'm hoping I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140.  This is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I still have some room to negotiate. I have only 3 rounds left and need to get closer to a deal.  I'm hoping this is an offer that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still too low for me.  I only have two rounds left and I don't think I can get him to go any higher. I'm going to sell to John and ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price."
