# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make a deal at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for less. You should try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to let it go for $100? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make a profit. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You have three options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** This is a good deal. It's still lower than what you'd pay John, and Alice is firm on her price.
2. **Reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer:**  You could try to negotiate further, but Alice has shown she's willing to walk away. You risk losing the deal entirely.
3. **Buy from John:** This is the most expensive option.

**Therefore, the best course of action is to accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $110.**"
