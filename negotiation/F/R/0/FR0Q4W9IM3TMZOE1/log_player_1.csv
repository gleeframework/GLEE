Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Bob has come up to $9,000, which is closer to my desired price and within my acceptable range. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and allows me to avoid risking a lower offer from Bob in the next round or potentially having to sell to John for $10,000."
