"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $115, which is a great deal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
