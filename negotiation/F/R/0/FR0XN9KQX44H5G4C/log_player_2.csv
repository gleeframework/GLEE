Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and dedicated support for an additional year. Considering the added value, I'm willing to meet you at $13,250. This is my final offer.
