"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. It's worth $12,000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $12,750?  It's a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to me.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,250.  Let's meet in the middle.",12250.0,Bob,4,
