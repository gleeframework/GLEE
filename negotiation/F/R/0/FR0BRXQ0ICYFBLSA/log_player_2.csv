Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. It's worth $12,000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Bob should reject the offer.  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $14,000. It's too expensive for him right now.  He can counteroffer or buy from John for a better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $12,750?  It's a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,250.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12250}
