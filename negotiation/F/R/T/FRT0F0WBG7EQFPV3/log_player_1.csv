I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident that the product is worth that to Bob given his valuation.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give up the product for less than $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering his valuation and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting too low with his offers. I'm not willing to go below $10,000. John is a guaranteed sale for that amount, so I'm going to sell to him."
