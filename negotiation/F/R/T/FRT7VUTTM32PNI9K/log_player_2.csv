{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a low price of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer and Bob's maximum budget. The goal is to start the negotiation process and gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price by rejecting and making a counteroffer. It's too early to commit to buying from John yet, as there's still potential to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is still below his maximum budget and shows that he's willing to negotiate.  He's testing the waters and gauging Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget. However, this offer is getting closer to his limit. Since there are still rounds left, Bob can try to negotiate a further reduction by rejecting and making another counteroffer. It's too early to jump to John's offer, as Bob might still get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making his final push.  He's offering his maximum budget of $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, but it aligns with his goal of saving as much money as possible.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will be forced to buy from John, so it's crucial for him to test Alice's willingness to accept his final offer."
