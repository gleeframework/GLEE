"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired value and even less than Bob's perceived value.  I'm not desperate, so I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This shows flexibility while remaining firm on my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still significantly less than what I could get from John.  I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price with Bob.  There's still time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,300,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too quickly.  I'm hoping this will make Bob think that he might need to come up with a higher offer if he wants to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While I could potentially push for a higher price, I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal. It's a good outcome, and I'm confident this is the best deal I can get at this point."
