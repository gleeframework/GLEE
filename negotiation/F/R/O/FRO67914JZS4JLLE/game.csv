"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your serious offer. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10800. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $9500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you at $9200, but I was thinking maybe we could go a bit lower. How about $9000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,6,
