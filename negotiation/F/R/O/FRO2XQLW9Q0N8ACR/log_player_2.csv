Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
