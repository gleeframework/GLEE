"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. While $850,000 is certainly a respectable offer, the true value of this product for your specific needs is considerably higher. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $910,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",910000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product has high value, but $910,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $880,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a deal.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.",880000.0,Bob,4,
