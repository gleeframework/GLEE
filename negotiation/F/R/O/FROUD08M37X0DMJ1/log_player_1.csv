"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting with a strong offer of $950,000, we aim to anchor the negotiation close to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Encouraging Dialogue:**  The message emphasizes openness to discussion and encourages Bob to share his thoughts, fostering a collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, we're still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Maintain Negotiation Power:**  Accepting his first counteroffer so quickly could signal that we are willing to concede easily.
* **Aim Higher:** We can still try to secure a price closer to our initial offer, even if it means settling slightly lower than $950,000. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  We always have the option to sell to John for our minimum acceptable price if the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. While $850,000 is certainly a respectable offer, the true value of this product for your specific needs is considerably higher. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $910,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession of $40,000 from our initial offer, demonstrating flexibility but also indicating that we're serious about getting a good price.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value *specifically* for Bob's needs, subtly anchoring the negotiation around his higher perceived value.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The language emphasizes finding a compromise, encouraging Bob to engage constructively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product has high value, but $910,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $880,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a deal.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 represents a solid deal at this stage of the negotiation. Here's why: 

* **Significant Profit:** We're still securing a profit of $80,000 above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's positioning of this offer as a ""middle ground"" is strategically smart. While not perfectly in the middle, it creates the perception of a fair compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a very good outcome."
