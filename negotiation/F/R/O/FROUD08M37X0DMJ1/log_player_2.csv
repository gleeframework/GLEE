Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. While $850,000 is certainly a respectable offer, the true value of this product for your specific needs is considerably higher. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $910,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a step down from her initial price, you're still significantly closer to your maximum than Alice is to her minimum. 
* **You have more negotiating rounds.**  The fact that you have 7 more rounds means there's still room to push for a lower price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net.** Remember, you can always buy from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice.

**Next Steps:** You'll make another counteroffer to Alice in the next round, aiming to close the gap further."
