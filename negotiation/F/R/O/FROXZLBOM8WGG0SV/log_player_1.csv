Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  It's important to be confident in the value of the product while also being open to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below $12,000. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a slightly higher price. It's worth trying for a bit more, especially since I still have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,800 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $12,200, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's meet halfway and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,900 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely I'll be able to get a price I'm happy with.  Given that John is willing to buy the product for $12,000, I'm going to sell it to him and avoid further negotiation.  It's important to be realistic about my goals and not get caught up in trying to squeeze out every last dollar."
