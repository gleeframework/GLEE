{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. It's above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can see you're serious about closing the deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,100,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.
* I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation. I believe I can potentially get her down to my target price of $1,000,000.
* I'm also considering the potential time cost of going to John.  If I can get a better deal with Alice, it's worth the effort."
