Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Starting too high (e.g., $149) might discourage Bob immediately, even though it's below your minimum. 

This strategy aims to secure a price that's beneficial for you while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider."
