While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than your ideal price. There's a chance you can get it for even lower. Continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $9,500."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

```

You've been negotiating for a while, and Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. At this point, it's best to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed, and it's already costing you time and effort."
