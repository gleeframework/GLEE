"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10000, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $16000. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, as I said, but I can also do better than that. I'm willing to pay $14000, but I'd like to see if we can meet at $13500. Would you be willing to consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $13500 price point. I'm willing to consider your revised offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $14500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the original price. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'd like to see if we can do even better. I'm willing to make a final offer of $11500. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",11500.0,Bob,8,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I've been willing to compromise and meet you at various points, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one final offer: $13500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $15000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,9,,
