"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,300,000 is a fair reflection of the product's potential, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price considers the value it brings while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I acknowledge the product's value, $1,900,000 remains outside my comfort zone.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part and represents a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
