"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept immediately.  By rejecting, you open the possibility of getting a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($120 is $30 less) is a good tactic.  It shows you're serious about negotiating and gives Alice room to compromise without feeling like they're losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  $135 is still within your budget, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether or wasting valuable rounds. It's a good compromise to accept the offer."
