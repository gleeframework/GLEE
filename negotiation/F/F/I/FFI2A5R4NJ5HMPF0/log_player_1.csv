{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above your minimum but still leaves room for a potential compromise.  It also signals that you're open to negotiation, which may encourage Bob to counteroffer rather than simply rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you can likely do better. Rejecting his offer allows you to try and reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to make this work. This is a fair price considering the value of this product to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe we can reach a fair agreement. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firmly set on his $10,000 offer, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher price.  Since John is also willing to pay $10,000, selling to John ensures a quick and certain sale."
