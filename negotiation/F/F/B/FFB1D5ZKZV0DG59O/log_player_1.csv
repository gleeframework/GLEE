Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear we are unlikely to reach a price that significantly exceeds John's standing offer. Accepting Bob's current offer would be a $50,000 loss compared to John's offer.  Continuing negotiations with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is not worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer."
