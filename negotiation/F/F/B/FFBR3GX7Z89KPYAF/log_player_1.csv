I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a price that is higher than my guaranteed value of $8,000 from John, so it gives me room to potentially make more money. 

Since I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, there is a risk he might reject the offer. However, I believe this price point balances the risk of losing the sale with the potential for a higher profit."
