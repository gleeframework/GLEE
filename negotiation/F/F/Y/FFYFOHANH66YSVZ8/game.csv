"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable at $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly. I propose we meet in the middle at $90. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to make another counteroffer.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to $88. This is a fair compromise, allowing us to move forward with the transaction while respecting the value you see in the product. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",88.0,Alice,5,
