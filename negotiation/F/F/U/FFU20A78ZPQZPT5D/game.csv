,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $10,500 is the lowest I can go.  This still gives you a good deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
