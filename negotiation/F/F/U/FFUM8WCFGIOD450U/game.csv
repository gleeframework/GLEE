"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground. ",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and respect your need for a reasonable profit. However, I am unable to agree to $11,500. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This still represents a good value for me, while allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit margin.
