"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer matches the product's baseline value for me, it's still early in the negotiation. I have room to counter and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, my initial offer reflects the significant value and potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer but shows a willingness to negotiate. This keeps the possibility of a higher profit open while acknowledging Bob's feedback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $1,300,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now moving in the right direction, but $100,000 is a significant difference. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push the price closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

I'm proposing a price directly in the middle of our current offers. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to make a similar move towards a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting very close to my baseline, and we're nearing the halfway point in the negotiation.  While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting $1,350,000 guarantees a substantial profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. It's a good compromise at this stage."
