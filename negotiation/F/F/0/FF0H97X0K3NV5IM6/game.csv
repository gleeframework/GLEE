"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to meet you halfway.  This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $875,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
