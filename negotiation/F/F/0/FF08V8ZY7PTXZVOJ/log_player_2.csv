"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fantastic price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This still provides you with a significant profit and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still offers you a significant gain while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to finalize this deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $900,000**, which is better than John's price of $1,000,000.
* **There's still some room for negotiation**, but continuing to reject offers could risk Alice walking away or increasing her price back to her initial offer.  
* **Accepting this offer secures a good price** and avoids potential risks associated with further negotiation."
