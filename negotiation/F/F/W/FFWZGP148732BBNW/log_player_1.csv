"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,500,000) but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to explore how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing the negotiation with Bob. I'm confident that I can get a higher price by countering his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $900,000 with a price of $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves significant room for profit. I'm hoping that Bob, who clearly sees the value of the product, will be willing to meet me halfway."
