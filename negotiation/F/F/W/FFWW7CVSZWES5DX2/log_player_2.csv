"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can come to a fair deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to save $2,000 compared to John's price, Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  He can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm looking to spend a bit less though. How about $11,500? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking for a bit more. Let's meet in the middle at $12,250. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, there's still room to negotiate. He can counteroffer again and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,250 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Let's try $11,750. That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $12,000? That's a fair price for the product and gives us both room to be happy with the deal.  Let's find common ground here.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's now at a price of $12,000, which is significantly lower than John's offer of $15,000. While he might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and they might not reach a deal in the remaining rounds.  It's time to secure the deal and save $3,000."
