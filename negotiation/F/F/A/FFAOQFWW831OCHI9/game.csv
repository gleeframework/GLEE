"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you have a budget, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $7,000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $11,000?  That's a significant reduction on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $8,000?  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
