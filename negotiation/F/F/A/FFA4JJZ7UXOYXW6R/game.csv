"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
