"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is appealing, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise, recognizing the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,350,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a fair compromise for both of us and allows me to secure the product while staying within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer at a higher price point.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to significantly reduce my price to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a substantial compromise and reflects the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
