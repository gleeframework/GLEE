Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, vaguely alluding to the product's value (""Given its value..."") might pique Bob's interest and make him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""What do you think?"",  you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation, increasing your chances of getting a price closer to your ideal.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know you have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, so use that as your safety net."
