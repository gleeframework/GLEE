Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value,""  Alice subtly hints at the product's worth beyond just a number.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's feedback and potential counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While Alice knows John will buy at $10,000, she shouldn't reveal this to Bob.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer sets the stage. Alice should be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and she'll need to decide how low she's willing to go."
