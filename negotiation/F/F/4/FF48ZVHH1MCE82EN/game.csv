"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to offer the product for $9,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is the lowest I can go, but I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $8,750 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a final offer from my end. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really struggling to justify spending more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,6,
