"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and still allows for a good profit for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

While $950,000 is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially negotiate a better price. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and still allows for a good profit for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

While $925,000 is tempting, you're getting closer to your maximum budget.  It's likely that further negotiations with Alice will be difficult and time-consuming.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000 and secure the deal."
