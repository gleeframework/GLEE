Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation but signals my serious intentions.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, making it clear that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm ready to hold firm if his offer is too low. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me confidence to be assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows his interest in the product. I can use this opportunity to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 provides me with leverage to hold firm during negotiations with Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him to justify my counteroffer and encourage him to see the potential return on his investment.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains positive and encouraging, aiming to maintain a good rapport with Bob and keep the negotiations moving forward.

By counteroffering at $1,050,000, I'm aiming to close the gap while still securing a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer remains a strong alternative:** I have the option to sell to John for a price significantly higher than what Bob is offering. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:** I can use the leverage of John's offer to push for a price closer to my desired range.

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price that's closer to my target. I'll likely counter with a price between $1,000,000 and $1,050,000, leaving space for further negotiation while still being above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $980,000 is still significantly below the value this product offers you. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and firmness:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm in my position.
* **Reiterating value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he will gain by investing in it.
* **Positive and proactive:** The message encourages further negotiation and aims to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.

By offering $1,020,000, I'm hoping to find a compromise that satisfies both of our needs and avoids the need to sell to John, which would ultimately give me a higher profit but potentially limit future opportunities with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to make some adjustments to fit within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $990,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** While Bob's offer is higher than previous rounds, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer is significantly better:** I can secure a much higher price by selling to John, which would be a significant financial gain.
* **Time is a factor:** Further negotiation could potentially take longer, and I may not reach a price that satisfies my minimum requirement. 

Selling to John guarantees me the highest profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities, even if it means missing out on a potential future deal with Bob."
