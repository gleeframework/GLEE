"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can we try $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $95 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $98 is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll take the product.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $92 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $95. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have no choice but to sell to another buyer.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go up to $91, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll take the product.",91.0,Bob,8,
