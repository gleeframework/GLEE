Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my minimum price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $95 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price.  I'm not sure if Bob will budge further, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $95 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $98 is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 98}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll take the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. With only 4 rounds left, I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $92 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $95. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have no choice but to sell to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go up to $91, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll take the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation has stalled.  Bob's final offer of $91 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120, and I don't have enough time to try to get a higher price.  It's better to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $120."
