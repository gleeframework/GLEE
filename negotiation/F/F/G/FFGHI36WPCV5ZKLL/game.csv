"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to your business. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount from its true value, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
