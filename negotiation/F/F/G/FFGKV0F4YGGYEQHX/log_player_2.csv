# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is a good one, but you can still try to get a better deal. If you reject her offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or she might propose a better offer.  If she doesn't, you can always fall back on buying from John for $1,200,000."
