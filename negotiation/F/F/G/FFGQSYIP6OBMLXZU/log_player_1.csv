Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chance of a sale.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed to sell it to John for $120. This means any price Bob accepts above $120 is pure profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having a secure fallback option with John."
