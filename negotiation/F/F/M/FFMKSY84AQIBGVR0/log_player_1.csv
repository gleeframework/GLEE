""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your business, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential for a strong return on investment. I'm confident we can find mutually beneficial terms."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering your minimum acceptable price. While there might be room for negotiation upwards, it's risky. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price. It makes the most sense to take the sure thing and sell to John."
