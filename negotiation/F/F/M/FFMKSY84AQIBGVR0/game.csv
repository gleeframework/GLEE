"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
