"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9000 is simply too far below what I need to sell for.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500? This would give you a good deal and allow me to move forward with the sale.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. Can you consider this revised offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
