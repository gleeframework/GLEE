Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's lower than your minimum of $15,000, so if he rejects, you have room to go up without going below your minimum.
* **It's a good starting point:**  It's a good starting point that allows for both sides to negotiate. 

Remember, negotiation is a back and forth. If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer. You always have the option to sell to John if you're not happy with Bob's counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's good that Bob is interested, but $9,000 is still too low. It's important to remember that you value the product at $15,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too far below what I need to sell for.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would give you a good deal and allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still below your ideal price, it's a good compromise. You've successfully negotiated a price closer to your minimum and you're likely to avoid the hassle of further negotiations. Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but the risk of further rounds with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price is worth taking."
