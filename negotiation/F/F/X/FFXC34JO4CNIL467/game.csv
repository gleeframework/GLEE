"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from that price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This would give us both a good deal.  What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $10,750? This is a fair price that gives us both some room to make a deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above $10,750. Would you consider $11,000? This would be a fair price that gets us closer to an agreement, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
