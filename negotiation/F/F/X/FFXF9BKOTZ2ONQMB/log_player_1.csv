Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 2250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still potentially land above your minimum. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $2,250,000, you're anchoring the negotiation at a higher point. Even though Bob's valuation is lower, this starting point might make him more receptive to offers in the $1,750,000 - $2,000,000 range.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you have John as a backup. This gives you the power to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it leaves no room for negotiation. You started high for a reason. Rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a better deal, even if it's just slightly above $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While a large drop from the initial offer, it shows willingness to negotiate and lands firmly above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and limit further back-and-forth.  Bob needs to decide if the product is worth it to him at this price.
* **John Leverage:** Remember, you still have the safety net of selling to John at your minimum price. This allows you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, I am still not able to meet the price of $2,000,000. I would like to make one last counteroffer of $1,750,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to push for more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer secures a substantial gain.
