,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $9,500 is below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",10800.0,Bob,4,
