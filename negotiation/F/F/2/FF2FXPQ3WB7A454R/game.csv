"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500.  Would you be open to that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $7,500, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target of $9,500. I can offer you the product for $8,800. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm still quite interested in the product but  $8,800 is a bit too high for me. How about $7,750? I feel like that's a fair offer that would let us both benefit from this deal.",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I can offer you the product for $8,900. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum target. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I appreciate that this is your final offer, but I can't go above $8,000.  That's a firm limit for me, but it would be a great way to close this deal out.  What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,8,
