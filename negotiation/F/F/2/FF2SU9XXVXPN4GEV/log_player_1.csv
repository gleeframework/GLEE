While we could try to push for more, accepting $990,000 is a strong win. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's a substantial profit above your minimum ($990,000 vs. $800,000).
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a potentially slightly higher offer risks losing this deal.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a great price and avoids potential downsides."
