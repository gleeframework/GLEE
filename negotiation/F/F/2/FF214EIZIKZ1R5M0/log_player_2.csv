"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than its value to her, it's significantly more than your maximum price and what John offers.  You can save a considerable amount of money ($4,000) by going with John."
