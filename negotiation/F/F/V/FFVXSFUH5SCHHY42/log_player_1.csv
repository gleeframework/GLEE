Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum price. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price if necessary, or I can always go to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility on my end, but also establishes a firm bottom line. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable going that low.  I've already come down a good bit from my initial offer, and I'm confident that John will be happy to purchase the product at my minimum price.  It's time to move on and secure a sale that meets my financial goals."
