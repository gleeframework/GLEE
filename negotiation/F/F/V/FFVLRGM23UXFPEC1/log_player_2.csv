Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget. He should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 105 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down further to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 98. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation.  It's unlikely she'll come down further.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, so it's the best choice at this point."
