"Alice, your offer is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is my maximum offer, as I can purchase a similar product from John for that price.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique aspects and benefits this product offers compared to others on the market. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the true value you'll be receiving.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the unique aspects of this product, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This price is still significantly less than your original offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
