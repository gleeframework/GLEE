"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum valuation.  You should definitely reject and counter-offer with a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we start at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's still within the realm of possibility for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, you're setting an anchor for the negotiation. Even if Alice doesn't agree to $8,000, it makes it more likely she'll be willing to come down further than if you started with a higher counteroffer.
* **Leaves Room to Negotiate:**  There's a big gap between $8,000 and your $12,000 maximum. This leaves room for you to negotiate upwards if needed, while still trying to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Your Limit:** Alice has come down, but $14,000 is still more than your $12,000 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her ""meeting halfway"" comment suggests she might be open to moving closer to your range.

It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting a Fair Compromise:** We're aiming for a price that's closer to the midpoint between your $12,000 maximum and Alice's revised offer of $14,000. 
* **Maintaining Negotiation Pressure:** While moving closer to Alice's price, we're still negotiating firmly and not simply accepting her ""halfway"" point.
* **Leaving a Small Buffer:**  Offering $11,000 leaves a little room to go up slightly if absolutely necessary, while still staying under your $12,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to earn a decent profit. I'll offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Your Limit:** Alice is now at $13,000, which is only $1,000 away from your absolute maximum of $12,000. She's also signaled that this is her final offer.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000. 

While there's a small chance you *might* be able to squeeze a few hundred dollars more out of Alice, it's a risky gamble. It's more prudent to take the sure thing from John and save the $1,000."
