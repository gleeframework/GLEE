"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,312,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1312500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,312,500 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,318,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a profitable deal for both of us.",1318750.0,Alice,5,
