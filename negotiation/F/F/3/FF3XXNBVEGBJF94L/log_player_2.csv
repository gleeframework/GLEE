Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.
