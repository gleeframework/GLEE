"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,250. Let me know if that works for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm willing to come down a bit further to make this deal work.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $8,800? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8800.0,Bob,6,
