"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000, recognizing the value you see in it.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price. However, $1300000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1325000.

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is closer to my desired price, I still need to maintain a certain value for this product.  I'm willing to come down just a little further to $1310000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.
