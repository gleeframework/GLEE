"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15000 to both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the same product from John for $15,000, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should use this opportunity to counteroffer and try to get a lower price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $15000 is simply too low for me to let this product go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16500. This would still allow me to recoup a good portion of the product's value while ensuring we can both be happy with the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still get the product from John for $15,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to bring the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $16,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 16000}
