"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and gauge his interest level."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer is good, and I'm not sure I can get much more. I'm happy to accept and secure the sale."
