You have three options:

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This counteroffer is your maximum price, and it's equal to the price John is willing to sell for.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and make a sale or reject and risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. Since you already have a deal in place with John for $1,000,000, it's more beneficial to go with that option."
