"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I like that you're willing to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm getting a bit anxious to sell this product, so I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",8500.0,Alice,5,
