"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than my actual budget ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting low, I signal to Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but need her to meet me closer to my price range.  

This strategy aims to encourage Alice to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still $1,000 over my budget. I'm going to push a little further and see if I can get closer to $8,000.  It's worth another round of negotiation before I settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Budget:** I'm increasing my offer to $7,500, which is getting closer to my $8,000 limit.
* **Finding a Compromise:** By suggesting ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm emphasizing fairness and encouraging Alice to find a price we can both agree on.
* **Still Below John's Offer:**  I'm staying below John's $8,000 offer, keeping that option open if Alice doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like that you're willing to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm getting a bit anxious to sell this product, so I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge further:** Alice is holding firm at $8,500 and expressing urgency to sell. This suggests she's not likely to go much lower.
* **John's offer is better:** John's offer of $8,000 is now a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice, who seems unlikely to meet my budget.

While I could try to negotiate Alice down another $500, it's not guaranteed, and the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
