"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that much. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700000. I'm willing to consider a price between $1000000 and $1500000. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to consider a price between $1000000 and $1500000, but I'm still a bit above that range. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go down to $900000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $900000, which would be $1075000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not willing to pay $1075000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",850000.0,Bob,6,
