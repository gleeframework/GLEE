"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise I'll be selling it to John for $1,000,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is below your maximum budget ($1,200,000), but it's still a significant markup from her value ($1,000,000).
* Alice's statement about selling to John for $1,000,000 is likely a bluff to pressure you. It doesn't make sense for her to sell for less than your offer. 
* By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff and signal you're willing to walk away. There's a good chance she'll come back with a lower price closer to her actual value. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Alice won't negotiate further and will sell to someone else. However, given the information provided, the potential savings from a better offer outweigh this risk."
