"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I know you'll recognize its immense value.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This classic negotiation tactic allows room for me to come down during the rounds while gauging Bob's interest and potential counter-offers. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high initial price, even without revealing specific details. 
* **Leaving John as Leverage:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 gives me a strong position. I'm not pressured to accept low offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $800,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant jump from his initial perceived value. This indicates strong interest and room for negotiation. While I could take the $100,000 profit now, I believe I can secure a better deal by countering.  I'm willing to negotiate down, but not to a point where the profit is insignificant compared to my alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While $1,300,000 represents its true worth in my eyes, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's consider $1,150,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's quality and exclusivity while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and meet Bob somewhere in the middle.
* **Anchoring:**  By framing my initial price as the ""true worth,"" I'm maintaining a strong anchor point. This might influence Bob's perception of a ""fair"" price.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** This counteroffer still secures a substantial profit margin above both my minimum and Bob's stated value. 
* **Open for Continued Negotiation:** The language emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" signaling that I'm open to further discussion and potential adjustments in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's exclusivity and quality. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a strong deal for me. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price point secures a $50,000 profit above my guaranteed offer from John.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating a serious intent to purchase. His willingness to meet ""halfway"" indicates he's likely near his maximum price. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further increases the risk of Bob walking away or me missing out on a good deal.  Closing now guarantees the profit.

While I could push for a slightly higher price in the next round, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
