"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While $1,300,000 represents its true worth in my eyes, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's consider $1,150,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's quality and exclusivity while acknowledging your initial offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's exclusivity and quality.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
