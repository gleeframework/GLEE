"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway once, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1250000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1225000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
