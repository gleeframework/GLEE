"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer and your current one. I can offer you a price of $10000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
