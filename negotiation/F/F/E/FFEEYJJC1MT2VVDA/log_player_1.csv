"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""immense potential"" and ""significant benefits,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of value at a higher level, even if he ultimately negotiates the price down.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $2,250,000 leaves considerable room for negotiation before reaching John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase this product. While I appreciate its value, I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's price, it's still early in the negotiation.  Rejecting now allows me to gauge if Bob is willing to go higher and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, my initial asking price considered the true value and potential this product holds for your business. To find a compromise, I'm willing to lower the price to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** It's good practice to acknowledge Bob's counteroffer, showing you're engaging in the negotiation seriously. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Significant Drop, but Room to Negotiate:** Dropping by $250,000 is a significant move that signals a willingness to negotiate. However, it still leaves room to go lower before reaching John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate. We're getting closer to my minimum, but I still have room to push for a better deal. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you halfway, let's settle on $1,875,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** Acknowledging Bob's progress (""you're getting closer"") encourages him to continue negotiating.
* **Compromise:** Suggesting to ""meet halfway"" frames this offer as a fair solution.
* **Final Offer Hint:**  By stating ""this is a very competitive offer,"" I'm subtly implying this is a strong final offer without explicitly saying it. This could prompt Bob to accept or counter with a number very close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in lowering the price, Alice. I believe we can reach an agreement that is fair for both parties. My counteroffer is $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and a good deal overall. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has been steadily increasing his offers, and we're now in a good range. Accepting avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling negotiations.
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Securing a deal now is preferable to risking a stalemate or a lower offer in later rounds."
