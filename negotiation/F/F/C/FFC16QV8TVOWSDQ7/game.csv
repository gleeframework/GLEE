"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $10500. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'll counter with a price of $10750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to pay a premium, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'll counter with a price of $10900. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, and I think this price is a good compromise. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm starting to think about buying from John, but I'd still like to try to make a deal with you. Can you meet me at $9800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
