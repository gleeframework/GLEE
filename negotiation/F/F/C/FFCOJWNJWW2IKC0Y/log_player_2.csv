Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. This price is still fair considering the value of the product and my other potential buyer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit short of what I need. I'm prepared to make one final concession and offer the product for $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.  If you're serious about buying, this is our best offer.

It's time to cut your losses and go with John. Alice is unwilling to come down to your price range, and her final offer is still above your budget. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
