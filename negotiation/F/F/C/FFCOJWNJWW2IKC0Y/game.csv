"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I have another seller willing to sell for $800,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. This price is still fair considering the value of the product and my other potential buyer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to make the purchase. Otherwise, I'll have to go with my other option.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit short of what I need. I'm prepared to make one final concession and offer the product for $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.  If you're serious about buying, this is our best offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
