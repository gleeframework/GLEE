"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
