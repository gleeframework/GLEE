"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $110. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $102? I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
