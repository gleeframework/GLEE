"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. Given its value and quality, it's an excellent opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. Don't hesitate to make your decision soon! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Because you can buy the product for $100 from John, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed with buying from John."
