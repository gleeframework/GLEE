"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500.  This is a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for just a little more than what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
