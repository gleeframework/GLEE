Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation and Bob's offers are still too low for me.  While I would prefer to get more, John's offer is above my minimum and will allow me to close the deal quickly."
