"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500.  I'm still a little hesitant to go that high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
