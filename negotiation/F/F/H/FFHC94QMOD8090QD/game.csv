"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try to find a sweet spot. How about we compromise at $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,550,000 is closer, but I need to stay under $1,400,000 for this to make sense. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's make a deal at $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
