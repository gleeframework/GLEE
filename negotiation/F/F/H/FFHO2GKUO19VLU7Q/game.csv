"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $10,500. How about we try to find a price that's closer to $9,000, but not as low as my initial offer? What if we meet at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,150. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $9,500.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $9,750. It's a small compromise, and I think it's the best we can do to reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $9,750 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'll propose $9,625. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",9625.0,Bob,8,
