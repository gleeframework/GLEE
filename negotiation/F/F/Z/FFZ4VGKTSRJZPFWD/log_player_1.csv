Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay more, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for compromise:** You can potentially go higher if Bob is close to accepting, but you still have a good fallback with John. 

By offering a price slightly above your minimum, you signal that you're serious about selling, but also that you're willing to negotiate. This approach is more likely to lead to a successful sale."
