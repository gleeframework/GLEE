Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and higher than what Bob values it at ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the absolute maximum ($100) because I want to give Bob some incentive to bargain.
* **Being friendly:** Starting with a friendly greeting can make Bob more receptive to the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:**  Depending on Bob's response, I will either accept a counteroffer (if it's close to my minimum) or make a counteroffer (if it's too low).
* **John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Opportunity to improve:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  While selling to John for $100 is a safe option, I'd prefer to maximize my profit if possible.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:**  I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my minimum:**  $95 is closer to my minimum of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin. 
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  Staying friendly can help keep the negotiation positive and productive. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response and either accept his offer if it's close enough, or make another counteroffer if necessary. 
* **John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome:** It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly from this point.
* **Selling to John is the most profitable option:**  By selling to John for $100, I can secure a profit that's higher than what I'd get from accepting Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:**  I will finalize the sale with John to ensure a quick and profitable transaction."
