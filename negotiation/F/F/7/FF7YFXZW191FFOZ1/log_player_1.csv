Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is well above my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
