"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's best to reject and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is well above my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the inherent worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I will continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,400,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise. This allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right that $1,400,000 is closer to a fair deal.  However, I need to see a bit more movement to make this work on my end.  I'm proposing $1,500,000.  This represents a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is within my budget and represents a significant concession from her previous offer. While I would ideally pay less, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance Alice might further reduce her price, but there's also a chance she'll become unwilling to negotiate and I'll end up paying more if I choose to buy from John. It's time to secure this deal."
