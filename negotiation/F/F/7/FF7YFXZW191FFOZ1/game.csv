"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is well above my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the inherent worth of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,400,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise. This allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that $1,400,000 is closer to a fair deal.  However, I need to see a bit more movement to make this work on my end.  I'm proposing $1,500,000.  This represents a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
