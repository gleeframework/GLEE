"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $145 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $135? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",135.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $138.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd really like to make this deal happen.",138.0,Bob,4,
