"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm willing to come down from my minimum price. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $10,500? This gives you a good price while still allowing me to make a profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
