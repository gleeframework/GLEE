"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $170 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to buy it for $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my original offer of $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $120, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $120, which would be $132.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",132.5,Alice,5,
