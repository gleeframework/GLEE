"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This initial counteroffer also sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  There's still a significant difference between $14,000 and Bob's maximum of $15,000, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice that he is serious about buying but still wants a good deal.  By offering $13,000, Bob is now only $1,000 away from Alice's latest offer, creating a strong incentive for her to accept."
