"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Even though Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000, Alice's offer of $950,000 saves Bob $50,000.
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so even at $950,000, he's getting a good deal."
