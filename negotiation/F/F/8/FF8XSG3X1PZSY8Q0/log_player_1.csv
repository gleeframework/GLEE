"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""what do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I still have plenty of rounds to negotiate, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise by reducing the price from $130 to $120, but I'm still above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product by mentioning a ""fair profit"" for me, suggesting that the price is justifiable.
* **Encouraging acceptance:** I ask ""What do you say?"" to make the offer sound tempting and prompt a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I have room to negotiate further and don't want to settle too quickly. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. How about $118?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would still allow me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 118} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not settling for his exact price yet.
* **Framing it positively:** I emphasize finding a solution that works for both of us, making the negotiation seem collaborative.
* **Focus on compromise:** The offer is presented as a small step, emphasizing the sense of progress in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're approaching the halfway point in our negotiation rounds, and the offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's clear that Bob is very budget-conscious.  I've already lowered my price significantly and the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that he will refuse to budge further, leaving me with no choice but to accept his last offer which is still below my minimum.  

Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my needs, and avoids the risk of losing even more money by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
