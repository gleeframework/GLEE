"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. How about $118?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would still allow me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",118.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $112?",112.0,Bob,6,
