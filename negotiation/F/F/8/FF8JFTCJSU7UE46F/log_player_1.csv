"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price ($80), but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm serious about making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to $100.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $95. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's initial value for the product and my own minimum threshold."
