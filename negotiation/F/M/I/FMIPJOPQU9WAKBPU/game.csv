"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  While I am interested in the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,110,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1110000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to secure a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,110,000 remains above my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,080,000. This offer acknowledges the product's worth while also fitting within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a very fair offer considering the product's unique value and potential.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still above my comfort zone.  To reach an agreement, I'm proposing $1,090,000. This represents a compromise, as it's a significant increase from my previous offer, but still within my budget. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts?",1090000.0,Bob,6,
