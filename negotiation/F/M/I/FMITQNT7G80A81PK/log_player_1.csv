Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price means more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($11,500) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a firm offer, the slight discount from John's price leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to capitalize on the potential for a higher profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
