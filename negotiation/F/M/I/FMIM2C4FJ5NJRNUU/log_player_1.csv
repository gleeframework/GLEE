"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $100 is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* This first offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* It leaves open the possibility of reducing the price slightly in the next rounds if necessary. 
* It's important to remember the value of the product to me is $120. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell it for less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **I'll counteroffer.** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll likely offer a price slightly above Bob's, showing I'm willing to compromise but still valuing the product.

**Strategy:**

* **Staying firm:** I need to protect my profit margin and ensure I don't sell below my minimum.
* **Counteroffer to test the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to budge. If not, I can still sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $90, which is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product. It also frames $90 as a ""great deal,"" making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Staying above the minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum price of $120, so I'm not losing money. 
* **Testing the waters:** I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to come up slightly. 
* **Preparing for the next round:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating with him or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85, can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While I appreciate his willingness to compromise, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **I'm willing to continue negotiating, but not at the risk of losing money.** I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiating aggressively:**  I need to be firm in my stance, but also demonstrate flexibility.  
* **Assessing risk:**  If Bob rejects my next counteroffer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $120.

**Next steps:** I'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round that's close enough to Bob's offer to entice him, but still above my minimum price. I might try offering $88 or $89 to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's split the difference. How about $87? It's a fair price that values the product but also fits your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $87, which is halfway between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows I'm committed to finding a solution. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes my desire to find a fair price for both of us. I frame it as a ""split the difference"" solution, which can be persuasive. 

**Strategy:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm taking a bigger step towards Bob's price, hoping to create urgency for him to accept.
* **Protecting my minimum:** $87 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Preparing for the final rounds:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to make a tough decision in the next round. If I don't sell to Bob, I'll have to sell to John and walk away with less profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $87 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $82.50, can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  While I appreciate his willingness to compromise, $82.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **There's not enough time to negotiate further.**  I've already made several concessions, and I'm running out of rounds. I don't want to risk selling the product for less than my minimum and potentially lose out on a better deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Protecting my profit:** I'm prioritizing my own financial interests and ensuring I don't sell the product at a loss.
* **Cutting my losses:**  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, selling to John for $120 is a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Final decision:** I've decided to sell the product to John for $120.  It's not the ideal price, but it's the best outcome given the current situation."
