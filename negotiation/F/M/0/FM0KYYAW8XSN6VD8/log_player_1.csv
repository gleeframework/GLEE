Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, but that's as low as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

It's getting close to the point where further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. Taking the $17,000 is better than risking Bob walking away and getting only $15,000 from John."
