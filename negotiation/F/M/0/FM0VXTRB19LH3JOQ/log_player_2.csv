"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. Since Bob's maximum price is $150, he has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $125?  I'm really interested in this product, but that's my top price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth it at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $132.50 is still within Bob's budget and is closer to his desired price than John's offer. Accepting the offer allows Bob to save money compared to buying from John."
