"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for my budget right now. Would you consider $500,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into developing it.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $700,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $600,000?  That feels like a good compromise to me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the effort we've put into developing it.",650000.0,Alice,5,
