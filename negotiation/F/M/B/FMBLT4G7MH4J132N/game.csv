"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in your product, but $1450000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1300000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1400000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is still a bit above where I'm comfortable, but I'm happy to meet you halfway.  I'd be willing to offer $1350000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
