"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500?  That's a fair price, and we can close the deal today.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
