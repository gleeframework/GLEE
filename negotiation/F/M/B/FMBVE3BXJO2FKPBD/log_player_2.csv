"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. You're willing to spend no more than $10,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your $10,000 limit. You have more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $12,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price of $12250. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. We've already negotiated for a few rounds, and it seems like Alice is not willing to go lower than $12,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $10,000 to ensure you get the product within your budget.  The potential for further negotiation with Alice isn't worth the risk of going over your limit."
