"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""unique potential"" and ""true worth,"" I'm framing the product as a premium item, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I aim for the highest possible price, I'm aware of John's guaranteed offer. This knowledge allows me to negotiate confidently, knowing I have a strong alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum and my alternative offer from John. Rejecting gives me the opportunity to negotiate further and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price, but it's still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while reinforcing the product's value.
* **Maintaining a Strong Stance:**  I'm not dropping my price too drastically, as I want to avoid anchoring the negotiation too close to Bob's offer.
* **Time Consideration:**  With seven rounds remaining, I have room to negotiate further if needed. I'm aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement without rushing the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my means. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm offering $1,400,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to my guaranteed offer from John, but there's still room for negotiation. His offer is above his perceived value, showing he's willing to stretch, and I'm betting I can get him closer to $1,500,000 with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,400,000 is a significant offer, but it doesn't fully reflect the value this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let's settle at $1,650,000 and close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This demonstrates fairness and a willingness to compromise while keeping the price well above John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing to ""close this deal,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without resorting to hardball tactics. 
* **Targeting Above Target:**  My ideal outcome is to secure a deal closer to $1,650,000. By aiming slightly above my fallback option (John's offer), I increase my chances of landing in a favorable position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference between our last offers. I'm offering $1,525,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is now higher than John's guaranteed $1,500,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Securing the Deal:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a favorable outcome, whereas continued negotiation introduces uncertainty."
