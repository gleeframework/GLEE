"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my means. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm offering $1,400,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to this deal. ",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,400,000 is a significant offer, but it doesn't fully reflect the value this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let's settle at $1,650,000 and close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference between our last offers. I'm offering $1,525,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
