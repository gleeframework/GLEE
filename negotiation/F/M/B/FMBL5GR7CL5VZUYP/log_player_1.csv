"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counter-offer. This allows me to start the negotiation at a point where I can potentially make a significant profit. I'll keep John in mind as a backup option, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $850,000 is closer to my desired range, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $875,000.

I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
