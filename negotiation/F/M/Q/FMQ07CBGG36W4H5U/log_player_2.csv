"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $120 from John, so you should aim for a lower price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer of $100 allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90 as a counteroffer. This is still a good deal for Alice as it's above her value of $80.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while still saving me money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within my budget of $120, and it's a better price than buying from John.  There's a chance I could get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer again, or I might end up paying more. It's better to take the offer now and secure the product within my budget."
