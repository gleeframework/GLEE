"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value I place on the product, I understand you have a budget in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really aiming for $12,000, which is my absolute limit. I know you value the product highly, but I hope you'll consider my offer.  ",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position on the price. Let's make this work - how about $14,000? This is a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product,  $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? It's a compromise that would allow us both to make a deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
