"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality. However, $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to purchase it for $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I would like to suggest a compromise. How about we set the price at $95? This still reflects the value we place on the product while being more accommodating to your budget. Please let me know if this works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $95 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend. Would you be willing to come down to $85? I'm confident this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
