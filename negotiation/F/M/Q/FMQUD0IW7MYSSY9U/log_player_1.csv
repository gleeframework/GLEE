Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $120 might seem too aggressive and could lead to Bob rejecting it outright. 

By starting high but reasonable, Alice increases her chances of securing a sale close to Bob's maximum valuation."
