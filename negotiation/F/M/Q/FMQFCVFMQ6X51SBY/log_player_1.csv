Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is closer to my minimum value than Bob's maximum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for some potential negotiation and gives Bob a sense that there's room for compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but also ready to accept John's offer of $1,200,000 if Bob doesn't come close enough to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While it's a step up from his initial value, $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, leaving some space for compromise but ensuring I don't settle for too little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $1,150,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't undervalue the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone in my message, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm confident that $1,150,000 is a reasonable compromise.  If he continues to refuse, I'll be ready to accept John's offer and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is the highest I am willing to go, considering the value of the product to me. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While tempting, it's still below my target.
* **John's Offer is More Lucrative:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 guarantees me a better outcome and meets my minimum value requirement.
* **Time is Valuable:**  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a higher price, but it also risks prolonging the process and potentially losing John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

Since John's offer ensures a higher profit and a quicker deal, I'll accept his offer and move on. This decision allows me to secure my desired value and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
