**Reasoning:**

Bob seems unwilling to meet Alice's price point. He's gone back to his previous offer of $1,320,000, signaling he may not be willing to move much higher.  Since Alice has a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, continuing with Bob has a downside risk with minimal potential upside. It's strategically sound to cut negotiations and take John's offer."
