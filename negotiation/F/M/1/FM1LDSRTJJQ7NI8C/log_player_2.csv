"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm asking for $95, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm not sure I agree with Alice's valuation of the product's worth to me. I think it's worth no more than $80. Her offer of $95 is too high. I'll reject her offer.
