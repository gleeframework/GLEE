"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll be getting a good price for it. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy the product for $10500. This price is still fair for you, as it's above your valuation, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11000 to make this worthwhile.  It's still a great price for you, considering it's worth more than that to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750? This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your valuation and closer to my budget. Let's make a deal!",10750.0,Bob,4,
