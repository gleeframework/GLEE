{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts by establishing a friendly tone and highlighting the value the product holds for Bob. The price is set at $130, which is a good starting point, giving you room to negotiate if needed while still making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a great deal for you considering the value this product holds. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're not willing to go as low as my previous offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $100, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to him.  I'll accept his offer."
