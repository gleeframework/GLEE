Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it matches what John is offering. There's no benefit to further negotiation."
