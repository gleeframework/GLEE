"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it leaves room for us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we settle around $850,000?  That feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit."",

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has met my best alternative price. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John."
