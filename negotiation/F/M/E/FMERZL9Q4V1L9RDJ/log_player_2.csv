{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $8,000.  He's offering $8,500, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and represents a good starting point for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget and only slightly lower than her previous offer.  It's better than buying from John, but Bob should continue to negotiate for a better price.  There are still rounds available and potential for a more favorable deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to her original price and further away from Bob's budget. At this point, the risk of further negotiation not resulting in a better deal is high. It's time to cut losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
