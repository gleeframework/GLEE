"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're looking to save money and the product is worth $800,000 to you, you should reject Alice's offer. This means you'll buy the product from John for $800,000, but you're not losing any money compared to Alice's offer.  The key here is that both options (buying from Alice or John) result in the same price for you, so you might as well reject the offer and buy from John."
