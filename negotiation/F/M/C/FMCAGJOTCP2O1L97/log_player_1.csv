Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for you, as I know it's worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:**  While John offers $100, selling to Bob quickly at a higher price is more desirable.

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product at a price below his perceived value, and Alice maximizes her profit."
