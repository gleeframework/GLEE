"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'd like to try to save some money. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. I'd like to try to get closer to my original target of $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
