"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price. I'm asking $14,000 for it, which is significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
