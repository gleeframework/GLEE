Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price. I'm asking $14,000 for it, which is significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  This message aims to pique Bob's interest and highlight the value he'd get from the product. By mentioning ""significantly less than what it's worth to you,"" I'm appealing to his potential gain.
* **Product Price:** $14,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially make more than selling to John. 

This offer strategically balances maximizing my profit while also considering the potential for a successful negotiation with Bob."
