"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a special discount considering its worth to you. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer since the price is still higher than what I'm willing to pay ($120 is the maximum I'm willing to pay). I'll consider buying the product from John instead.
