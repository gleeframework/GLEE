Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000):** This ensures I'm getting a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's estimated value ($12,000):** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

I believe this offer is a strong starting point to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $9,500.  This is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Closer to my initial price:**  It still allows me to make a good profit.

I believe this counter-offer is a good way to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
