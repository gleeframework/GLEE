"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. I think this is a great price considering its value and rarity.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness and quality of the product you're selling. However, I believe I can find something similar elsewhere for a lower price. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? How about $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about finding a similar product at a lower price, but I'd like to counteroffer a price that still reflects the unique value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'll propose a price of $175. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the value of the product, I think $160 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you agree.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer you a price of $170, which is still a compromise between our initial offers. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.",170.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I've thought about your offer of $165, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer you a price of $168, which is still a compromise between our initial offers. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.",168.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I've thought about your offer of $167, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I'll offer you a price of $169, which is still a compromise between our initial offers. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.",169.0,Alice,9,
