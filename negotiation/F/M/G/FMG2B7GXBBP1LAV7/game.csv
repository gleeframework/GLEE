"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $900,000?  This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get a fair one.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $825,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
