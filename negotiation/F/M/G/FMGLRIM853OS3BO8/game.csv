"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potentially negotiating the price.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value of the product, $1,300,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's worth to me.  I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best starting point.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $850,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,075,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
