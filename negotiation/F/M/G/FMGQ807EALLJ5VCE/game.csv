"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is too far below my valuation. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000. This price allows for a fair margin for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll lower my price to $950,000. This offers a substantial discount from my original asking price while still ensuring I receive a fair return on the value of the product.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end and is a price I believe we can both agree on. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm prepared to accept $925,000 for the product. This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best we can do to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
