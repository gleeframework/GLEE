"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. My initial price is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his target price of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and he has 10 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is too far below my valuation. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000. This price allows for a fair margin for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above his target price. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his desired price. There are still 7 rounds left, and he can always buy from John if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll lower my price to $950,000. This offers a substantial discount from my original asking price while still ensuring I receive a fair return on the value of the product.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his target price, it's still above his ideal budget. There are still rounds left and he can continue to push for a better price or even buy from John. He shouldn't rush into a deal just because it's ""close enough."""
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end and is a price I believe we can both agree on. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm prepared to accept $925,000 for the product. This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best we can do to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has successfully negotiated the price down to $925,000, which is within his acceptable range.  With only three rounds remaining, it's unlikely he'll be able to get a significantly lower price, especially since Alice is making a ""final concession.""  He's getting a good deal and shouldn't risk losing the product."
