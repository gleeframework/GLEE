Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a valued potential customer. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to sell it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $120 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can afford to start with a higher offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $150 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but even if he rejects the initial offer, there's a chance he'll come back with a price closer to his perceived value.
* **Confident Language:** The message uses confident language about the product's value without overselling it. This framing can make the offer more appealing. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while still maintaining a good chance of securing a sale with Bob."
