"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a valued potential customer. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to sell it for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $150, which is more than your maximum budget of $120. You can get the same product from John for $120, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
