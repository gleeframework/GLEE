"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I consider other offers.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
