"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product holds substantial value, and I believe $12,000 is a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us avoid going to John.",11000.0,Bob,4,
