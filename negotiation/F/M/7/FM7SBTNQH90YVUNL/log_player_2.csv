"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is significantly more than you are willing to pay. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering Alice the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, which is $120. This is the price I could get it from John, so it's a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $160 is still above my maximum price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price from Alice.  John is offering the product at my limit, so buying from him is the most financially sensible option."
