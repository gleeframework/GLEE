Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford right now.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.
