Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still leaving a significant profit margin for myself.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, and I'm willing to engage in a back-and-forth if necessary.  However, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
