"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. It's a fair starting point for something with such potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your desire to find a comfortable starting point.  However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. To be fair to both of us, I propose a compromise at $1,225,000.  This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to engage in a good-faith negotiation.
