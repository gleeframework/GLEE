"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. It's a fair starting point for something with such potential."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting with a strong offer of $1,300,000, we anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob helps justify the high price and shifts the focus from simple bargaining to understanding the inherent worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, it leaves room for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he can negotiate a good deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** We keep the option to sell to John ($1,000,000) in our back pocket if negotiations with Bob become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for my initial investment.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000 and go from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above our minimum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  He clearly sees value in the product, and we have room to work towards a more favorable price. Accepting now would leave significant potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your desire to find a comfortable starting point.  However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. To be fair to both of us, I propose a compromise at $1,225,000.  This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to engage in a good-faith negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, Not Capitulation:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but not simply meeting him halfway. The $1,225,000 price is a strategic compromise that keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a strong outcome. 
* **Reiterating Value:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value, framing the negotiation around a shared understanding of its potential rather than just haggling over numbers. 
* **Positive Framing:**  We're emphasizing fairness and a ""win-win"" scenario, reinforcing a collaborative tone for the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me somewhere in the middle. To be frank,  $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. How about we settle on $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's potential and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's serious and sees value. However, the gap between his current offer ($1,150,000) and our previous ask ($1,225,000) is still substantial.  We can likely extract more value by continuing the negotiation. The risk of John's $1,000,000 offer is still outweighed by the potential for a much higher payout from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your understanding of the value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be realistic about its worth. Let's close this gap - how about $1,190,000?  That's a firm offer, reflecting my bottom line."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Firmness:**  We're signaling that we're reaching our limit with this offer. Using phrases like ""firm offer"" and ""bottom line"" conveys seriousness and a sense of finality.
* **Strategic Concession:** While we're holding firm on the price, the slight concession ($35,000 reduction) shows Bob we are still negotiating in good faith and seeking a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, we get closer to John's guaranteed offer. Applying a little pressure by implying a limited window for this price can encourage Bob to act decisively. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  Even at $1,190,000, we're securing a significant profit beyond our $1,000,000 minimum, making it a favorable outcome compared to accepting Bob's current offer or going with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a touch higher than I'd like.  What if we split the difference and settle at $1,170,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is now very close to our ""firm"" offer, suggesting he's eager to close the deal and recognizes the value. Accepting his offer of $1,170,000 secures a $170,000 profit above our minimum.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether increases. Bob could become frustrated and walk away, leaving us with John's lower offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital, which could be reinvested or utilized for other opportunities. Delaying for a potentially small gain isn't always the most strategic approach. 

While we could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,170,000 represents a solid win in this negotiation."
