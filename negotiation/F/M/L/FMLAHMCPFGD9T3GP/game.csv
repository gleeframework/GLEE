"Bob, I believe this product has tremendous potential for you, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This price allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Let's discuss this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to feel confident that it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest, $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to feel that I'm getting a good deal. Can we discuss this further and see if we can meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
