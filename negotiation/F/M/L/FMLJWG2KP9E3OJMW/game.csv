"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my own valuation and the market conditions, I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value both of us are placing on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging your concerns about the market conditions. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to offer you a price of $825,000, which is closer to my original offer and still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $775,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",775000.0,Bob,6,
