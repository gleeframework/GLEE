"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the best chance to maximize my profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to try to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I can always lower my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.  I'll try to find a price that's more reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm still well above my minimum value, and I believe this price is a fair starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, even though it's slightly higher than his previous offer.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $900,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm now offering $875,000. This is a compromise, but it still keeps me above my minimum value.  With only a few rounds left, I need to strike a balance between getting a good price and ensuring a deal.  I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. 

It's clear that Bob and I are not going to agree on a price.  With only two rounds left, there is not enough time to reach a mutually agreeable offer.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
