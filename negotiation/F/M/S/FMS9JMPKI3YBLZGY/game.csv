"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll see its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Could you do $10,000?  That's the highest I could go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I need to price it accordingly.  How about we settle at $16,500? That's a compromise I'm willing to make.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but are still a bit far apart.  $16,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could possibly stretch to $12,000, but that's really my limit.",12000.0,Bob,6,
