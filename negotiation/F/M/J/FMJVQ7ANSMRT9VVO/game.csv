"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe we can find a price closer to its true value. How about we aim for $1,350,000? This would still allow me to save some money while being fair to you.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm proposing $1,400,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's reach a compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,387,500. This would ensure a profitable deal for both of us and allow us to finalize this transaction. ",1387500.0,Alice,5,
