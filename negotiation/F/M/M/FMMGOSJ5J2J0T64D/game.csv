"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a product within my budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? I would be very interested in your product if we could come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's a significant discount from my original price and a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand that $125 is a fair compromise. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $110? I believe this would be a win-win situation for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
