"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 8 rounds left and can still potentially get a better deal from Bob or fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to you while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a reasonable profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $1,025,000 is still below my desired minimum, it's getting closer to my goal. With only 6 rounds left, I'm not sure I can negotiate a significantly higher price, and there's always the risk of Bob walking away completely or me having to settle for John's offer.  It's a strategic decision to accept a price that is ""good enough"" at this point."
