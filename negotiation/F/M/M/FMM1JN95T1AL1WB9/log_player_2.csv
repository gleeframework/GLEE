"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $12,000. This is already above your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.  We'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and your need to sell."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $8500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still above our budget of $8,000. We need to continue negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would give you a healthy profit, and I'd be happy to purchase the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll give you a slight concession. I'll offer it to you for $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above our budget of $8,000. We've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down further.  It's better to cut our losses and buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within our budget."
