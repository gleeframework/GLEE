Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and your need to sell. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250? This would give you a healthy profit, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.
