"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and your need to sell.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $8500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250? This would give you a healthy profit, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll give you a slight concession. I'll offer it to you for $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",10000.0,Alice,5,
