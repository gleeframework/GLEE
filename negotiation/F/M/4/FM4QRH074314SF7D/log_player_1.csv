Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate or counteroffer, which keeps him engaged in the process.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer was a significant jump down, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. I'll counter with a price closer to $120 to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm aiming for a price that splits the difference between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's counteroffer ($110).  
* **Maintaining Value:** I don't want to drop the price too drastically, as this might make Bob undervalue the product.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  This counteroffer shows Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $120 is closer to what I had in mind. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $115 is a good price, exceeding my minimum by $15 and representing a successful negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a slightly higher price risks Bob walking away, leaving me to sell to John for $100.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now secures the sale and avoids potentially lengthy further negotiations."
