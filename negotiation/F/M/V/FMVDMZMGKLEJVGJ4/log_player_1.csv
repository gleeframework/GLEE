"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $15,000, knowing the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive tone:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** We have 8 rounds left, so there's ample time to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **John is a backup option:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That gives us both a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of rejecting Bob's offer outright, I'm offering a counter-proposal that's a middle ground between our positions. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I remind Bob that he's getting a good deal at $12,500, which is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I use a friendly tone and ask for Bob's opinion, encouraging him to continue the negotiation.

This strategy aims to find a mutually acceptable solution while maintaining a positive and collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $12500, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10000, so how about $11500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $12,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We now have 6 rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.
* **John is still a safe option:** If I can't get a better deal with Bob, selling to John for $12,000 is a safe and secure choice.

I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round, trying to push for a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $12,000? It's my minimum, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to my minimum:**  I'm sticking with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's a fair price for the product and gives me a good return.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to reinforce why $12,000 is a fair price. 
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using language that emphasizes closing the deal to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to secure my minimum desired price while maintaining a sense of urgency and finality in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to buying from John at $12000, but I'm willing to give you one more chance. How about $11800? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We only have 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. 
* **John is a sure thing:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome, and it's only slightly better than Bob's final offer.

While I could try to negotiate further with Bob, the risk of losing the deal altogether or ending up with a lower price outweighs the potential of gaining a small increment. I'm choosing to secure the $12,000 deal with John to ensure a positive outcome."
