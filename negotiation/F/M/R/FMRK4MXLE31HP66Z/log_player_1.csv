Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($100). This allows for negotiation, while still giving me a good profit margin.  I'm optimistic Bob will be interested, but I'm prepared to counter-offer or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering a price that is closer to my minimum value ($100) but still lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if he rejects it, I'm prepared to consider selling to John."
