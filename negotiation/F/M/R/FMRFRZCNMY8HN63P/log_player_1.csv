Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially earning a good profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value Bob would get from the product. This aims to make him more receptive to the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've secured a profitable sale.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine whether it's worth negotiating further. If his offer is too low, I'll likely counter with a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Stalls:**  If the negotiation drags on or Bob's offers are unacceptable, I'll  switch to John and sell the product for $15,000 to ensure a secure sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Risking John:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, it's worth exploring a counteroffer with Bob. There's a chance I can secure a price closer to my goal while avoiding the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and walking away.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, likely proposing a price between $10,000 and $12,000. 
* **Assessing Risk:**  If Bob's counteroffers consistently remain below my minimum, I'll switch to John to guarantee a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value our negotiation, I can't go below $11,000. This product is truly unique, and I believe it's worth that price for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($10,000) and my previous offer ($12,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the product's unique value to Bob, subtly reminding him of its worth.
* **Open to Discussion:** The ending question leaves the door open for further negotiation, hinting that I might be willing to budge slightly for a final agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've secured a profitable deal, close to my initial goal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer carefully.  If it's too low, I'll likely stick to my price or offer a slight concession, but I'll be prepared to switch to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $9,500. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting dangerously close to my minimum price of $15,000.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a significant risk that if I continue to negotiate with Bob, I'll end up accepting a price far below my desired value. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

**Conclusion:**  

While I'd prefer to maximize my profits, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high.  I'll secure the sale with John to guarantee my financial goals."
