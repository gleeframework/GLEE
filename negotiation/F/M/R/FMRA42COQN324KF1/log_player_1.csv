Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000, but this doesn't directly influence our initial offer. We want to start high.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer of $18,000, we set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind.  Even if he doesn't accept this price, it might make a slightly lower counter-offer seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $18,000 offer leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than his $12,000 valuation but lower than our $15,000 minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** We have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000. This means we shouldn't accept anything less than that from Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes we have some time to negotiate with Bob and don't need to sell the product immediately."
