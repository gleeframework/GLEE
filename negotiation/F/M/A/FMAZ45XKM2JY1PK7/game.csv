"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While the product sounds interesting,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a deal for $13,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13200.0,Alice,5,
