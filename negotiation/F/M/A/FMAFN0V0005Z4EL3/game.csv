"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I believe it would be a perfect fit for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is simply out of my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the inherent worth of this product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,200,000 is closer to where I'd need to be, it's still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some movement from your side as well.  How about $1,050,000? This is a very fair offer considering the true value of what you're getting.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,6,
