"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would allow both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference:  I'm willing to come down to $10,150.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would avoid us having to go back and forth further.  Let me know if you're interested.",10150.0,Alice,5,
