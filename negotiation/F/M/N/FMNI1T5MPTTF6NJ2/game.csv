"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this negotiation is dragging on a bit. I'm willing to pay $10,250, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and my previous offer of $11,500, which is $10,875. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10875.0,Alice,7,
