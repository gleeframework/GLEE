# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.
