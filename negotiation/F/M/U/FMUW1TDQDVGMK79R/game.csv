"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,750. Can you consider that?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your persistence in finding a price we can both agree on.  $13,750 is still a little lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,900.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",13900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",13800.0,Bob,6,
