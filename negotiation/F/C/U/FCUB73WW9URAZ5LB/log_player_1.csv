Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000.
* This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* This strategy gives Bob a potential bargain, increasing the likelihood of him accepting the offer. 
* If he rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
