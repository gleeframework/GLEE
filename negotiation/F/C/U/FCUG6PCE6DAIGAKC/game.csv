"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,300,000.  This still allows me to profit, and it's a much fairer price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to John instead.  Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
