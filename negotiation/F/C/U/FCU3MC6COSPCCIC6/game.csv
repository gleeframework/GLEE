"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is still below my max budget.  Let's try to make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $95, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $105. It's a bit above my minimum price, but I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
