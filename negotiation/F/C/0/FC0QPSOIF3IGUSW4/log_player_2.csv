"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to your business. Let's start our discussion with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, you want to try and get it down further.
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you some room to negotiate. 
* **A counteroffer allows you to test Alice's willingness to budge.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While she's moved closer to your desired price, $950,000 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.** You have 7 rounds remaining and you've established a willingness to negotiate.  It's likely Alice will continue to come down.
* **A counteroffer allows you to continue pushing for a better price.** By making another counteroffer, you might be able to get Alice even closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm ready to compromise. $925,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for us both. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target price.**  At $940,000, you're only $25,000 away from your ideal price.
* **You have more rounds, but there's risk of stalling.** There are 5 rounds remaining, and you might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, but the risk is that Alice might not budge further.
* **Buying from John is a backup, but not the best option.** While John's offer is always available, you'd be paying significantly more. 

**Overall:**  It's a good time to accept the offer.  While a bit higher than your ideal, it's a fair deal that saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
