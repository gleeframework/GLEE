Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm looking to get $175 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $175, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Reasonable price:**  While $175 is above Bob's perceived value, it's not an outrageous price. 

This strategy aims to get the best price while keeping the negotiation open for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $100? It's a great deal for you and still a good price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also lower than what I know John is willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is clearly not willing to meet my initial price, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price than $100.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $150, which is closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not walking away.  This shows I'm still interested in selling to him. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a middle ground price of $130.  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive tone and express my appreciation for Bob's interest.  This can help to maintain a good relationship during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While Bob has increased his offer, $115 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation potential:** Although we're getting closer, I believe there's still room for improvement. Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, so I'm not ready to give up yet. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, selling to John for $150 is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer.  $115 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Would you be willing to go up to $125? That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's compromise and moving closer to his offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Finding common ground:** I'm emphasizing the ""good compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging, avoiding any aggressive language.

This counteroffer aims to:

* Keep the negotiations moving forward.
* Achieve a price closer to my desired outcome.
* Maintain a positive relationship with Bob in case we need to continue negotiating."
