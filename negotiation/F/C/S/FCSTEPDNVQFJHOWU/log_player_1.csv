{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me some room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  $9,500 is close enough to Bob's value that he might be tempted to make a counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  This price still ensures I make a profit while remaining competitive. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the power to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy.  
* **Negotiate Strategically:** I'll try to find a price that maximizes my profit while still keeping Bob engaged. 
* **Don't Be Afraid to Walk Away:**  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll sell to John and secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired amount.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $8,500, aiming to find a compromise.
* **Monitor Bob's Reactions:** I will carefully observe Bob's response to my counteroffer to gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate further.
* **Be Prepared to Sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I will not hesitate to sell the product to John and secure my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's counteroffer ($8,500). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000, so I'm not giving up too much.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer will help gauge whether Bob is truly interested in the product at a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction to my counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept his previous offer. 
* **Ready to Sell to John:**  If Bob continues to push for a price significantly below $9,000, I'll be prepared to sell the product to John and secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $8,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss. 
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:** I've already made several concessions, and further negotiation seems unlikely to bring Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Securing my Minimum Value:** John is a reliable buyer who will pay my minimum acceptable value. This is the most sensible option to ensure I don't lose money on this deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:**  I will contact John and finalize the sale at $10,000. This will guarantee my desired profit.
* **End Negotiations with Bob:**  I will inform Bob that I've decided to sell the product to another buyer."
