Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. While $1,500,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to negotiate to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial price, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my desired value. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but it still allows for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and I'm worried that continuing to negotiate with him will only drag this out further.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, I'm confident that selling to John will secure a very good price and allow me to move on to other opportunities."
