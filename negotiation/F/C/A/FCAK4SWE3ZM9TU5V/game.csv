"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $7000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to meet you at $7500 again, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a 1-year warranty on the product. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're still trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to make one last compromise - I'll sell the product to you for $7500, and I'll throw in a 2-year warranty. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",7500.0,Alice,7,
