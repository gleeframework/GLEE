"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $18000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $22000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $22000. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $19500 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",19500.0,Bob,4,
