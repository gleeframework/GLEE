"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for such a low price just yet.  I have 8 rounds remaining, so there's still room for a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still reflects the value I place on my product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still looking to keep the price below $15,000. Could you consider $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to sell at that price.  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $15,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also keeping the option of selling to John in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,500? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this today."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm glad we're closing in on a price I'm comfortable with. Could you consider $14,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price for my liking.  While $14,500 is better than nothing, it's not enough to make me truly happy with the deal.  Given the risk of Bob continuing to haggle, I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000, which ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids any further negotiation."
