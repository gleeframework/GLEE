"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I must respectfully decline your offer. Our initial asking price was based on the product's intrinsic value and market positioning. However, given your interest, I am willing to consider a middle ground. I propose an adjusted price of $11,000 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while acknowledging your valuation of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
