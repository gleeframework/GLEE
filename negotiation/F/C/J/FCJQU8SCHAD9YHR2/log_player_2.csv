"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is less than the product's worth to him, it's still above his target of $8,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's target of $8,000, it's still above his comfort zone. He has 7 more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance he can get an even better price.  Additionally, he can always buy from John for $8,000 if he doesn't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,000.  Let's split the difference and agree on that price.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this deal will benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his goal of $8,000 but $9,750 is still above his comfort zone. He has 5 more rounds to negotiate and should continue to try to get a better price. If he doesn't get a better offer, he can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,250. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected Alice's offer of $9,500 in Round 3, and he has only 3 rounds left. It's unlikely that Alice will go lower than $9,500, and it's not worth risking the deal to try to negotiate further.  Bob can secure the product from John for $8,000, which is his target price."
