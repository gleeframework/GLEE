"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1,700,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,800,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this work.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $1,780,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm open to discussing other options, but I'm not going to go any higher.",1780000.0,Alice,5,
