"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,200 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,600? I think that's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",9600.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. Let's do this: $9,300 and we have a deal.",9300.0,Bob,6,
