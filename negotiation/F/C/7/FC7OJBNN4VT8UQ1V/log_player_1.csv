"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving room for Bob:**  A $11,000 offer is still above Bob's valuation of $8,000, making it reasonable for him to consider. 
* **Testing the waters:** This first round is about gauging Bob's interest and seeing if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** There's still room for negotiation.  I can counteroffer at a price that's closer to my target but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Avoiding a subpar deal:** Selling to Bob at $9,500 would be a significant loss compared to my potential earnings with John. 

**Next step:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to $11,000 to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also  maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Maintaining value:** $10,500 is still above Bob's valuation and a significant amount of money for him, making it a worthwhile negotiation for him.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway and see if he's genuinely interested in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,200 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, there's not much room left for negotiation.  
* **John is a better option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, making him the more attractive option at this point. 

**Next step:** I will likely make one more counteroffer to Bob, but I'm leaning heavily towards selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is my final attempt to get a deal with Bob. $10,000 is a significant compromise from my initial price, but it's still above Bob's valuation and within my acceptable range. 
* **Creating urgency:** I need to show Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal. My decision to counteroffer again demonstrates my willingness to work with him but also sets a deadline for a decision.
* **John as backup:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, I have a guaranteed deal with John that I can go to immediately. This gives me leverage.

**Next step:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately go to John and sell the product to him for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further negotiation:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low, and I've already made significant concessions. There's not much more room for negotiation.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John offers a price that meets my minimum acceptable price and provides a guaranteed profit.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only four rounds left, I can't risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially lose out on a more profitable deal with John.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to end the negotiation with Bob and finalize the deal with John. This guarantees me the best possible outcome for my product."
