Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations to see if there's room for compromise. If he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is acceptable to him, but I'm prepared to go lower if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is too low for me.  While I could keep negotiating, it's becoming clear that we're far apart in our valuations.  John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is more than what I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John."
