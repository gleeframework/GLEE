"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. I'm confident this price is fair considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
