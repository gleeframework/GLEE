I'm starting high, hoping to get close to my minimum value of $100.  I'll see what Bob's reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and while I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering the price to $100, which is my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price and agree to buy it. If he doesn't, I can still sell to John for the same price, so I'm not losing anything."
