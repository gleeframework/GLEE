"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that truly stands out in its category. Given its value and features, I believe it's worth more than what others are asking for. Considering its worth to you, I propose to sell it to you for $100. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at an attractive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $80 and the guaranteed price of $80 from John. You can leverage John's offer to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy from John."
