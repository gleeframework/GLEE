I'm increasing my offer slightly to $140, hoping to meet Alice halfway.  This is still a good price for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering we're both getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $149.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my maximum price. I've had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up. To ensure I get the product at my target price, I'll choose to buy from John for $120."
