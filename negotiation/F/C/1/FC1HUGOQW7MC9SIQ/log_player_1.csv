{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a round number, which can be easier for Bob to process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach an agreement."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 135}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can go a bit lower. How about $132?
