"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $80, but I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You can get the product for $90 from Alice, which is $10 less than what John is selling it for. 
* **While you value the product at $100, Alice's offer is still a good deal.** You're saving $10 compared to your maximum price."
