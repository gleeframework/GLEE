Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $14,000, Alice aims for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation while still leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy increases the chance of Bob accepting a price higher than $12,000 but lower than John's offer, maximizing Alice's potential profit."
