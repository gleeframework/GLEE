,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you're seeking.  Let's discuss this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product.

I'm willing to consider a price of $1,400,000, as a final offer to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of what I'm offering.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
