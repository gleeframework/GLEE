"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget,  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,600,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's still a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
