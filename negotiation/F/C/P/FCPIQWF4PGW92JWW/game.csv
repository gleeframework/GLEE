"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $175. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to consider that price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $160? That's still a great price for the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $145? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $145 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $155, which would be $150. Would you be willing to accept that price?",150.0,Bob,6,
