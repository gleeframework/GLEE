"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is less than my maximum budget, it's significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $10,000. There's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation. This gives us room to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price.  My goal is to secure the product for as close to Alice's valuation as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still too high. I'll reject and propose a counteroffer a bit closer to her last offer to show I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm offering Alice her valuation of the product. This is a strong offer, and while she might try to negotiate further, it puts the pressure on her to either accept a fair deal or potentially lose the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I think I can do better than that. How about $11,000? It's still a good price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can shake on it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her previous offers, even though she backtracked in her message. It seems unlikely she'll go much lower than $10,500. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm serious about the $10,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about this purchase, but I need to be mindful of my budget. $10,000 is my final offer. If you can't meet that, I understand, but I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This message combines a firm stance on price with a gentle ultimatum. By stating it's my final offer and hinting at alternatives (John), I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept. This is a calculated risk, but with time running out, it's a risk worth taking to secure the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your seriousness about the purchase, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,000, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has met me halfway and declared this her final offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise, saving me $4,500 compared to John's offer. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice walking away, leaving me to buy from John at a higher price."
