"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this works for you!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I think I can do better than that. How about $11,000? It's still a good price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can shake on it!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm serious about this purchase, but I need to be mindful of my budget. $10,000 is my final offer. If you can't meet that, I understand, but I may have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your seriousness about the purchase, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,000, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,7,
