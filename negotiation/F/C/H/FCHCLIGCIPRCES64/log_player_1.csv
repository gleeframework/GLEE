Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with an offer of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. I'm looking for a price closer to my budget. Can we meet somewhere between $8,000 and $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd love to sell the product, $8,500 is significantly below my minimum value.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,000. This allows us to stay within a reasonable range for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum value. This is a good compromise, and it's better than risking a further decline in offers or selling to John for $12,000."
