"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 is a fair starting point considering its value, I'm willing to come down to $170. That's already a significant discount.",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $170 is still more than I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
