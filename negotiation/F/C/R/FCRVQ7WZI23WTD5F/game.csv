"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the true worth of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,400,000. How about we settle at $1,450,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
