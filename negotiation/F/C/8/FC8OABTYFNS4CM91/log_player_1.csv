Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Minimum Price:** Your minimum acceptable price is $100.
* **John as Backup:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob declines.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($130) creates a strong incentive for him to buy. This price also provides you with a significant profit margin above your minimum."
