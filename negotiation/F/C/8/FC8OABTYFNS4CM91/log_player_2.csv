"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $130 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150. This is a good deal for you."
