"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's significantly more than my $8,000 limit and even more than her product's value to her. I need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a much lower offer ($6,000) to see how Alice responds. This approach allows for significant room for negotiation.  While it's a lowball offer, it indicates my strong interest in getting a significantly discounted price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $9,000 is still above my $8,000 limit. I'll counter-offer again to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to $7,000, which shows willingness to compromise but keeps me below my $8,000 limit. I'm aiming for a price point where Alice still makes a profit but I get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a bit more than your last offer, but still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging much from her $9,000-$9,500 range. It's clear she's unlikely to accept an offer that works for me.  Buying from John for $8,000 is the best option now, ensuring I stay within my budget."
