Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a special price of $14,000. I believe it would provide significant value to you, and this offer reflects my desire for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will pay $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob first allows us to potentially secure a higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he's highly interested.
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message aims to build rapport and present the offer as advantageous for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If we had more information about Bob (e.g., is he a tough negotiator?), we could adjust our strategy.
* **Time Constraints:** If there's a time limit to sell the product, we might reduce the price to ensure a sale to Bob."
