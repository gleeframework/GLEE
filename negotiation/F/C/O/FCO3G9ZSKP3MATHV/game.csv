"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1500000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This price is still very fair considering the potential benefits you'll realize.  Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  To find a price that works for both of us, I'm willing to lower my price to $1700000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair balance between our positions.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1650000. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",1650000.0,Bob,6,
