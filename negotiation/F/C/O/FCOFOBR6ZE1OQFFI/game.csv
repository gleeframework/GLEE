"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a steal for what it's worth!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $100, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we both feel good about.  To be frank, $100 is cutting it close to my bottom line.  Could you meet me at $125 and we'll call it a deal?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting a great deal on this - it's really worth more. But, I'm ready to close this out. How about $117.50 and we have a deal?",117.5,Alice,7,
