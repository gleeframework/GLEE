"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle on $850,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,
