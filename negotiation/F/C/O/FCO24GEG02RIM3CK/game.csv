"Thanks for offering, Alice!  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $110 is a pretty big jump. How about $118?  I'm trying to stick to a budget.",118.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $118 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $122.  It's a fair price that's within both of our budgets.",122.0,Alice,5,
