"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob and $8,000 to Alice, so there is room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and I pay $8500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9250. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $8750. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has made her final offer at $9,100. This is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's below Bob's maximum willingness to pay.  It's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing the product altogether or having to pay John's higher price."
