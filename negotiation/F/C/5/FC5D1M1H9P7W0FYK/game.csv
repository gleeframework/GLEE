"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the rarity of this product, $2000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to offer you $1500000.  This is still a very fair price for such a unique item and allows us both to walk away with a successful negotiation.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1750000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $1750000. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $1600000, which is still a fair price for this unique product and allows us both to walk away with a successful negotiation.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1700000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
