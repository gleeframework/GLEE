"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by trying to create a sense of urgency and implying a potential loss if you don't accept.  While her offer of $1,150,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be bluffing about the other buyer to pressure you. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and open the possibility for a counter-offer."
