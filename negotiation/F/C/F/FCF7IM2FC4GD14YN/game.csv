"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit out of your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. How about we settle at $110? That would be a fair price for both of us, I think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I understand that $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
