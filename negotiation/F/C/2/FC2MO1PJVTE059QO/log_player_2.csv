"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. My initial offer is $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly more than Alice's own valuation of $800,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **John's price is a fallback option.**  While John's price is higher, it's a safety net if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  This counteroffer significantly lowers the price while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit (given her valuation of $800,000). 
* **Clear justification:**  The message explains why you're making this counteroffer, making it more likely Alice will consider it seriously.
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation:**  By offering a lower price, you're setting the stage for further negotiation, potentially leading to a deal that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $900000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but it's a bit closer to your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's compromise isn't enough.** While it's a step in the right direction, $900,000 is still too high for you. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:** You have already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. This suggests there's still room for a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's price is still a fallback.**  If negotiations with Alice stall, you can always opt to buy from John, ensuring you get the product."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows for some profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful increase:**  The offer is only $25,000 higher than your previous offer, showing you're willing to budge but still maintain a firm stance. 
* **Clear justification:**  The message emphasizes fairness and a focus on both parties' interests, aiming to build rapport and increase the likelihood of Alice accepting.
* **Positioning for a final agreement:**  This offer might be close enough to Alice's desired price to lead to a deal, especially if she's motivated to close the transaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a constructive conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go to $887500. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $887,500 is very close to your counteroffer of $875,000. It's likely you won't get a much better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While accepting the offer, you could still attempt to negotiate a slightly lower price in the final agreement process, potentially getting closer to your target of $875,000.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice backing out of the deal altogether, leaving you with John's higher price as your only option.  Accepting the offer secures the purchase at a relatively good price."
