Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. The product sounds promising, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1200000. This would allow us both to make a fair deal, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
