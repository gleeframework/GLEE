Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **High profit:**  $1,400,000 is significantly more than what I would get from John. 
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $1,400,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Minimizes risk:** While I'm not maximizing Bob's potential profit, offering a lower price increases the likelihood he'll accept, reducing the risk of him rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John."
