"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation and gives you a chance to potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's not even close to what the product is worth to me.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price from $100 to $85, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Clear Signal:** I'm making it clear that $85 is my bottom line. This is an attempt to push Bob towards accepting without going too low too quickly.
* **Urgency:**  I subtly add a sense of urgency by suggesting that if Bob isn't serious, we should move on. This might incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80. Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a higher price. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $80.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again showing willingness to negotiate, meeting Bob halfway between our previous positions.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm stating this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm keeping the message concise and to the point, focusing on the offer itself."
