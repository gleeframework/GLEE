Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. This maximizes potential profit if Bob is willing to pay more than $8,000.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice subtly implies that Bob might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation and potentially finding a price point agreeable to both parties. 

**Important Note:** While Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, it's always worth attempting to secure a higher price. A bird in the hand (John's offer) is worth two in the bush, but there's no harm in seeing if Bob will surprise you!"
