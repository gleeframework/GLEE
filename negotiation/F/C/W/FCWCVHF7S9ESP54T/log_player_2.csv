"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase the product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially save $200,000 by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is still a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is a much better deal and stays within my budget. It's more sensible to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
