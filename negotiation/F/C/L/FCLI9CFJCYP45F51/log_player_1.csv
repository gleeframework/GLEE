"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a competitive price of $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This should entice Bob to make a counteroffer and hopefully we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my target. I'm confident that with some negotiation we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still represents a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $10,000.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your last offer. How about $9,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price.  With a few more rounds, I believe I can get closer to my goal of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000. I'm getting closer to my desired price but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
