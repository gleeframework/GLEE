Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it sets a strong baseline and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm also aware that John is a safety net at $800,000, giving me confidence to push for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than his offer and closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my initial asking price, and it's above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. Accepting this offer would be the best choice to maximize my profits."
