"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the value it will bring you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
