"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your walk-away price and Alice's own valuation. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer starts significantly lower than Alice's offer but still provides a good profit margin for her (almost double her valuation).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves space for further negotiation. Alice is likely to counter, and we can move towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, our worst-case scenario is buying from John for $1,200,000.  This counter-offer keeps us far below that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price still leaves you with a significant profit, and allows me to get closer to my desired value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room to Negotiate:** Alice moved closer to the middle ground, which is a good sign. However, the new price is still considerably higher than both her valuation and a price you'd find acceptable.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about getting a better price and willing to walk away if necessary. This can encourage Alice to make further concessions.
* **John as a Backstop:**  You always have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, keeping you safe from an unreasonable deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle on $775,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would still be a profitable deal for you."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  We are increasing our offer, demonstrating willingness to move towards a deal. However, the increase is modest, keeping the pressure on Alice.
* **Focusing on Profit:**  By highlighting the profit Alice would still make, we are framing the offer in a positive light for her.
* **Maintaining Distance:**  The proposed price is still significantly below Alice's asking price and keeps us well below our walk-away point."
