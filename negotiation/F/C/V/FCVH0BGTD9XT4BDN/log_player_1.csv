Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique nature and my own valuation, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we can afford to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,300,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique nature"" and your own ""valuation"" helps justify the high price without revealing your guaranteed buyer.

This approach aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price that's significantly higher than his perceived value. If he rejects the offer, we still have John as a secure fallback option."
