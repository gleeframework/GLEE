Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Offering the product at $135 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives him a potential ""deal"" while still netting you a profit above your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is phrased in a way that leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer."
