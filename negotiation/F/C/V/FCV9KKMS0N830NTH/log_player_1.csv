Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is considerably below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to see this product benefit your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still far too high for me. While I'm eager to acquire this product, I can't go beyond my initial offer of $800,000. Perhaps we can meet halfway at $1,400,000? This would allow both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
