"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and answering any questions you might have.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is considerably below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to see this product benefit your business.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still far too high for me. While I'm eager to acquire this product, I can't go beyond my initial offer of $800,000. Perhaps we can meet halfway at $1,400,000? This would allow both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1400000.0,Bob,4,
