"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap is still too wide for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget limitations.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
