# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. This is my best and final offer for now.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This seems like a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've managed to negotiate the price down by $125,000, which is a considerable amount. 
* **""Best and Final"":** Alice has indicated that this is her best offer for now. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Time Constraint:** You're already on Round 5 of 10.  Continuing to negotiate risks the chance of not reaching an agreement and having to settle for John's price. 

While you might be able to push Alice a little further, the potential gain doesn't seem to outweigh the risk of losing the deal altogether."
