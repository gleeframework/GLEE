Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so aiming slightly lower at $110 gives you a good chance of securing the sale while maximizing your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer scenario, starting high leaves you room to potentially drop the price slightly if Bob counters, and still stay above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid Underselling:** Offering it for less than $110 significantly decreases your potential earnings, especially since you have John as a backup buyer at $80."
