Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that's sure to be a valuable asset. I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $800000 for it. I believe we can find a fair price that works for both of us. Let's aim for $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to that number with further negotiation.  Selling to John is an option, but I want to explore getting a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can deliver substantial returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think we can find a balance that respects both our positions. Considering the product's value and my budget, I propose a price of $900000. This figure aims to be fair for both parties and within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still believe there's room for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell for less than my minimum threshold yet.  I'll see if I can push for a higher price with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. This product is truly exceptional and has the potential to generate significant benefits for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This figure is fair to both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I respect your position, Alice, and I understand the value of the product. Given my budget constraints, I propose a price of $950000. This figure aims to be a compromise that respects both our interests and keeps the transaction feasible for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and see if I can push for a higher price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still not able to accept a price below $1,000,000.  This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and its value is reflected in that price. Let's aim for a final agreement at $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this matter careful consideration, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between respecting the product's value and staying within my budget. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While $975,000 is tempting, I'm concerned that further negotiation will only yield a marginal increase. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
