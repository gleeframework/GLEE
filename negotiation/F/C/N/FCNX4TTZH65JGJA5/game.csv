"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that's sure to be a valuable asset. I'm starting with a price of $2000000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $800000 for it. I believe we can find a fair price that works for both of us. Let's aim for $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $600000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can deliver substantial returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1200000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think we can find a balance that respects both our positions. Considering the product's value and my budget, I propose a price of $900000. This figure aims to be fair for both parties and within my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. This product is truly exceptional and has the potential to generate significant benefits for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This figure is fair to both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I respect your position, Alice, and I understand the value of the product. Given my budget constraints, I propose a price of $950000. This figure aims to be a compromise that respects both our interests and keeps the transaction feasible for me.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $950000 is getting closer, I'm still not able to accept a price below $1000000.  This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and its value is reflected in that price. Let's aim for a final agreement at $1000000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given this matter careful consideration, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between respecting the product's value and staying within my budget. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",975000.0,Bob,8,
