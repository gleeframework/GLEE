"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle on $95? This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $95, so how about we settle on $105? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for this product. This is a fair price, and it's the most I can afford. Let's close this deal.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet at $100? I think that's the lowest price I can accept for this product.",100.0,Alice,7,
