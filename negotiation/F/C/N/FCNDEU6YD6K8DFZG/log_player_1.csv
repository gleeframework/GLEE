Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's estimated value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation. However, it's also above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I still profit from the sale.  

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his estimated value. It also gets me closer to my ideal price."
