"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can do better than $1,450,000.  Since Alice values the product at $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and is within your budget. This offer shows you are serious about buying the product but are also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still a good deal for you. It's below your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John. While further negotiation could potentially lower the price, the risk of Alice walking away or you losing the product to John outweighs the potential gains from continued haggling."
