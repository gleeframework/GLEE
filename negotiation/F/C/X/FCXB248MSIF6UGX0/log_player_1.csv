I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While he is offering a bit more, it's still too low for me.  I'm going to see if I can get him to budge on the price without the extra feature."

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're getting very close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and while I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a much lower price. $880,000 is a good compromise and allows me to secure a decent profit."
