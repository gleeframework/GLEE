Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $90. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $90, and it's not worth risking a worse deal. Buying from John at $80 is the most financially sound choice now."
