"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but my initial offer already represents a significant discount on the product's true value.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",950000.0,Alice,5,
