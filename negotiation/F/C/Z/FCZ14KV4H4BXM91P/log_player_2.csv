"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so she must be making a profit. I'm sure she can afford to lower the price a bit. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better deal from her or from John.
