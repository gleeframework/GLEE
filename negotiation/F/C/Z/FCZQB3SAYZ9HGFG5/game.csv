"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'd love to offer you. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to start at $150. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 would be my minimum.  Let me know if that's a possibility for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110.  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $110.  I'm still a bit away from where I need to be, but if you were willing to go to $115, I could accept that and we could close the deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to hear you're getting closer to my price point. I'm still not quite there at $115, but I can go up to $112.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",112.0,Bob,6,
