"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not quite there, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to moving forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
