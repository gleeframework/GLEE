"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate and bring the price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for my budget though. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's initial ask ($22,000) and my actual limit ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a fair deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I understand this offer might be too low for Alice to accept immediately.  However, it opens up the negotiation and allows us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway? I could consider $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $15,000 is still too high. I'll make another counteroffer to try and meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I've increased my offer to $11,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  This offer is above my ideal price but still below Alice's last offer. It gives us both room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price we're both comfortable with.
* **Time Consideration:** We still have a few rounds left, but it's good to start moving towards a decision. This offer might encourage Alice to counter with a more reasonable price."
