"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. Considering its value to you and the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident it's worth it to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
