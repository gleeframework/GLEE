"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
