"Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $90, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering me for this product. I'm interested but $90 is a bit out of my budget. How about $75? That would be a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $75 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? I'm confident you'll find this price reasonable.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my absolute maximum. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",80.0,Bob,4,
