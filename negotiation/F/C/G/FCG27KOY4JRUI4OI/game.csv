"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $500000 for the product. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $500000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product's value is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price still allows me to recover a reasonable portion of the product's worth.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in the middle? I would like to propose a price of $700000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",700000.0,Bob,4,
