"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the price. For now, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,320,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and Alice's offer is still higher than his maximum budget.  There is still room for negotiation, so he should reject the offer and continue to try and lower the price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll sell the product to you for $1,292,500.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,292,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Bob should reject the offer and continue to negotiate. He has a good chance of getting the price down further by offering a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair price, considering your original asking price.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,275,000. I'll meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, her offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's budget.  At this point, Bob has a better option: buying the product from John for $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks exceeding his budget or running out of rounds.  Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
