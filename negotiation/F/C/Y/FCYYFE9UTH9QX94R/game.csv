"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,225,000 is closer to my budget, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $1,160,000?",1160000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we are getting closer. I value your interest in the product and I'm aiming to strike a fair deal. How about we settle at $1,190,000? This feels like a good compromise that recognizes the product's value.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
