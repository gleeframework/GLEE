Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and a real steal at that price! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $120 is lower than what Bob values the product at ($150), leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This price is not overly aggressive and gives Bob room to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You're going to counteroffer Bob and try to get a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
