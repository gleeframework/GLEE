"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $15000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8000 is just too low for me.  This product has a lot of value, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you than that. How about we split the difference and go with $11500? This would give you a great deal and still allow me to reach my target price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $9500? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this now.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9500, which would be $9250. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,6,
