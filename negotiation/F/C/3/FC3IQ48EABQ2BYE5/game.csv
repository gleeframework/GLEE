"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be very interested.  I'm asking for $15000 for it.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $11500?  This would give us both a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to go down to $10500.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the best I can do. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10500, so how about $10250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
