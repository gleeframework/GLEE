"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering your asking price is just slightly above your own valuation. Let's see if we can make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
