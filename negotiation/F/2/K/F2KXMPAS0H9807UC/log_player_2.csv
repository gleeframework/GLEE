{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Still trying to save as much money as possible, while also being within his budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. If we can reach an agreement at that price, I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible, while still being within his budget.
* **Counteroffer:** $11,000 is a small increase from Bob's previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate but also his firm stance on his price limit.
* **Strategic Move:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but won't overpay. It also leaves room for Alice to make a slight concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I think I can do a bit better. I'll sell the product to you for $11250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,250 is a very reasonable price for Bob, considering his initial budget and the negotiation progress. It's a good compromise, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price. However, there's also a risk that Alice might become less flexible and Bob could end up with a worse deal or no deal at all.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Buying from John for $15,000 would cost Bob significantly more than accepting Alice's offer.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob at this stage. It allows him to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and represents a substantial saving compared to buying from John."
