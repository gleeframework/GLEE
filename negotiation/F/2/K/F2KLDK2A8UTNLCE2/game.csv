"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low, I could be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but $130 is still a bit much for me.  How about $95? That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $95 is just too low for what I'm offering.  My final offer is $115.  Take it or leave it.",115.0,Alice,5,
