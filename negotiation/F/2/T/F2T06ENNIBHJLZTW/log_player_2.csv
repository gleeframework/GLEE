"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate, especially since Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget. There's potential to save a lot of money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to bargain. I'm aiming to get a better price than $600,000 while keeping in mind my budget of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my desired price, but I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price below $600,000. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not ready to accept it. There's a chance I can get a better price, and I want to avoid making a decision that I might regret later. I'm also not in a rush, as I can always choose to buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $600,000, which is the same as Alice's first offer. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still trying to get a lower price than Alice's most recent offer of $700,000. It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to accept her next offer, as long as it doesn't exceed $700,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is still below my budget, and there are only three rounds left. At this point, the potential for further negotiation is limited, and I risk running out of time and having to buy from John for a higher price. While I would ideally prefer a lower price, accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of a last-minute price hike from Alice or being forced to buy from John."
