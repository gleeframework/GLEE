"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking $15,000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product is truly top-of-the-line, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll receive. Let's try to reach a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
