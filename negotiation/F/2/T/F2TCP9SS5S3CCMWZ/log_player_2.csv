"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking $15,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There's a lot of room for negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious interest in purchasing but highlighting the value difference.  It's also below Bob's maximum budget, leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product is truly top-of-the-line, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to push for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll receive. Let's try to reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is increasing his offer to $10,000, showing a willingness to compromise. This is still below his budget, leaving some wiggle room.
* **Highlighting Value:** Bob mentions the value he'll receive to emphasize the deal's worth for him.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  Bob explicitly asks for a compromise, showing a desire to reach an agreement."
