"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you.  I'm offering it for $150.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's too expensive for Bob's budget, so rejecting is the logical choice. We'll counteroffer and see if we can negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a little too low for me, considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another chance to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
