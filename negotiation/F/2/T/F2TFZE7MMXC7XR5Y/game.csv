"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $132.50. How about we try $128?",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $128 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $130? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $129?",129.0,Bob,6,
