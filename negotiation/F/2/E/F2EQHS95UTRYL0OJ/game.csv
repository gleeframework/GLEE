"Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value to me and your desired price. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. Given the value of the product to both parties, I am unable to agree to a price below $12,000. I would be happy to continue discussing this further if you're open to revisiting the price at or above $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
