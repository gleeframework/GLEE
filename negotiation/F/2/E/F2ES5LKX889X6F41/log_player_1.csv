{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a decent profit.
* **Positive Message:** My message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and motivate Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the ""amazing"" nature of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's initial counteroffer is too far off the mark.  There's still room to bargain and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I will use this opportunity to highlight the value of the product and attempt to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving from $11,500 to $10,500. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Value Emphasis:** I remind Bob that $10,500 is still a ""great deal"" for him, highlighting the product's worth.
* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer significantly narrows the gap between our positions and is closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll need to reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer than before, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to feel that further bargaining might not be productive.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John.  This gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob or simply sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap a little more.  If he rejects this offer, I'll finalize the sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a little further, but $9,750 is just too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $10,125?  That's a fair price for both of us. If you're serious about this, let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final counteroffer before I move on to selling to John. I'm trying to bridge the gap one last time.
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm only lowering the price by $375 from my previous offer, signaling that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a final offer, encouraging Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately finalize the sale with John.  I'm confident that John's offer is a better deal than accepting anything below my minimum acceptable price."
