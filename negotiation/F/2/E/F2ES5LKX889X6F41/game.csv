"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? ",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a little further, but $9,750 is just too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $10,125?  That's a fair price for both of us. If you're serious about this, let's close the deal.",10125.0,Alice,5,
