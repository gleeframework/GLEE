"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see how he reacts. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always go to John if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm not thrilled about the prospect of further negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1 million. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired value. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and will hopefully lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm unwilling to settle for anything less than $1 million, especially since I have the option to sell to John for that amount. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer.  I'm getting closer to his desired price point, which should encourage him to come back with a more favorable counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a better price with more negotiation. I'm running out of time, but I'm willing to risk it for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm now offering the product for $1,000,000, my minimum price.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer. It's a clear indication that I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm also not willing to go lower."
