# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. Given its value to you, this seems like a fair deal that maximizes both our satisfaction and the transaction's efficiency. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John. There's a chance Alice might come down in price if you reject her initial offer."
