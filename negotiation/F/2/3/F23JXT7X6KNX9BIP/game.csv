"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
