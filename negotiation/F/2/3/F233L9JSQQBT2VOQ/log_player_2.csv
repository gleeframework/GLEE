"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth paying $200 for the product when you can get it from John for $150. Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

Let's start with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $125 is a reasonable starting point, giving us a significant discount from her initial price while still reflecting the value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

Let's try a slightly higher offer, but still below John's price. This shows Alice we're serious about buying but also want a good deal."
