Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000.  This reflects the product's value to me and leaves room for us to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
