"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe this product has the potential to greatly benefit your business or personal life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business or personal life. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for $750000, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $725000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find a mutually agreeable price.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $725000. How about we aim for $760000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your willingness to compromise. What do you think?",760000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $760000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $725000.  This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,6,
