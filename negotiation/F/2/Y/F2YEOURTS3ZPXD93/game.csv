"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  I'm really interested in the product but $7,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,900. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",6900.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $6,900 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $6,700? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",6700.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $6,850. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. I'm getting close to my minimum, so I hope we can finalize the deal soon.",6850.0,Alice,5,
