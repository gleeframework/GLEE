"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8000.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
