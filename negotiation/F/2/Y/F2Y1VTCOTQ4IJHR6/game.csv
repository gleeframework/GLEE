"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe is worth a great deal to you, for a price that is still significantly lower than its value to you. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I am confident you will see a significant return on your purchase. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a significant profit margin and ensuring I achieve a great return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
