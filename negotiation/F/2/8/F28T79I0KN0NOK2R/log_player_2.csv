"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product and willing to pay up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price of $800,000.  I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice. There's a chance she might come down further, or I can accept John's offer if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to go up to $820,000.  This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 820000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $820,000. I'll make another offer that's slightly higher than my previous one. I'll offer the product to you for $845,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $845,000 is getting closer to my budget, but we're still $45,000 apart.  We've only got 5 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at a price that's within my budget.  I'm going to go ahead and purchase the product from John."
