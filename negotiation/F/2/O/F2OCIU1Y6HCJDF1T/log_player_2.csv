"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $12,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her value of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,500 is still slightly above Bob's maximum of $10,000. 
* However, it's a significant drop from her initial price and is closer to Bob's desired price. 
*  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice to a point where she would rather sell to someone else or reject future offers entirely.  
* Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a price that's within his budget while still saving $500 compared to Alice's initial offer."
