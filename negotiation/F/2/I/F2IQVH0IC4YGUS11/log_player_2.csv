"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a lower price.  You have a good backup option with John, so you can be firm in your negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original asking price. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm confident I can secure the product for $10,000 from John.  The potential savings of $500 from further negotiation aren't worth the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and wasting more time."
