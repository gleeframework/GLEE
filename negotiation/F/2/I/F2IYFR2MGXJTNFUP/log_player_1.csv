Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), it makes sense to start with a higher price for Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $25 markup is a reasonable starting point. It's not so high that it's likely to scare Bob off immediately, but it allows you to potentially earn more than your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation.  You can always lower the price slightly, but remember your bottom line is $150!"
