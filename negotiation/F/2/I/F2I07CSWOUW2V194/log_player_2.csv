"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that we believe would be of great value to you. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $110 for this product. We're confident you'll find it to be an excellent investment. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $105?  That's still a fair price for the product, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To move forward, I am willing to consider your offer of $105. However, I need to ensure that we both arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement. Therefore, I propose a price of $106 for the product. This slightly exceeds your offer while still being reasonable considering the value provided by the product. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, and you've already rejected her previous offer. 
*  $106 is still within your budget of $120 and only $6 more than your initial counteroffer. 
*  It's likely that further negotiation might lead to further concessions from Alice, but there's a risk she could become less willing to deal and you'd end up paying $120 to John.
*  Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price and move on."
