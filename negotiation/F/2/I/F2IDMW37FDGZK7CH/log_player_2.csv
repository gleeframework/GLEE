Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $14,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's a good deal for you, and it's a price I can accept. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  How about we settle at $12,500?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still working for me. Let me know if that works for you."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  It's a good compromise, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very stubbornly hovering above $13,000. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that's significantly better for you, and you have a guaranteed deal at $10,000 with John."
