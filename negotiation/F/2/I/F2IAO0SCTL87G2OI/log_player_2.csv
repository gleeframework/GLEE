"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $80. Given its quality and benefits, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $80, and Alice is asking for $80. You can get the product from John for the same price, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You should reject it and buy from John."
