"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 seems a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a significant discount for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1800000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also considering your budget. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
