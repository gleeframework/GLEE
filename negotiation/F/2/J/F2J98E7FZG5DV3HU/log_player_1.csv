Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows for some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm counteroffering with $175. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've reached a point where I'm comfortable selling to John for the same amount. There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a higher counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale entirely."
