"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about $8,500 as a final offer? This is a great deal for the value you're receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses in the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed deal."
