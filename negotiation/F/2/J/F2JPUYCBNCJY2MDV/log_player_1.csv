"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the deal's value to Bob, increasing the chances of him accepting. 
* **Room for counteroffers:**  This price leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Remember:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price, but I'm also aware of John's offer, which acts as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a significant step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'm confident in my ability to reach a better deal with Bob, but I have John's offer as a safety net if the negotiations fail. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a mutually agreeable solution."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm still above my minimum but leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Clear intent:** I'm expressing a willingness to reach an agreement, showing a positive negotiating attitude.

**Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground that satisfies both of our needs. While $1,400,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, it still puts me closer to my goal than Bob's offer. This approach allows for a potential deal while still maintaining my negotiating leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,250,000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and Bob might be willing to go higher.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'm confident that I can get a better price than Bob's offer, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if needed.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming to find a middle ground that's closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher number.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,350,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" rather than a demand. This helps to keep the negotiation friendly and constructive.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Although I'm lowering my price, I'm still above my minimum and have John's offer as a fallback.

**Strategy:**  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob, as it offers a compromise and a potential agreement. If Bob still rejects, I'll need to assess whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is clearly trying to find a compromise, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm not sure how much more room for compromise there is.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'm confident that I can get a better price than Bob's offer, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if needed. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again, but I will be cautious about my price.  I will be prepared to walk away if I do not get a price that is closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This is a final offer, as I'm running out of time.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm emphasizing this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to consider accepting.
* **Reasonable compromise:** I'm lowering my offer again, showing a willingness to compromise but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Alternative options:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options, increasing the pressure to close the deal.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's limits. If he rejects, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John, as we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and the risk of losing a good deal increases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,150,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's final offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and even significantly lower than my current offer of $1,300,000.
* **Time is running out:** We are down to our final two rounds, and there's a high risk of not finding an agreeable price with Bob. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which significantly exceeds Bob's final offer. 

**Decision:**  Considering Bob's final offer, the dwindling negotiation rounds, and the secure offer from John, I will choose to **SellToJhon**.  It's the most financially advantageous decision at this point."
