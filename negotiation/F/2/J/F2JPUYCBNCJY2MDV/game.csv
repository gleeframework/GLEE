"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher number.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,350,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This is a final offer, as I'm running out of time.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
