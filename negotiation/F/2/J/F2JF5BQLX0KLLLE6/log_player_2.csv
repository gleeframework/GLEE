"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $1,150,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a middle ground between his maximum budget and Alice's likely minimum. A $100,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is now within Bob's budget and offers a good saving compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting again and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
