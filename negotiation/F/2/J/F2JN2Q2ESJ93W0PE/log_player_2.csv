Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to go with John and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
