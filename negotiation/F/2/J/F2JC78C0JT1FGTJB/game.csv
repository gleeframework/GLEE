"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $125?  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $110? That's closer to my budget and I'm sure it would still be a good deal for you.",110.0,Bob,4,
