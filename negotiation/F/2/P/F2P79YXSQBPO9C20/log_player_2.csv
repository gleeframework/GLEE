{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above my target price of $1,000,000. There are still 9 rounds left, so I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my target of $1,000,000. I have 7 rounds remaining, so I'll continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your willingness to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price,  $1,025,000 is still above my desired limit.  I have 5 rounds remaining and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. I'm ready to go to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for the value of the product and a reasonable compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'm willing to make one final push and offer you the product for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your desire to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a stalemate. Alice is insistent on $1,050,000, which is outside my target price.  I'm only left with 3 rounds, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  John is offering the product for my target price, so it's better to buy from him and avoid any more back-and-forth."
