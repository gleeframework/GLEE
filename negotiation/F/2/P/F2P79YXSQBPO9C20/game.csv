"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a fair deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your willingness to compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'm willing to make one final push and offer you the product for $1,050,000.
