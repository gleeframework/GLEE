Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price or, failing that, sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 more rounds and can always sell to John for $12,000. I'll try to push for a higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm still not at my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll accept $9,250 for the product. This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9150 for the product. I think this is the best we can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob is showing a willingness to compromise.  While $9,150 is still below my desired price, it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal. This ensures I get a reasonable price and avoid the risk of going through more rounds and potentially losing the sale."
