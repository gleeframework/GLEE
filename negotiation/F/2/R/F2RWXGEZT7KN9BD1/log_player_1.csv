This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential compromise.  It's also well above my minimum acceptable price, leaving me some leeway if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's still higher than what John is offering.  I will reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it above Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also protecting my interests."
