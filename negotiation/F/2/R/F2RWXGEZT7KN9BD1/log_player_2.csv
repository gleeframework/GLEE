You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $1,000,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good price considering his maximum willingness to pay is $1,500,000.  Further negotiation might get a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John is now higher. Accepting this offer is the best strategy for Bob."
