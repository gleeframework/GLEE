"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $13,000 is still above his budget, and he has 9 more rounds to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I need a bit more to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still try to push for a lower price. He has 7 rounds remaining and can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $10,000. This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is closer to his budget, he still has 5 rounds to negotiate a better price. He has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, so he doesn't need to settle just yet.  He can continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a reasonable price, and I think we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference this time and go with $11,250? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,250 is tempting, Bob still has 3 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get closer to his budget. He also has the option to buy from John at $8,000, giving him leverage. Bob should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,250 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750,  which is a fair offer considering we're almost halfway through our negotiations.  Let's see if we can find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant move on my part.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. He has one round left to negotiate with Alice, but Alice's offer is still $3,000 above his budget. Buying from John at $8,000 is the most cost-effective option, especially with only one round remaining."
