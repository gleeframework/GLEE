"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I need a bit more to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $10,000. This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a reasonable price, and I think we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's try to make this happen.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference this time and go with $11,250? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of this product. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,250 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750,  which is a fair offer considering we're almost halfway through our negotiations.  Let's see if we can find common ground and finalize this deal.",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant move on my part.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",11000.0,Alice,9,
