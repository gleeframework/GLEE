Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  This shows Bob you value the product and are not desperate to sell.
* **It's below Bob's maximum value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially increase the price if Bob is eager to buy. 

By offering a price close to your target, you increase the chances of a quick sale while leaving space for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the initial $950,000 but still remaining above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target value."
