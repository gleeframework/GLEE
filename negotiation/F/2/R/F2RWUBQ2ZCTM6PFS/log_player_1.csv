Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but Alice has a good cushion before reaching her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives Alice leverage.  She doesn't *have* to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This offer assumes Bob is somewhat negotiable.  If Bob is known to be a hard bargainer, Alice might start slightly lower to avoid completely turning him off.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship is important, Alice might propose a slightly lower price, fostering goodwill for future deals."
