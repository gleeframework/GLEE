Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the product for a price of $1,300,000. I believe this offer represents significant value given its potential benefits to your specific needs."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation is Impossible:**  In a real-world scenario, you wouldn't know Bob values the product at $800,000.  You have to negotiate without that information.
* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable amount ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""significant value,"" ""potential benefits"") can make the offer more persuasive. 
* **Leaving Bob Room:** While the offer is high, it still leaves Bob with the potential for a good deal if he values the product significantly higher than $1,300,000.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** This initial offer is just the first step. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to adjust your price accordingly.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Your guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000 gives you a strong fallback position. You should be less willing to drop your price significantly below that amount."
