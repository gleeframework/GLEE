"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $12,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still represents a good deal for Bob as the product is worth $15,000 to him.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering Bob at $11,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to him. I hope this will be acceptable to him, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,500.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good profit for me and it avoids further negotiation that might risk losing the deal entirely."
