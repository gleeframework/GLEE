"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds and can counteroffer, potentially getting a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Room for compromise:**  This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation in the following rounds. 
* **Avoiding John:** This is still a better option than buying from John, as I'm saving $6,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. 
* **More negotiation needed.** I have 7 rounds left and can continue to counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  I'm hoping to negotiate with Alice to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not overpaying.
* **Finding a middle ground:** This offer is closer to Alice's last offer of $11,000, indicating that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining a margin:**  This offer still leaves me some room to negotiate in the following rounds while avoiding having to buy from John."
