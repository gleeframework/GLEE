Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000.  Offering it slightly below his perceived value ($14,000) maximizes the chance of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly avoids the potential delay of going to John. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While this is a strong starting point, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to even higher profit."
