"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This seems fair considering the product's value and the fact that we both want to close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go above $975,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm proposing a price of $965,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",965000.0,Alice,5,
