"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? This price reflects the true value of the product while still being fair to both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
