"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit.  $900,000 is a significant markup but still within the realm of possibility for Bob, considering the product's worth to him.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good profit, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $900,000. I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $875,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a substantial profit. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal, making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. Let's try $860000. This still leaves some room for you while getting closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $860,000 is a good deal. It's close to my desired $900,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Given the limited rounds remaining, I'll accept his offer."
