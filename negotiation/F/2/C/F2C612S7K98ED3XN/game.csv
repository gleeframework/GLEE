"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $13,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $14,500? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $14,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,500, which would be $15,250. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,5,
