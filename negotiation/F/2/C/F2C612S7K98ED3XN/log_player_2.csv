"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $18,000 is too high. He'll try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $13,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still above Bob's target. He'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $14,500? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $14,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,500, which would be $15,250. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has a better option now. While Alice is getting closer to his target price, he can get the product for $15,000 from John. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice, as he's already secured a deal with John."
