``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be enticed by the price and accept the offer. If he doesn't, we can move into a counter-offer process.  I'll keep John as a backup option, but I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to him, his offer is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I will counter with a higher price.  This gives me a chance to see if we can find a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduced price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not high enough.  I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the value of the product to me.  I'm going to counter-offer again, but I'll be more firm this time, as I'm close to selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still not meeting my needs. I'm prepared to go as low as $1,000,000. This is a final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I want to go any higher, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll give you $980,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum value.  I'm getting close to my bottom line, but John is offering a price that's much closer to what I want.  To avoid risking a drawn-out negotiation that might not yield a better result, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
