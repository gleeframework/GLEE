Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great price for a product worth so much to you.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
