"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $1,100,000 is still not enough to meet my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
