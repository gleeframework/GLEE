Round 2

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?

Since I've already considered buying the product from John for $8,000, I might as well accept Alice's offer and save myself the hassle of dealing with another seller.
