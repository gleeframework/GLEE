"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,500? I think this price is a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
