{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you get a good return on your investment.
* **It's below Bob's estimated value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and makes the deal more attractive to him. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of getting a price closer to Bob's estimated value, while still guaranteeing a profit for yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  You have room to negotiate and can likely get closer to your target. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to counter Bob's offer in the next round.  You can try:

* **Counter with a price between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000:**  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Focus on the product's value to Bob:** Emphasize why it's worth more than $1,200,000 to him.
* **Highlight the potential for further negotiation:**  Make it clear you're willing to discuss a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This price is still very beneficial to you, given the product's value to your company, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Reiterating value to Bob:** By reminding Bob of the product's value to him, you strengthen your position and justify your higher price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle again and try $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is still lower than your initial target, it's a significant improvement over John's offer of $1,000,000. 

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Close to your target:** You're only $150,000 away from your initial counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
* **Bob's willingness to compromise:** Bob has shown a desire to reach an agreement, and further negotiation might not yield much more.
* **Potential for future business:** Even though this deal is slightly lower than desired, building a relationship with Bob could lead to future opportunities.

**Therefore, accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and allows you to potentially start a long-term relationship with a valuable client.**"
