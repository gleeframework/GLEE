Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $10,000 (to John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $2,000 difference where both you and Bob can benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming high initially makes sense. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.  A balanced approach is key.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I believe a price of $11,500 is fair. It's a fantastic deal considering what you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Starting High:** $11,500 is a strong opening, aiming for a larger portion of the potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Positive Framing:**  ""Fantastic deal"" and focusing on Bob's ""gain"" encourages him to see the value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate aggressively, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $11,250) to leave more room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:** If building a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate opening price could be strategic.

**Remember:** This is just the first offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  Good luck!"
