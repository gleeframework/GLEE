Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers to justify the high price, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Limited-Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer even if it's slightly above his valuation. 

**Important Note:**  While this offer might seem high, negotiation is a dynamic process. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you still have room to negotiate down towards his valuation or accept John's offer as your safety net."
