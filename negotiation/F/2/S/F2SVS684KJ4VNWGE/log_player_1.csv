Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you've mentioned the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Can we meet in the middle?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,300,000 is better than Bob's first offer, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also starting to think about John as a more appealing option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,300,000 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my end.  Let's try to close this deal, or I might have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob's offers have been stubbornly low.  I've made several concessions, and we're running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
