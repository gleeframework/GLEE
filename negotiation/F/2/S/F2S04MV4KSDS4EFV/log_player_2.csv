"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's an investment that truly exceeds expectations and has been designed to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its worth to you is $12,000, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both the product's value and its significance to you. Let's aim for a price closer to $10,000, which still leaves a considerable profit margin for me while ensuring you receive a product that matches its high value to you. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to a higher price by mentioning your perceived value of $12,000. 
* Her offer of $10,000 is still significantly higher than her own valuation of $8,000. 
* By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away, potentially leading to a better counter-offer.
* Even if she doesn't budge, you have John as a backup option at $12,000, which is your maximum budget."
