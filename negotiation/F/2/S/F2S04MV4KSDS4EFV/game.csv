"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's an investment that truly exceeds expectations and has been designed to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its worth to you is $12,000, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both the product's value and its significance to you. Let's aim for a price closer to $10,000, which still leaves a considerable profit margin for me while ensuring you receive a product that matches its high value to you. I look forward to your consideration.",10000.0,Alice,1,
