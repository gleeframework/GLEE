Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective. However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and $850,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I think this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $987,500. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While your last offer was close, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you be willing to consider $978,000? It's a small adjustment, but it would help me feel comfortable closing the deal.
