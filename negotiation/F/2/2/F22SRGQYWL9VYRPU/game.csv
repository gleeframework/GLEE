"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective. However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and $850,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I think this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,025,000. It's a significant amount for me.  Could we compromise at $950,000? This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget, and I truly believe this product has excellent potential.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $987,500. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $987,500 is still a bit too much.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $968,750.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",968750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While your last offer was close, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you be willing to consider $978,000? It's a small adjustment, but it would help me feel comfortable closing the deal.",978000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $978,000 is still just outside my comfort zone.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $968,750.  This seems like a fair compromise that would allow us both to close this deal.",968750.0,Bob,8,
