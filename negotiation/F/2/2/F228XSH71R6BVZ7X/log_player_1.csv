"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price well above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer will help you understand how far apart your valuations are and how willing Bob might be to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than your minimum and John's standing offer. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting and countering is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $18,000 might have been a tad high, but $10,000 undervalues the product's true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Compromise:** By significantly lowering the price from $18,000 to $14,000, we're showing Bob that we're willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $14,000 keeps us comfortably above our $12,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Encouraging Reciprocity:**  By making a substantial move, we're hoping Bob will be more inclined to make a counteroffer closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets Our Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 matches our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we could try to push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would agree. Accepting now secures us a fair deal and avoids the risk of him walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves time and effort that can be directed towards other opportunities."
