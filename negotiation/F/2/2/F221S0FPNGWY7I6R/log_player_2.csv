Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'll try to counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to the price John is offering."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer one more time, but if she rejects, I'll go with John."

Alice's offer is still too high, even with the concession.  At this point, John's offer is the best deal for me.  I'm going to buy the product from him."
