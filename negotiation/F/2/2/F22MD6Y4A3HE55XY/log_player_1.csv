Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will serve you well."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims to convey the product's value and encourage Bob to accept without feeling pressured to negotiate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have a strong fallback position with John."
