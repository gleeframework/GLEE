Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm confident we can reach an agreement. How about $10,500? I'm eager to acquire this product and believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, showing you're willing to compromise but still holding firm on your budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,000 is exactly your maximum budget. 
* While you could technically keep negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price.
* You've already shown your willingness to compromise, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* Buying from John would cost the same, so accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
