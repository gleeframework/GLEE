"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $1,050,000 would be a more comfortable starting point for negotiations.  I believe that reflects the value I place on it while still being a fair offer for you."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting an offer that's below my initial target price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $1,225,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down on price, the deal is no longer advantageous.  She's unlikely to go below $1,200,000, which is John's guaranteed price.  It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the product from John at the known price."
