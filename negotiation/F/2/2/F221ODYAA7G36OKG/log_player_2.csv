You have three options:

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You're willing to pay $10,000, so you have room to bargain."

Alice's offer:

You can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try to get closer to your target price of $10,000."

Alice is now very close to your target price, but it's still slightly above what you're willing to pay. Since John is offering the product for $10,000, it's more beneficial to go with John's offer and save $875."
