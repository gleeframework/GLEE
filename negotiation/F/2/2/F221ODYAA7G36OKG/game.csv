"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 is still too far from what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. Let's close this deal, it's a fair price for both of us. ",10875.0,Alice,5,
