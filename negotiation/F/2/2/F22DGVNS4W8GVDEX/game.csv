"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budget concerns. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while working within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,500,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. If you can meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
