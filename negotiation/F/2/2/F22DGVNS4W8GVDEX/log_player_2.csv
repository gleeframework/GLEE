Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budget concerns. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,500,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. If you can meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to your budget, her mention of another buyer at $1,500,000 suggests she might not go much lower. You're running the risk of her sticking to this price or even walking away. You have a guaranteed option with John for $1,200,000, which saves you a significant amount. 

At this point, the potential savings of trying to haggle Alice down further aren't worth the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer anyway."
