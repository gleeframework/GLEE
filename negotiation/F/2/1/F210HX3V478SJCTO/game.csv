"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a little more than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
