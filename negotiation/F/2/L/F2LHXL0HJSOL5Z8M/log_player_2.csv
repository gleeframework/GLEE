**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While she might be bluffing, it's getting too risky. We are getting close to our maximum budget, and further haggling might not yield significant results. Buying from John guarantees the product at our target price and avoids the risk of Alice not budging further."
