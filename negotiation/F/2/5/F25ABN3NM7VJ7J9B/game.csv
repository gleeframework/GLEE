"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1700000. I can do $1750000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be willing to negotiate.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
