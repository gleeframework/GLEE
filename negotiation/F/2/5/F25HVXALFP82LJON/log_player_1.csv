Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial offer, while I've made significant moves down from mine. This indicates he's likely willing to go higher than $1,850,000. I'm willing to push a bit further to try and secure a better deal, but I need to be mindful of my bottom line and the guaranteed offer from John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been very accommodating with my price adjustments to show you how much I value this partnership. However, I need you to meet me halfway here. My final offer is $1,912,500. This is a firm offer, as I'm confident in the value this product brings. I need a decision from you on this, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1912500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  It's time to show firmness.  The message clearly states this is a final offer, adding a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Justification:** The mention of ""other interested parties"" subtly leverages the fear of missing out, even though John's offer is lower.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price of $1,912,500 is a strong position. It's a significant concession from the previous offer but still well above both Bob's current offer and John's standing offer. 

This counteroffer aims to either close the deal quickly at a favorable price or give a clear signal to Bob that he needs to significantly improve his offer if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate the value you place on this partnership. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $1,912,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is clearly stuck on his initial offer and unwilling to budge significantly.  His latest counteroffer is identical to his first, completely ignoring my concessions and firm stance. This signals that:

* **Bob's Valuation is Likely Not Changing:** He may be unwilling or unable to go higher, even with the risk of losing the deal. 
* **Further Negotiation is Unlikely to be Fruitful:**  Bob is unlikely to suddenly agree to a price closer to my target.
* **Time is Valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob when there's a guaranteed offer on the table is risky. I could lose both deals by waiting too long. 

Therefore, accepting John's offer of $1,500,000 is the most logical decision at this point. While it's less than I aimed for, it's a guaranteed and respectable profit, avoiding the potential for a worse outcome by continuing with Bob."
