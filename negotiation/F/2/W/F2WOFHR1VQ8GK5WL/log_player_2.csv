"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm currently only able to offer $800,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the initial price I offered. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to my target price, I'm still not at a point where I want to accept. There are still plenty of rounds remaining for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still unable to go that high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. This is my final offer for this round. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to sell you the product. If not, I'll consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a lower price. There are only 5 rounds remaining, but I believe I can still push for a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will work for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $850,000, which would be $875,000. This is my final offer for this round. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to sell you the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation, with only 3 rounds remaining. Alice's offer of $875,000 is within my acceptable range and only $25,000 above my last counteroffer.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a favorable price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
