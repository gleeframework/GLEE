This is a tough one, but it's better to take the sure thing at this point. Here's why:

* **Bob's Final Offer:** His language suggests he's serious about walking away. 
* **Limited Rounds:** You only have two rounds left, and there's no guarantee you'll get closer to $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** $1,075,000 is still a significant profit over your minimum.

While there's a chance you could squeeze a bit more from Bob, the risk of him walking away and getting only $1,200,000 from John is too high."
