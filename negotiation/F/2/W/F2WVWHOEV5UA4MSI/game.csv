"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value to me and your desired profit margin.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
