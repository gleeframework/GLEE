"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $12,000. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. You should counteroffer and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $11,000, which is still above her value of $10,000 but significantly lower than her initial offer of $12,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $13,000 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $11,000. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,500. This is still a good deal for me, as it's less than the $13,000 Alice is offering, and it's closer to my previous offer of $11,000. This signals that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay Alice's full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  While it's a slight decrease from her previous offer, it's still significantly above my desired price point. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $12,000. This is a middle ground between my previous offer of $11,500 and Alice's current offer of $13,250. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to meet me in the middle, as it's a fair compromise for both of us."
