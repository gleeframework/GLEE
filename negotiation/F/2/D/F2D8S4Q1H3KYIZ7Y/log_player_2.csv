Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal considering the value it brings to your business.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems unwilling to go below $10,000.  She's incrementally moving towards her desired price, and we're running out of rounds. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from Alice than John's offer."
