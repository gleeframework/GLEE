Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it is below my minimum value. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still above my minimum value, but shows I'm willing to compromise. This hopefully incentivizes Bob to raise his offer, as $130 is closer to his offer of $100 than my previous offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is refusing to budge from his initial offer of $100. I've already lowered my price to $130, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's better for me to accept John's offer of $120, which is still above my minimum value and guarantees a sale without further negotiation."
