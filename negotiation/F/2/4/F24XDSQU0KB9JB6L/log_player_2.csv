"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115.  It's a great deal for something worth so much! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $102.50?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is meeting us halfway, which is good, but we're still above our budget. Let's see if we can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do it for $95? That's the most I can offer."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're nudging the price closer to our target while acknowledging Alice's compromise.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is the absolute lowest I can go.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met our target price of $100. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as we won't find a better deal."
