Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product without revealing your absolute bottom line. This creates room for negotiation while suggesting the price is justified.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. If Bob counter-offers, you can gauge his interest and adjust accordingly, knowing you have John as a safety net."
