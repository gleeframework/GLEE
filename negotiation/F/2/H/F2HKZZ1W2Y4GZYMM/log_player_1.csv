Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I wouldn't sell it for less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values it at $8,000.
* **John's Value:**  John is a backup buyer who values it at $15,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm offering a price of $12,000. This is a compromise:
    * It's higher than what Bob values the product at, potentially incentivizing him to buy.
    * It's lower than what I'd get from John, but still a significant profit.

**Outcome:**

This strategy gives me the best chance of maximizing profit. If Bob accepts, I make $12,000. If he rejects, I can still sell to John and make $15,000."
