Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to potentially gain a higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob while also making it clear that I'm open to discussion. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  By starting at $1,000,000, I set a high initial bar and leave space for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** Highlighting the value for Bob increases the likelihood of a positive response.
* **Maintain flexibility:** Leaving the door open for counteroffers allows me to adjust my price if necessary.
* **Avoid immediate deal with John:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but it might be possible to get a better price from Bob through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I can only afford to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this revised price aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss for me.  

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counter:**  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  This keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially reach a more favorable agreement. 
* **Consider John's offer:**  While my goal is to maximize profit, I'm not afraid to walk away from a bad deal. John's offer provides a safety net and a benchmark for my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $950,000, which is significantly closer to my minimum than Bob's last offer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob to make my offer seem more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, signaling that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the Gap:**  The $950,000 price point narrows the difference between our positions.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Keep the Dialogue Open:**  My message encourages continued negotiation, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose $900,000 as a compromise. This price still allows you a good profit margin while keeping within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's still not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise and allows me to make a good profit. 

**Strategy:**

* **Accept and Secure a Deal:**  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale. Further negotiation might risk losing Bob altogether, and while John's offer is higher, it's not guaranteed. 
* **Minimize Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of not selling the product at all.  

While I would prefer a higher price, I'm acknowledging the reality of the situation and making a pragmatic decision that benefits my overall financial goals."
