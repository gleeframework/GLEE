I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's been six rounds, and Bob is not willing to budge much further from his initial offer.  I'm happy to take the guaranteed $120 from John and avoid the risk of getting less from Bob."
