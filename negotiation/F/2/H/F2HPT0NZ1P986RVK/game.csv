"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you think about going down to $102? That's as high as I'm willing to go.,102.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $102 is still too low for me. Let's try $104, which is a fair compromise and closer to my value. What do you think?",104.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to giving up on negotiating, but I'll try one more time. Can you meet me at $103? That's my final offer.",103.0,Bob,6,
