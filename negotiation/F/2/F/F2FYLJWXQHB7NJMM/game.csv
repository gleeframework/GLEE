"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value you've placed on it, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit away from your latest offer. I'm willing to make another adjustment and meet you at $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,225,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price, given the product's value to you and my budget constraints.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
