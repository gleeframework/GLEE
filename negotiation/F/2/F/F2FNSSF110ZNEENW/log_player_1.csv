"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves some room for negotiation while still giving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is still a fair price for Bob, as he values the product at $100, and it's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still not ideal, it's above my minimum price of $100 and we're running out of rounds.  It's better to take the $95 now than risk getting nothing if we continue."
