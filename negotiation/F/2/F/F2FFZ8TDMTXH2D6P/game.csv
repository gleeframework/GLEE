"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to be upfront with you - I'm looking for $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $900,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
