Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $900,000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves room for you to profit significantly, and it's a fair price given the product's potential. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $975,000 is closer to my desired price point, I'm still not quite there yet. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within your budget. I'm confident this is a fair offer that will lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and we are getting close to her likely bottom line. Accepting at $1,025,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
