"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  My price is $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while buying the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $115 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **Option 1 (Accept Offer):**  This would be a bad decision as Bob would pay more than his maximum limit.
* **Option 3 (Buy from John):** This is also a bad decision at this point, as it's the same price as John's offer but Bob could potentially get a better deal from Alice through negotiation.
* **Option 2 (Reject Offer):** This allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

Bob should counteroffer with a price that is closer to his limit (e.g., $110) and see if Alice accepts."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:** Bob is trying to secure the product for as close to his maximum limit ($120) as possible. A counteroffer of $110 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still being within Bob's range.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and polite while firmly stating Bob's position."
