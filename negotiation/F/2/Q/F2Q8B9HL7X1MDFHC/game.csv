"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  This product truly offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to its true worth would be fairer. How about we meet halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $16,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm happy to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
