"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Would you like to accept this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying well below our $120 maximum. Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with an offer of $125. This is the best I can do at this time. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. We're close enough to our John fallback that we can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $110."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're nudging closer to our limit while still signaling that we're willing to negotiate. This keeps the door open for a deal with Alice while keeping us in a good position to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if I can make it work for us both. How about $115? This is my final offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! We're getting the product for $5 less than our John fallback. It's time to accept and seal the deal."
