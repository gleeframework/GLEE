"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,800 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,800 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,200 and my original offer of $10,800. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $11,000 is a good price, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  It's better to close the deal now rather than risk further negotiation and potential deadlock."
