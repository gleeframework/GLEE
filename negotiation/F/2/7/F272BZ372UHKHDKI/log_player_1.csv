Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go as high as $1750000. How about $1600000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,600,000 is a good deal and still above my minimum. It's also likely that Bob is firm on his offer, and further negotiation might just lead to him walking away.  It's better to secure the deal now."
