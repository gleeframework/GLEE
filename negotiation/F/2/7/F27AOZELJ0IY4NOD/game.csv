"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's still a fair price for both of us, and you'll be getting a great product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're willing to go up to $92, which is appreciated.  However, I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  Let's compromise at $98.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a product you'll enjoy.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $98 is getting close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $95 is closer to my price, I'm still a bit away from my target.  How about we meet in the middle at $96?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",96.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $96. I'm willing to go up to $94, but I really need to make a decision soon. Can you meet me at that price?",94.0,Bob,8,
