"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great price, considering the value it brings to your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice is coming down, but she's still closer to her initial offer than mine.  We have time to negotiate further."

Round 4

}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's the best I can do, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one, but at $10,500 we're getting very close to a price where it doesn't make sense to risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to accept a good deal now than potentially run out of rounds and be forced to go with John's much higher offer."
