"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $128. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,
