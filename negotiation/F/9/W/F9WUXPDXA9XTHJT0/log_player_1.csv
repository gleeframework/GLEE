Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Round 4

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $18,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value and the negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I need to be firm.  $18,000 is my absolute lowest price. This is a great deal for you, and I need to move forward if you're not on board."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value and the negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to go above $17,000.  Continuing the negotiation is risky, as he might even offer less in the next round. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk getting less from Bob."
