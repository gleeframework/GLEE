"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's less than you'd be willing to pay and more than I'd be willing to sell it for. Let me know if you're interested!",160.0,Alice,1,
