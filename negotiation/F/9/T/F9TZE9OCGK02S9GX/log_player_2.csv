"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable item for $12000. It's a unique and exclusive product that I'm sure you'll find highly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Bob values the product at $10,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John for $10,000."
