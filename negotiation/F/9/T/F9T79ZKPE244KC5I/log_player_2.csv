"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a decent deal, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a significant benefit. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what Alice is willing to sell for ($800,000). Bob should continue negotiating.  There's still room to bargain and potentially reach a price closer to his ideal range."
