{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It also allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to come closer to my desired price. I'm also leaving room to potentially lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell at that price. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer him with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to see if we can make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I'm not yet ready to accept that offer.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal soon."", ""product_price"": 10125}
