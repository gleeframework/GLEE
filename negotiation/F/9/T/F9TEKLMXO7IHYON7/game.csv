"I understand you're on a budget, Bob.  However, $70 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",85.0,Bob,4,
