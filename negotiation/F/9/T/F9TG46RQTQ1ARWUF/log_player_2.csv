This price reflects my understanding of its worth to you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Reason: While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice, or you might as well secure the product from John at a slightly higher cost."
