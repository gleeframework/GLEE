"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is far below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can get closer to that with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product for $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as it's the value I get from selling to John. It's also a significant drop from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I want to keep trying with Bob, as there's potential to reach a better deal.  I believe I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $1,100,000. This shows I'm flexible and willing to meet Bob halfway, but it still leaves a decent margin for me. I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still below it. There are a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to offer $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, showing Bob that I am seriously considering his offers. However, it's still within my acceptable range and leaves me with a decent profit. With only a few rounds left, I'm pushing to see if we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision.  While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to cover my ideal profit margin.  I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000.  This guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which might not yield a better outcome."
