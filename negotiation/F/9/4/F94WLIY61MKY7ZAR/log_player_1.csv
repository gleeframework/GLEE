Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer sets a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $80, ensuring a profit. However, there's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he values the product highly."
