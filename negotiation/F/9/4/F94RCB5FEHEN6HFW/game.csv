"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85,  which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. I've already come down from my initial price.  $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $81? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $81. Would you be willing to consider a price of $79?",79.0,Bob,6,
