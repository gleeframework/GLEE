Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and ensures that Bob has an incentive to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $900,000 still leaves room for Bob to counteroffer and for me to make concessions while still exceeding my minimum price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While offering a lower price might increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, it also reduces my potential earnings.  Starting higher allows me to explore a wider range of outcomes.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. This gives me a safety net and a point of reference for my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to what I know the product is worth to me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $800,000 is a good deal for Bob, it is not acceptable to me as it falls below my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **John's offer is still valid:**  The safety net of John's $1,000,000 offer gives me leverage in continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still more than what you initially offered.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** By offering $850,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $800,000.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm encouraging Bob to act quickly by suggesting that this is a fair and final offer.
* **Staying above the minimum:**  $850,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,000,000, allowing me to potentially gain more.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely monitoring Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll re-evaluate my strategy, possibly making another counteroffer or choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000."
