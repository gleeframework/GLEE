Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate above that. Aiming for a higher price with Bob initially allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $19,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. He might not reach your full asking price but could settle on a number higher than $15,000.
* **Strong Opening:** Presenting a confident initial offer can make Bob take your offer more seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, consider his potential budget and how motivated he might be to purchase.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer. You might need to adjust your price slightly downward to secure the deal, keeping your $15,000 safety net in mind."
