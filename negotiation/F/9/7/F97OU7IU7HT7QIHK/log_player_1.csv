Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate but is still a significant profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a ""deal,"" Alice subtly implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't take this offer."
