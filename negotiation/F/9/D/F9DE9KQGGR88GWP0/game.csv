"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you're serious about this, and I value that.  While $1,800,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident this product will yield even greater returns for you. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your confidence in the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm also eager to find a solution that works for both of us. How about this:  $1,875,000, and we have a deal. This reflects the value I know this product holds and demonstrates my commitment to finding a win-win solution.",1875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still negotiating. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,825,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1825000.0,Bob,6,
