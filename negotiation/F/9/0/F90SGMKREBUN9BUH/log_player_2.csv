Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm offering a new price of $850,000. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000. It's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at the guaranteed price from John."
