Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and holds significant value for someone like you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. Given its potential, I think it's a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price ($950,000) creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob, as it's still significantly less than his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is my initial offer, there might be room for slight negotiation if Bob counters, bringing the final price closer to my $1,000,000 goal."
