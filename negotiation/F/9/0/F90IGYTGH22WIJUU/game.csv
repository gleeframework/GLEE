"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm happy to make a counteroffer of $950,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and its benefits to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $950,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, which is $25,000 above your offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
