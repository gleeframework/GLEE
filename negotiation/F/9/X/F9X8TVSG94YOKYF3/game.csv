"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its value and what I'm able to spend. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
