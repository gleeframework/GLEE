Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth a significant amount more than this offer, but I'm willing to part with it for $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, so you should only sell to Bob if he's willing to pay more.
* **Starting high:** It's always better to start with a higher offer and potentially negotiate down. By starting at $170, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message is phrased to gauge Bob's interest without revealing your absolute bottom line. It implies the product is valuable and encourages Bob to counter-offer if he's interested. 

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're still in a strong position to negotiate or accept John's offer."
