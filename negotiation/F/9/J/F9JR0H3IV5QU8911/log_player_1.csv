Bob is clearly interested and negotiating within a reasonable range. We're getting closer to a potential agreement, but there's still room to push for a better price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,975,000

While we're close to the desired price, Bob is unlikely to move much further. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above John's offer, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away."
