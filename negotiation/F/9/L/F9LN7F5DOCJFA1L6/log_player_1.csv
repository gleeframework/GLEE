Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $2,200,000 represents a significant discount on the true value and potential this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but $1,950,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

}
``` 

Explanation: Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's in our best interest to cut our losses and sell to John rather than risk Bob's negotiations going even lower."
