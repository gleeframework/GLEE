"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If not, I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with the $120, I'd like to see if I can get a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. While I could potentially get a higher price in a few more rounds, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely. It's better to take the $130 now."
