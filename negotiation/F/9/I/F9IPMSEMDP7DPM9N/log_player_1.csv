I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how Bob responds and what his perceived value is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm offering $17,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum value of $15,000. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. I'd rather not risk further negotiation and lose even more money. Selling to John for $15,000 is the best option in this situation, as it guarantees me my minimum value."
