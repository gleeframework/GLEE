"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts with a price that's a good middle ground between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below my minimum value of $80.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $92.50, which is right in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $90? That's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value of $80 and closer to my desired price.  It's also a fair deal considering his initial offer of $85.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with the same or a lower offer in the next round."
