Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive since the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $90. While I'd prefer more, this is a good outcome considering my minimum price and the potential for more back-and-forth negotiation."
