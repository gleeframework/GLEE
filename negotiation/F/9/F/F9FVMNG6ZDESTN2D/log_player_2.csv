"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $135. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While the product is worth $150 to you, Alice is offering it for $135. This means you'll save $15 compared to buying from John. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  The product is worth $120 to Alice, and you're buying it for $135. This means you're paying more than its value to her, but less than its value to you."
