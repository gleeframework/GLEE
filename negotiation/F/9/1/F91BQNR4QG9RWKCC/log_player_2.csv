Round 2

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm more comfortable in the range of $6,000. Would you be open to that?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $9,000. This is a compromise I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a lower price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer with a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  Since we have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price than to continue negotiating with Alice."
