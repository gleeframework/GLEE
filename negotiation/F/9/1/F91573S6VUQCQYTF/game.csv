"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its quality and features, I'm offering it at $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your position, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000. I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the true value of this product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be honest,  $11,000 is the highest I can go. If that's not workable for you, I understand.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $11,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we settle at $15,500? This would be a significant compromise on my end, but I value finding common ground.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a compromise.  While $15,500 is getting closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
