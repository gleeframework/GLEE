Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization for Alice.
* **Limited Time Offer:** The message subtly implies scarcity and urgency by mentioning ""other interested parties."" This could incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Confident Tone:**  Alice's message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception of its worth. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point for negotiation. Alice needs to be prepared to potentially lower the price depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics. However, having John as a guaranteed backup buyer provides Alice with a strong position."
