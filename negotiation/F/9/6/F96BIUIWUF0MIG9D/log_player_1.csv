{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm happy to offer it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $150 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off with an outrageous price right away. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can adjust your price down a bit in subsequent counteroffers.

Remember, you can always choose to walk away and sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still quite a bit below my desired price.  I'm going to try and negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $135?  That's a good price for both of us, and it's still well above what I'd get elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$130 is a good price and not too far off from my counter offer.  I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
