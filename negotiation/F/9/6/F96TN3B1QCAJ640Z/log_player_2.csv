Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. However, $1,150,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,180,000, which reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this.

Alice has come down to $1,180,000 which is a better price than what John is offering. It's not the best possible price, but it's a good deal considering the value of the product to you."
