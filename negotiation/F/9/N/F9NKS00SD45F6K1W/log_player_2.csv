"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so it's worth attempting a counteroffer to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and aligns with my financial limitations.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking a price of $1,075,000 would be a fair compromise. This way, you'll get the product at a great value, and I'll still make a significant profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is still within Bob's budget and significantly better than the $1,200,000 price from John.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $25,000.  While there might be a tiny chance of getting a lower price with another counteroffer, the risk of Alice rejecting and forcing Bob to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
