"I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and aligns with my financial limitations.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking a price of $1,075,000 would be a fair compromise. This way, you'll get the product at a great value, and I'll still make a significant profit.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
