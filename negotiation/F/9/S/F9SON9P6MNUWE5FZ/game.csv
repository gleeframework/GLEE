"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a significant return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, which is a significant discount from your original offer. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000, so I'll offer $850,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, at $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's reach an agreement so we can both move forward.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Bob,6,
