"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, and it's a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
