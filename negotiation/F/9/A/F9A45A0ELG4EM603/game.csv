"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $127. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",127.0,Alice,5,
