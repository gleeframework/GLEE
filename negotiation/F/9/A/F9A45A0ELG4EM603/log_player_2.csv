Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $127. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly signaling that she's nearing her bottom line. Accepting at $127 is a decent compromise, saving me $23 compared to John's offer."
