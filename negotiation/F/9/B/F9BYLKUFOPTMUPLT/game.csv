"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value our potential deal, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go above $10,000 for the product. Could we perhaps discuss other terms or conditions that might make the deal more favorable for both of us?",10000.0,Bob,4,
