{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum value ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives Bob a good deal and still allows me to make a decent profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product. This helps to build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just my initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and his counteroffers. I am also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is still a profit, it's significantly lower than my desired outcome. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum value. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will counter Bob's offer, attempting to find a price that is more acceptable to both of us. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value our potential deal, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This is a compromise between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000).  This price is closer to my minimum value and still offers Bob a good deal.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the win-win nature of the deal. It also acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while proposing a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go above $10,000 for the product. Could we perhaps discuss other terms or conditions that might make the deal more favorable for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been firm on his price of $10,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, further rounds are unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.  

Therefore, to maximize my profit, I will sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I achieve my desired outcome and avoid further potential losses."
