"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is a significant amount more than what the product is worth to Alice.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value as possible. A starting offer of $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has already shown willingness to go lower, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better deal for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is a fair middle ground between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer. This strategy aims to find a price point that is agreeable to both parties while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, and the offer is close to his value. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit lower. There's a good chance that Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but only slightly. This shows that he is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. By offering $10,750, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise while also aiming for a price closer to his desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could continue to negotiate, $10,900 is a good price. It is just slightly above Alice's perceived value and significantly lower than Bob's alternative option with John. At this point, continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal, as Alice might become less willing to compromise. It's better for Bob to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
