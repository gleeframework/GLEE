Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you and Bob, aiming higher initially allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. You can afford to be bolder with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it implies significant value (""immense value and potential""). This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and engage in a discussion about the product's worth.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might outright reject the initial price, but it opens the door for a counter-offer and a potential deal above your minimum."
