"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a competitive price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still beyond what I can afford right now. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. If you're not willing to accept this, I may have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
