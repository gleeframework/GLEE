"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I would like to propose a price of $950,000. This allows me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,025,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,010,000 as a final compromise. This is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
