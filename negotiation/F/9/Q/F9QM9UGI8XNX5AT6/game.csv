"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $180 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on my offer of $100.  It's the maximum I can pay for this product. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to move on.",100.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,130.0
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $130. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me halfway.",130.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115, which is a fair compromise.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",115.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,125.0
"I'm glad you think $115 is a fair compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115, which is $122.50. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",122.5,Alice,7,,
