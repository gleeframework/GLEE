"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to go slightly above my initial offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $14,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14250.0,Alice,7,
