# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This price is a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $1,200,000 and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This means you can save $200,000 by accepting her offer.
* **While you could reject Alice's offer and see if she lowers her price, there's no guarantee she will.**  You risk ending up paying John's higher price.
* **Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sound decision.** It secures the product at the best possible price for you."
