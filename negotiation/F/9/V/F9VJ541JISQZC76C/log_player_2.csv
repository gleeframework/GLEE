**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **You can still get a good deal:** While you might be able to haggle with Alice further,  $12,000 is still within your budget and represents a good savings."
