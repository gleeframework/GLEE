"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a great starting point. Let me know if you're interested!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This leaves room for both of us to profit, and it's a price I believe is fair considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
