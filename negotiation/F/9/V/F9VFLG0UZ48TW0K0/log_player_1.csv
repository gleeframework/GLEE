Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This leaves room for both of us to profit, and it's a price I believe is fair considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
