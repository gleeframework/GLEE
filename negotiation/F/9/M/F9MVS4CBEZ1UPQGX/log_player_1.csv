Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (which is significant) while still earning Alice a $150,000 profit over her minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is confident John will definitely buy the product for $1,200,000 if Bob declines."
