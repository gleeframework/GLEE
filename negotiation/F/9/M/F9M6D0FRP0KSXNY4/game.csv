"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
