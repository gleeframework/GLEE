"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a beneficial asset for you. To begin negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  A high initial offer sets a strong anchor point. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it gives us room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above our minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We understand Bob's value is lower, so this offer signals our willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000) if negotiations fail, which allows us to be more assertive in our approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, leaving us no room for profit. While it's tempting to accept $1,200,000, we have a strong alternative with John's offer. We still have time to negotiate and aim for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession from our initial offer, showing Bob we're serious about negotiating. However, the drop is calculated to keep us well above his initial offer.
* **Holding Ground:**  While we're flexible, we're not coming close to his $1,200,000. Our counteroffer reinforces the product's high value and signals we're aiming for a significantly higher price.
* **Time Consideration:** We're still early in the negotiation (Round 3). This gives us room to continue maneuvering before considering John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $1,500,000. I think that's the maximum I can justify for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but no further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Goal:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's offer, ensuring we get our minimum desired price.
* **Limited Upside:** While we could try to push Bob further, it's unlikely he'll go significantly higher. His message suggests he's firm at $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling, potentially forcing us to accept a lower price from John later. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome given the current situation."
