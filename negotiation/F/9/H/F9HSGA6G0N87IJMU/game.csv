"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $875,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair transaction.  What are your thoughts?",875000.0,Alice,3,
