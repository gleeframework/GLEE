"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and reflects my genuine interest in the product.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
