"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer. This gives you leverage to walk away from the negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and reflects its value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is above his perceived value, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* We're still significantly above John's guaranteed offer, giving us room to counter. 
* Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive and allows us to guide it closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant step down from our initial offer ($300,000 decrease) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Ground:**  We're still significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message continues to emphasize the product's value to justify the price without providing specific details that Bob could use against us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and reflects my genuine interest in the product.  Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now $100,000 higher than what John is guaranteed to pay.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product.  
* **Time Value of Money:** Accepting now avoids the risk of further negotiation and secures a very good price.

While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's offer ($1,500,000) makes accepting Bob's current offer the most strategically sound decision."
