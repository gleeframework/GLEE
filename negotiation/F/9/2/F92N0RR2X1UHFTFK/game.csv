"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given the potential of this product, I'm willing to offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm seeking for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the product's potential.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
