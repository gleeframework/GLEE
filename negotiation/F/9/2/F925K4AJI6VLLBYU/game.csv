"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95 for it, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product, which is closer to our meeting point. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $100. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $115. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",115.0,Alice,7,
