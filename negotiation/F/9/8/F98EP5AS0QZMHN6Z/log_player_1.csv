Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** While I can guarantee $15,000 from John, I can potentially earn more by convincing Bob to buy.
* **Minimize risk:** The offer is low enough that Bob might be tempted, but not so low that I lose a significant amount of money if he rejects. 
* **Consider negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price slightly or offer him additional incentives, depending on how much I want to prioritize selling to him over John."
