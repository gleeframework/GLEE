"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There is still room for negotiation, as Alice's value for the product is $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $1,300,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,350,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Rejecting this offer could lead to a protracted negotiation with no guarantee of a lower price. Bob could also end up buying from John at a higher price.

While Bob could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer minimizes risk and achieves a reasonable price within his budget."
