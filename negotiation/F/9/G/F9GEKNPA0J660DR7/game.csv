"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $15000. Let's see if we can close the deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $18000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $17500, and I'll include a free maintenance package worth $1000?",17500.0,Alice,5,
