Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Giving Bob some room to negotiate will make him feel like he's getting a good deal, encouraging him to accept.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This gives you some flexibility to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your target.
* **It's clear and concise:**  A simple message that focuses on the price makes the offer easy for Bob to understand."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, you can still potentially get a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a slightly higher price and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your counteroffer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a proposal of $1,060,000 for your product. I believe this strikes a balance between the value of the product and our respective positions. I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance that continuing to haggle will either lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
