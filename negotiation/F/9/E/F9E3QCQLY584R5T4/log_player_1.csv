Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't fully reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1120000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,120,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,080,000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer to the million mark, but we're still in early rounds. Showing a willingness to walk away maintains a strong negotiating position and might encourage Bob to offer a more substantial increase in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand the value of what I'm offering.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000, but this is absolutely my final offer.  Let's close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're meeting halfway now, signaling a willingness to compromise, but also establishing a firm boundary. The ""final offer"" tactic adds pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to pay $1,090,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While there's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, the risk of him walking away increases significantly if we reject this offer.  $1,090,000 is a strong profit, and it's better to secure the deal now than potentially lose him in later rounds."
