"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a bit more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still less than what I want. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,800. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  I'm hoping that he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a slightly higher price.  I want to see if I can push for $13,500 or at least meet him in the middle at $13,400."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above what Bob offered.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and how much I believe Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not sure if I want to take the risk of him walking away. It's better to see if I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since I only have 4 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm offering $13,250. This is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept the deal, since we only have a few rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum.  While I'd prefer to make a profit closer to my initial goal, I'm better off securing the guaranteed $15,000 with John."
