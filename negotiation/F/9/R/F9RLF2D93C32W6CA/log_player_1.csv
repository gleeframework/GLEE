"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) and what Bob is willing to pay ($80). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:** By starting high, I create a baseline and leave room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially reaching a price that's mutually beneficial.  
* **Staying Open:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by saying ""Would you be interested..."" rather than making a firm demand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I could sell to John for $100, I still see potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob.
* **Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $105, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Staying Flexible:** The message expresses willingness to negotiate further while still indicating a firm position. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Close to the Deal:** We're getting closer, and I see potential to reach a price that's acceptable to both of us with another round of negotiation.
* **Avoiding Premature Exit:** While selling to John for $100 is a safe option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making a final offer at my minimum price point of $100. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing this offer as a win-win for both of us.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is the best offer I can make, pushing Bob to accept or reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Small Increment:** Bob's offer is only $2 higher than his previous offer, which suggests he's not willing to budge significantly.
* **Guarantee:**  While I could keep negotiating, I'm guaranteed a sale to John for $100. It's not ideal, but it's a safe option given the limited time and Bob's resistance."
