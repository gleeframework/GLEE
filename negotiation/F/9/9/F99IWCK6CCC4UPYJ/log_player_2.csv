"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high.  While the product is worth $15,000 to you, it's in your best interest to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting her offer and providing a counteroffer is the best way to potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation.  It also conveys that I'm interested in the product, but not at the initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. Could you do $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate.  We're closer to a price that works for both of us, so continuing the negotiation makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

We're splitting the difference here to show Alice we're willing to compromise but still want a good deal. This keeps the negotiation moving and aims for a price point beneficial to both parties."
