"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500? That's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a good price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $10,200, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise and come down to $10,750. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product while being fair to both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to accept this offer and finalize the deal.",10750.0,Alice,7,
