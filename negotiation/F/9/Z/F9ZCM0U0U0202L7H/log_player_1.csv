Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves space for potential counteroffers and adjustments while staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly encouraging Bob to accept. 
 
By starting high, I can gauge Bob's willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is above my minimum, it's a significant drop from my initial offer. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate, but I believe there's room to push for a higher price. I'll counter to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $100 is a fair offer, the value of this product is considerably higher. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's offer as ""fair"" to build rapport but stand firm that the product is worth more.  Proposing a middle ground at $115 shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price point.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I haven't drastically dropped my price, signaling that I'm not desperate to sell below a certain threshold.  
* **Guiding the Negotiation:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to the $100-$115 range, which remains a profitable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $115. How about we try $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:**  $105 is a reasonable profit above my minimum price ($80), and significantly closer to my counteroffer than Bob's initial offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above $105. It's not worth risking the deal for a potentially small gain. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations has a cost. Accepting now secures a good profit and allows me to move on to other potential sales."
