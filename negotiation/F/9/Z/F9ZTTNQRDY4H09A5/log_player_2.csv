"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Alice's offer.  $130 is too high for me, and I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice,  $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer. $122.50 is still a bit higher than I wanted, but it's closer to my target price and  better than buying from John for $150."
