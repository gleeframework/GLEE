"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  While $8500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to keep the product in your hands.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $8800 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to come up to $9000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's find a way to make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $8800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about we try $8950? This is as high as I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in the product and want to make a deal work.",8950.0,Bob,6,
