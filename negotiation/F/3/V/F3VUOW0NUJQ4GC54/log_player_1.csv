{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiating, which could lead to a better outcome for both of us. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and doesn't reflect the value of the product.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still get a higher price by counter-offering. Bob is interested in the product and willing to negotiate. 
* **John as leverage:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer strengthens my position. 

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to keep the product in your hands."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us,  appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  The price is still above Bob's initial offer, reminding him that I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $8,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially with John as a backup buyer. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer has some risk, but the potential reward of a higher price is worth it. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to come up to $9,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Firmness:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his last proposal. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that the price is fair and will result in a positive outcome for both of us,  encouraging a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not moving significantly lower, reminding Bob that I have other options (John) and am not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $8800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about we try $8950? This is as high as I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in the product and want to make a deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate, where neither of us is willing to budge. This could drag out the process and potentially lead to a lower final price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my desired profit and removes the risk of further negotiations with Bob.
* **Prioritizing Certainty:** Given Bob's repeated rejection of my offers, even with a compromise, it's clear that he is unlikely to reach my minimum price. 

Selling to John is the most prudent decision, ensuring a quick and profitable outcome."
