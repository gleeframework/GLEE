"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1300000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $100,000 over Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1150000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1250000?  This price allows for a fair profit for me and ensures we both benefit from this transaction. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still $50,000 over his limit.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
