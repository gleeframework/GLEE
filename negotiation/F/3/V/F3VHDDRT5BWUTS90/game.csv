"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  It's a valuable product with a lot of potential, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while still being fair to you.  Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is still below what I need to accept.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's close this deal!",850000.0,Alice,5,
