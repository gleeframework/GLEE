"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving space for negotiation prevents me from immediately being stuck at a price below my minimum of $150. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting by taking advantage of the potential ""first-mover advantage"" to establish a strong initial price point. However, I'm also open to negotiation, as I don't want to risk losing Bob altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $125 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I can still try to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price.  
* **John is a safety net:** If I can't reach a deal with Bob, I have John as a backup, guaranteeing me my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

My priority is to maximize profit. Since Bob's offer is below my threshold, I'll reject it and try to leverage the remaining rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price. John's offer provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This is still a fair price for both of us, and it's a good opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a great value."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise and emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach shows I'm willing to negotiate and reduces the gap between our offers.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm still protecting my profits.

**Strategy:**

By proposing a compromise and meeting halfway, I aim to make my offer more appealing to Bob while staying within my acceptable price range.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting the best price possible and not risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $127? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $127 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, there's less time to negotiate further.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed win:** Selling to John for $150 ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of a lower offer.

**Strategy:**

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is still too low. I'm approaching the point where the remaining time to negotiate is limited, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price below my minimum. Selling to John is the safest option to secure my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $127 is still below my minimum.  To be fair, I'm willing to go down to $132. This is the very best I can do, and it's a good opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Stand:**  I'm making this my final counteroffer, highlighting that I'm going as low as I can. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Small Compromise:**  While $132 is still above my minimum, it's a slight compromise to show I'm still open to negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the worth of the price.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a risk by going down to $132, but I'm trying to make it clear that this is my absolute lowest price. I'm hoping that the urgency and the emphasis on the product's value will convince Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'll still have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $128? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds left, the pressure to close the deal is increasing.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $128 is still too low for me.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of another low offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to maximize my profit by selling to John. While I've tried to negotiate with Bob, his offers are consistently below my acceptable range.  The remaining rounds are limited, and I don't want to risk a worse outcome. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
