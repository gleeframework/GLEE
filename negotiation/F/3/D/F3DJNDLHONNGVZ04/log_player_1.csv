"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob values the product and if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility while also indicating that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a higher price, this offer is significantly closer to my ideal price point than John's offer and  it's worth closing the deal sooner rather than continuing to negotiate."
