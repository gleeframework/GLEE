"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 right now. This is my best offer considering my budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
