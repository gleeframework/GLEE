Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Value:** $12,000 (The minimum she'll accept)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $10,000 (The maximum he's willing to pay)
* **John's Valuation:** $12,000 (Alice's guaranteed backup)

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice has a strong position because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her reservation value.  This means Alice doesn't need to settle for anything less than $12,000. However, there's an opportunity to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I believe it's a great deal at $11,500.  This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Creating a Sense of Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other buyers, Alice subtly creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Pricing Above Bob's Valuation:** The price is set above Bob's $10,000 valuation but below Alice's $12,000 minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is firm, the ""limited-time"" aspect suggests there might be a slight wiggle room if Bob counters.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If Bob is very risk-averse, he might accept the offer rather than lose the opportunity. 
* **Relationship Dynamics:** If Alice has a long-term business relationship with Bob, she might adjust her approach to maintain goodwill. 

**Outcome**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $11,500 offer.
* **Acceptable Case:** Bob negotiates slightly down, and they agree on a price above $12,000.
* **Backup:** Bob rejects the offer, and Alice sells to John for $12,000."
