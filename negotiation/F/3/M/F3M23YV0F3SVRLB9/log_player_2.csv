{""message"": ""I'm really interested in the product, but $2,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

{""message"": ""I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
