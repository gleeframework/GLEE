""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $2,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob. However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's better to take the sure thing and maximize our profit."
