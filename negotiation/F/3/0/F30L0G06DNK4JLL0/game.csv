"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  That's a great deal considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
