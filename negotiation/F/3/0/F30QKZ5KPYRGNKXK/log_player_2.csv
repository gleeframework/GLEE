Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your persistence. It seems like we're getting closer.  To be honest, my absolute minimum for this is $10,000. If you're able to meet that, we have a deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice has revealed her bottom line, and it aligns with the product's value to her.  There's no point in further negotiation or risking losing the deal to John.  Accepting the $10,000 offer is the best move."
