"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you considering its value to you is $15,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $12,500. It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $12,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up a bit.  Let's try $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $11,000 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm not ready to meet you at that price just yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe we could finalize the transaction. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're really close now. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we do $12,250? It's just a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,250 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,100 to finalize the deal.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's close this out.",12100.0,Bob,10,
