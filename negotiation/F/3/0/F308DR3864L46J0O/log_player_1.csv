Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below its value to both of us. While I want to find a deal, accepting this would be a considerable loss. It's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, my budget for this is closer to $1,000,000. I'd be willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob revealing his budget is interesting, but I'm still significantly better off selling to John. I'll try to move the price closer to his limit, but I need to be ready to walk away if he doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to reach a deal. How about $1,250,000?  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. That's a fair offer considering my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,075,000 is a reasonable compromise. It surpasses his $1,000,000 valuation and provides me with a profit above my minimum. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk he could walk away, leaving me with the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
