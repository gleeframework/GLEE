"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, my budget for this is closer to $1,000,000. I'd be willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to reach a deal. How about $1,250,000?  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. That's a fair offer considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
