"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This offer reflects my understanding of the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree this product is valuable, the price point you've presented is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response and your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your perspective on the value, however, $700,000  falls quite short of what I can accept for this product. Considering its unique benefits and potential for your business, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer that recognizes its true value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  That said, we're still a ways off from a number that works for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working on this with me, and I understand you're looking for a competitive price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. However, I value our conversation and believe this product can be a game-changer for your business.  Let's try to find a middle ground: How about $900,000? This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my commitment to getting this deal done with you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  If you're serious about working together, I can go up to $775,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
