"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $750000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the deal.

"I understand you're close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $875000, but I'd like to propose a compromise.
