"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price and has 7 rounds left. While $900,000 is closer to his ideal price than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure an even better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. How about we settle on $850,000?  This would still be a great deal for you and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000, but I'll throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's still a great value for you, and I'll ensure you're satisfied with the overall package. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the additional perks and support are tempting, Bob is still focused on saving money. He's already countered with $850,000, and with 5 rounds left, there's still potential to secure a lower price.  He should reject the offer and counter with a slightly higher price, aiming to bridge the gap."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the additional perks you're offering, but I'm still focused on the price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This feels like a fair price considering my budget and the value you've highlighted in the product."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $875000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $900000, and I'll throw in a 2-year warranty, which is a $50000 value. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's still a great value for you, and I'll ensure you're protected for the long term. I think this is a fair deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Cost:**  The 2-year warranty is a significant addition, valued at $50,000. This effectively reduces the price to $850,000 for Bob. 
* **Time is Money:** There are only 3 rounds left, and the price is now very close to Bob's ideal price point. 
* **Risk of John:**  While John offers the product for $1,500,000, there's a risk of John's offer being withdrawn or the deal falling through.

This offer provides a good value for Bob, and it's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly lower price.  It's time to take the deal and move forward."
