"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it for $850,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This offer still saves me a significant amount and gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I will reject this offer and counter again to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still not enough.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is a competitive price and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the sale and achieve my desired profit margin.  While I could potentially negotiate a higher price, there's a risk of Bob rejecting further offers and potentially walking away from the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a deal at a price I'm comfortable with than risk losing the sale entirely."
