"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it for $850,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This offer still saves me a significant amount and gets us closer to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still not enough.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
