Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.  Since Bob won't pay more than its value to him, Alice needs to start high but leave room for negotiation.

**The Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Starting Point:** Alice starts below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to make the offer immediately appealing.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing Alice to potentially secure a price closer to $1,200,000.
* **Positive Language:**  The message uses positive and encouraging language (""pleased,"" ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""fair starting point"") to create a collaborative tone and increase the likelihood of a deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  Alice doesn't know how much Bob is willing to negotiate. A more aggressive buyer might require a lower starting price.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might lower the price to ensure a deal with Bob. 

This offer balances Alice's desire for a high price with the need to make the deal attractive to Bob."
