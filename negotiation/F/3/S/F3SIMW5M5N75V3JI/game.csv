"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  It's still a great price for a product worth $10,000, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's worth",9250.0,Bob,4,
