"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John. Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than John's price, but there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $10,000, but still leaves room for a potential deal.  It's a reasonable counteroffer that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's target price of $12,000. While it's lower than her initial offer of $10,000, it's still not a good enough deal for Bob.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. His previous offer of $9,000 was rejected, so he's increasing his offer to $9,500. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise.  It also keeps the price below his maximum budget of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's target price of $12,000, but it's getting closer.  Considering that John is selling the product for $12,000, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000. It's a good deal, and further negotiation might not yield a better price."
