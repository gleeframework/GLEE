Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start high with Bob.
* **Justification for price:**  The message hints at the product's value and the fact that you have other potential buyers. This creates a sense of scarcity and justifies the higher price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it doesn't necessarily eliminate Bob. There's room for him to counter-offer if he's truly interested.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and the product's worth to him."
