"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer. How about $9,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
