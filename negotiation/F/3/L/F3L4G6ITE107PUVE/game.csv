,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1000000 is significantly below what the product is worth. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $1150000. It's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $1100000.  This is a significant discount from my original price and represents a fair value for both of us.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1100000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1050000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment, but $1050000 is simply not enough for me to let go of this product. Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to drop to $1125000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your desire to secure it. This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure if you're serious about it being your final offer, but I'm willing to make one last push. I can go up to $1075000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider it a serious offer",1075000.0,Bob,8,
