"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  We have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $90 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  Would you consider $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counter:** We're offering $80, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This shows we're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and polite while conveying our intention to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Approach:** We're aiming to lower the price gradually, leaving room for future negotiations if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $85. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has moved from $90 to $85, showing a willingness to negotiate. This is a good price for us, considering our initial goal was to spend less than $100. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  While we could try for a lower price, we're already in round 3. Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John for a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John."
