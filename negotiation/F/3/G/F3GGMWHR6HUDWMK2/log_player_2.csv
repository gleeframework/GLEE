"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still fair. Let's chat about $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! If this doesn't work out, I have another buyer ready to go, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
