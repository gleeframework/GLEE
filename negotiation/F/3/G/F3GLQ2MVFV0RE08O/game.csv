"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your specific needs and enhance your daily life significantly. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than $120. Would you like to start by discussing a price that reflects its true value to you?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's features, but $150 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay $85 for the product. While I would love to accommodate your budget, I need to ensure that the transaction reflects the value of the product to both parties. I am proposing a counteroffer of $95, which I believe strikes a balance between the value you see in the product and the price point you're comfortable with.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a significant jump from my initial offer.  I believe this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your consideration, Bob. I understand your perspective and am glad to hear that you are willing to increase your offer to $90. To continue moving forward, I propose a counteroffer of $93. This price respects your budget while also reflecting the value of the product to you.",93.0,Alice,5,
