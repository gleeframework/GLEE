Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to the product's value to me ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, or for me to slightly reduce the price to entice him. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for my minimum price gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately sell to Bob.

**Why this strategy works:**

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. There's a chance Bob might accept the $119 price outright. If not, I can always adjust my offer slightly downwards or walk away knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John."
