"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,
