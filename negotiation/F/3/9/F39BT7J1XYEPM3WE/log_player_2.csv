"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer allows for negotiation. We're aiming for a price much lower than Alice's initial offer while staying significantly above her known value of the product. This strategy leaves room for us to potentially reach a price closer to $8,000, saving us a good amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above her value. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a price closer to $8,000. We're getting closer to our walk-away point (buying from John), so we need to be strategic in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still quite interested in the product, how about we settle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We are now getting closer to Alice's limit and our own limit.  We know Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000 so we offer her that price in attempt to get the best deal."
