"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a fair starting point considering the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and $10,000 to me. It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a good price without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted by the $10,000 offer, it's still less than what I'd ideally want.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to stick with my goal of getting closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to $10,500. There are still more rounds left, so I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500. This is a significant compromise and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I need to make a decision. While Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a very low price, I'm not confident I'll be able to get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds.  To avoid potentially losing the deal entirely, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. This is a safe option that ensures I don't lose money on the deal."
