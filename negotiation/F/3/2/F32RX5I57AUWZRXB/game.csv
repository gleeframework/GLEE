"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85?  I think that's fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
