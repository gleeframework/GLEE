"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This gives us room to negotiate, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I can still push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that's more favorable to me.  This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation, but also signals that I'm serious about getting a deal done."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet satisfied with the price.  I still believe I can get a better offer, and with 6 rounds left, I'm not desperate to sell yet. I'll counteroffer again, keeping in mind that selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm going to take a more aggressive approach this round. I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still within my acceptable range. I'm hoping this will push Bob closer to my minimum. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal, but I'm also aware that time is ticking."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet satisfied.  I still have 4 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a higher price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push Bob higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but this time I'm going to be more specific about the price. I'm hoping this will send a clear signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a deal done, but I'm not going to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low for my liking, and I'm running out of time.  While I could counteroffer again, there's a good chance he won't budge.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a profitable outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
