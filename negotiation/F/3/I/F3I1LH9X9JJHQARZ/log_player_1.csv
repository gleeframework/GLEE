Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a price of $75 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $75 is more than what John would offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll counter Bob's offer to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $85?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $80 for the product. This feels more in line with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a higher price, there's no guarantee that he would agree. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
