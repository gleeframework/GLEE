,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  It's a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $122.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $120.  This would allow us both to walk away happy.",120.0,Bob,4,
