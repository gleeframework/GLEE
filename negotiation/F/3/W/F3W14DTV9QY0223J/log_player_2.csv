"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to quickly establish a range for negotiation. This price is still within my budget and might be appealing to Alice as it's only slightly below her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. There are still multiple rounds left, so there's time to explore options before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  It's a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product while still staying within my budget. This offer is a reasonable compromise, potentially leading to a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can finalize the deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally reached my maximum budget of $10,000. While I would prefer to pay less, accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget. Additionally, if I reject this offer, I have a high chance of being forced to buy from John at the same price, without any potential for negotiation."
