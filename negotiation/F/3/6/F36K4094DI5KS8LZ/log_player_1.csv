Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $800,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to Bob's $1,000,000 value. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, emphasizing the fair value of the product while leaving room for Bob to counter. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest while ensuring I start with a price that maximizes my potential profit. I'm prepared to negotiate and potentially make counteroffers, but I also have the backup option of selling to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000, I am still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $950,000.  I believe there is room for negotiation and I'm willing to see if I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to reconsider his position.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I aim to create a sense of urgency and potentially incentivize Bob to accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to weigh the potential gains of further negotiation against the risk of losing him as a buyer and resorting to John's offer."
