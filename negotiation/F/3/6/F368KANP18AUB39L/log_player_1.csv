Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at the discounted price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, selling to Bob at a slightly lower price can still yield a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price close to your minimum ($12,000) creates a sense of urgency and value. Bob is getting a ""deal"" compared to your guaranteed sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer doesn't allow for explicit negotiation, Bob might be more inclined to accept a slightly high price knowing it's already discounted."
