Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is above your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $115 is below Bob's value of $120, giving him a potential benefit from buying. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth and potential for a higher price without immediately risking a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that's a little high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than selling to John for $100, I believe I can still do better.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
