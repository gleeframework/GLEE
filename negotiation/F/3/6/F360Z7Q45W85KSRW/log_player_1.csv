Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob anticipates.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the communication open. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a backup, ensuring she won't be pressured into accepting an offer below her minimum."
