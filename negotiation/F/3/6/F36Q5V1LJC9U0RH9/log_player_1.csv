Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your $10,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for potential counteroffers and a possible win-win scenario.

I'll keep in mind that John is a backup option, and I'll be prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial offer."
