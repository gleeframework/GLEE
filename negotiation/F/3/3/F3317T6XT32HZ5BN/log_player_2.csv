"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a very high price, and Bob should try to negotiate a better deal.  He can reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which reflects a fair price while still allowing me a reasonable profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 represents the high end of its value,  $700,000 undervalues what this product brings. How about we settle at $900,000? This recognizes your interest while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than the initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This demonstrates my genuine interest while also staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
