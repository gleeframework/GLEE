"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also considering the possibility of John as a backup option, so I don't want to waste too much time with Bob if he's not serious about paying a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum of $8,000, I still think I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise that shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but it still allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm only on round 4.  It's getting risky to continue, as I'm already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer at $9,200 is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000."
