Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $980,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.

You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $990,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $990,000.  Since you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings of $10,000 and buy from John."
