"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $980,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",980000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $990,000. That's the best I can do.",990000.0,Alice,5,
