"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you consider $750,000? I feel that would be a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
