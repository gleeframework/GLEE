"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice's offer of $115 is too high.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $110 is still slightly higher than what you ideally want to pay, but it's closer to your target price of $105.
* It's a reasonable compromise, especially since you're already in the middle of negotiations.
* Buying from John for $120 would cost you more, so accepting Alice's offer is the better choice in this scenario."
