"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $102 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $97? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, it's clear he's very reluctant to go above $100.  At this point, the small potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him walking away.  It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
