"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with a million dollars. This sets a strong initial baseline and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject it and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is still a considerable amount, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway. It also leaves room for potential further negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $850,000.  This is just a bit higher than John's offer, but still within a range where I'm comfortable negotiating.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and come closer to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially continue negotiating and try for a higher price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer secures the sale and ensures I get my minimum target."
