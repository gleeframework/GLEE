"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I've priced it fairly at $1,800,000 considering its value and potential. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While she's willing to meet halfway,  $1,500,000 is still above my maximum price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for some profit for you.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,300,000. Let's split the difference - how about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,400,000 is still above my maximum. It's worth pushing for a lower price, but we're getting close to my limit. If the next round doesn't get us closer, I might have to go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really hoping we can reach a deal.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
