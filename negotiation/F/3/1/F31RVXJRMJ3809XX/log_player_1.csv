Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for some profit for you.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really hoping we can reach a deal.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.
