Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for a substantial profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but leaves you with a considerable profit even if John becomes the buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is strong, the message's tone leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
