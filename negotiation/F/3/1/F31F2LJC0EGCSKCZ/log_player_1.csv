"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the ""great deal"" for both of us to frame it as a win-win situation, increasing Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I leave the door open for Bob to counteroffer, encouraging a back-and-forth exchange. 

**Strategy:**

I want to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By starting high and emphasizing the mutual benefit, I hope to encourage Bob to counteroffer and ultimately reach a price closer to my desired value.  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll be prepared to adjust my counteroffers strategically throughout the next rounds.  However, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 if I feel the negotiation isn't going my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay a significant amount.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be the most profitable, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm prepared to hold out for a price closer to my desired value. I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our positions. If the negotiations continue to stall, I'll keep John as a backup option, but I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which still offers great value for you.  Let's meet in the middle and seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise that brings me closer to Bob's offer while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the ""great value"" to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits of acquiring the product. 
* **Call to Action:**  The phrase ""meet in the middle"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. This tactic aims to increase Bob's chances of accepting my counteroffer, bringing us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob still rejects my offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and the remaining rounds.  I'll always keep John's offer as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $950000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob's offer is only a $30,000 increase from his previous offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a substantial enough improvement to warrant accepting.
* **Negotiation Room:** I'm confident that I can still secure a better price by continuing to negotiate.  
* **John as a Backup:** I'm aware that John is a reliable backup option, giving me confidence to hold firm in the negotiations with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is slightly lower than my previous offer but still closer to my desired value. This strategy maintains a sense of urgency for Bob while leaving room for further negotiation. If Bob continues to stall, I'll be prepared to reconsider selling to John.  However, I'm determined to see if I can reach a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see that you're serious about getting this product. Let's meet halfway again.  I'm willing to lower my price to $935,000. This offer represents a significant value for you, and it's the closest I can come without sacrificing too much. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer represents a further compromise, bridging the gap between our current positions.  
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm highlighting the ""significant value"" for Bob to encourage him to view this offer as a good deal.
* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this is a final compromise and that I'm not willing to go lower.

**Strategy:**

* **Urgency:**  By suggesting this is my ""final"" offer, I'm adding pressure to the negotiation. 
* **Minimizing Losses:** I'm aiming to get as close to my target price as possible before considering selling to John. 
* **Assessing Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this offer to decide my next move. If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $915000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob's offer is only $15,000 more than his previous one, a very small step forward.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks reaching a stalemate with only a few rounds left. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be significantly more profitable, but I'm still not giving up on a potentially better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price slightly higher than his last offer. This will show him that I'm still willing to negotiate but also demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell.  If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still firm on the value of this product. My final offer is $925,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. This is my last compromise, so let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, adding pressure to the negotiation and showing that I'm prepared to walk away.
* **Fairness:**  I'm presenting the offer as fair and a ""great deal,"" reminding Bob of the value of the product and the potential benefits he'll receive.
* **Urgency:** The statement ""let's close this deal"" is intended to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept my offer by emphasizing its finality.
* **Risk/Reward:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John, accepting a larger profit but potentially missing out on a deal that might be better for me in the long run.
* **Last Chance:**  This counteroffer is a last-ditch effort to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $910000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We're in the eighth round, leaving only two rounds left.  The chances of getting a better deal from Bob in such a limited time are slim.
* **Small Increment:**  Bob's offer is only a $10,000 increase from his previous one, demonstrating his unwillingness to budge significantly. 
* **Significant Profit:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 guarantees a large profit, making it a more attractive option than risking further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

While I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal, I'm acknowledging the reality of the situation.  The time pressure and Bob's reluctance to increase his offer significantly make John's offer the safest and most profitable option at this point.  I'm prioritizing financial security and a guaranteed profit over the possibility of a more favorable deal with Bob."
