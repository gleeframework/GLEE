Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you meet me at this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my goal, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go lower than $1,050,000.

Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price of $800,000. It's better to secure the sale with John and guarantee a profit than to risk further negotiations with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
