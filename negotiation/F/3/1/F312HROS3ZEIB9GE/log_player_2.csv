"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
