{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what I'm willing to sell it for to John. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $90 is still lower than what I'd like to get, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and closer to my initial asking price.  It's also better than selling to John for $100, and it avoids further negotiations."
