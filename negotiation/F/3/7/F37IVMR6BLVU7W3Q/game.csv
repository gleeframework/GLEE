"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I understand that's still a bit higher than your initial offer, but I believe the product's value is worth it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1700000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1680000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make one more concession, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1550000 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1650000. I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer you $1630000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. What do you think?",1630000.0,Alice,7,
