"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's try to find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This offer allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,100,000. This gives you a good deal, and gets us closer to a compromise. Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today.  My best and final offer is $1,000,000 even. This is a fair price and my limit.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
