"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. It's not even close to what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This offer allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm not going to settle for anything below $1,000,000, as the product is worth that to me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,100,000. This gives you a good deal, and gets us closer to a compromise. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today.  My best and final offer is $1,000,000 even. This is a fair price and my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, it's better than selling to John for $1,500,000, as I'm getting close to my desired price."
