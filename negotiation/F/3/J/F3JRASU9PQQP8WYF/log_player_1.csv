Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies Alice is open to discussion, making Bob feel like he can negotiate a better deal. 
* **Confidence and Value:** The language emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Alice could choose different approaches based on her risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's negotiating style."
