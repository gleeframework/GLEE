Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good profit.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to negotiate. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I mention that the product is perfect for Bob, reminding him of its worth to him. 

This approach balances a desire for a high price with a willingness to negotiate and a friendly demeanor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $90?  I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $90 is a good price. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's likely that Bob won't go any higher. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could try to get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing me to sell to John for less. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time, and I might not get a better offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision in this scenario. It maximizes my profit while minimizing the risk of getting a lower price or losing the deal altogether."
