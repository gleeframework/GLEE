"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $90?  I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 90}
