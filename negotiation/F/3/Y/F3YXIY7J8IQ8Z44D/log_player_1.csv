I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get more than my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my original price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering at $14,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit."
