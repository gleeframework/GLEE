The product is too expensive at $2,000,000. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, and hopefully, it will encourage her to negotiate. I'm willing to go higher if necessary, but I want to see how she responds first."

I'm going to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest proposal. I hope this will show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm determined to get a good price."
