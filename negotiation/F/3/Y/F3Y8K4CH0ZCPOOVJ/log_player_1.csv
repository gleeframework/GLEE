Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $122.50?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $118? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $118 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're getting closer.  $118 is a good offer, but how about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $120 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider $116? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although I'd prefer to get closer to $120, Bob is getting closer to my minimum price point.  I'm going to accept his offer, as I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
