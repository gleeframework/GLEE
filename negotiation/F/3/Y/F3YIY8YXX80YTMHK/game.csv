"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $13500? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet you at $13500. I would like to stick to my maximum budget of $12000. I hope we can reach an agreement close to this amount.",12000.0,Bob,4,
