Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $14,000, Bob still gets a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This gives you some room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher offer might make Bob instantly reject, making negotiation harder.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible while still securing a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum value.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $15,000, so it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $13,500? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for his bottom price.
* **Lower than your previous offer:**  It demonstrates flexibility and makes you seem more reasonable. 
* **Still above your minimum:**  You're still earning more than your minimum acceptable amount. 

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet you at $13500. I would like to stick to my maximum budget of $12000. I hope we can reach an agreement close to this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is sticking to his $12,000 offer, and while it's tempting to keep negotiating, you've already made a counteroffer and are close to your minimum. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  

Remember, your goal is to maximize your earnings, and selling to John ensures you get the best possible price for your product."
