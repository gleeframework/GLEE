"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer, so if you're interested, please let me know as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Saving money:** Buying from Alice at $100 is cheaper than John's $120 price, saving Bob $20.
* **Value:**  While Bob values the product at $120, getting it for $100 is a good deal."
