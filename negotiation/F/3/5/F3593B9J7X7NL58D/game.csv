"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000, as I mentioned before, but I'm willing to throw in an additional service that I think is worth $250 to you. So, I'm offering $9,000 for the product and an additional $250 in services. That's a total of $9,250, which is the same as your last offer, but I'm providing more value to you.",9000.0,Bob,6,
