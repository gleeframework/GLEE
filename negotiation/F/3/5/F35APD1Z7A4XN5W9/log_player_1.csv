Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer allows me to potentially earn more than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($80), but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is not willing to pay $100.  It's a good starting point to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($80), and it's better than selling to John.  Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoid further negotiation."
