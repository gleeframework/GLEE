"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable for a price of $140. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer of $140 is the best move. Here's why:

* **Saves you money:** You save $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Within your budget:** $140 is under your $150 limit. 
 
There's no guarantee Alice would go any lower, and risking a rejection means you'd have to settle for the more expensive option with John."
