"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation to see if I can get him to come up to my desired price point.  If he doesn't accept, I'll see what his counteroffer is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take $9,000, it's not worth it considering my floor is $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000, which is still above my minimum threshold, but hopefully more appealing to Bob than my initial offer.  This gives him a chance to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for anything lower than $12,000.  I'll keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm further lowering my price to $10,500. This is getting closer to Bob's valuation, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, this shows him I'm serious about selling the product and that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is now at his valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with him to see if I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $11,000. I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to go above his valuation. If he's willing to budge, I might be able to get closer to my desired price."
