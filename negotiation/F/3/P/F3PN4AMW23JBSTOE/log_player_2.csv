"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  You can try to get a lower price by counteroffering. You have 10 rounds to work with, so it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your estimated value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to your desired price, you still have room to negotiate.  You're willing to pay more than $10,000, so there's potential to find a price between $10,000 and $11,500 that works for both of you.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering we're both trying to find a price that works for us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession. I'm offering it to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price. You're willing to pay up to $11,000, and her offer is $11,250. While it's not the ideal price, it's within your budget and a reasonable compromise.  You're also nearing the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, so it's beneficial to close the deal rather than risk losing the opportunity to John or further negotiations."
