"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal before committing.  Since you don't know Alice's minimum price, there's a chance you can get the product for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my desire for a good deal and leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a price point that's attractive to Alice while still being within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above my ideal price point. I believe I can still push for a lower price and potentially secure a deal closer to my initial counteroffer. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a good deal.  This counteroffer represents a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. I'm hoping to find a price that's acceptable to both parties."
