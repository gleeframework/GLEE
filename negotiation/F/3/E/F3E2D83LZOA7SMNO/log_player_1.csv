"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point, considering my minimum is $10,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for the lowest possible price just yet. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and potentially earn more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for potential profit. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining some value for myself. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $11,000, which is only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer.  It's getting close to my minimum, and I have a feeling he won't budge much further.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
