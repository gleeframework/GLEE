"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $125. Can we meet in the middle?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  Let's split the difference. How about $132.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $122.50. Can we meet in the middle again?",122.5,Bob,6,
