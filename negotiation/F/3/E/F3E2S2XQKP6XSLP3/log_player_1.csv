"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $800,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000.  It sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,050,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, even though John is a guaranteed sale at that price.  I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate with Bob, I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and my budget. Let's try to find a compromise here.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've been trying to negotiate with Bob for a few rounds now, and he's only willing to go up to $925,000.  This is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John.  It's not ideal, but it's the best outcome I can guarantee at this point."
