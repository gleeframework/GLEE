{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is less than what you're willing to pay, it's still a significant amount above what the product is worth to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. You should reject the initial offer and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}

```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is still too high. It's time to make a counteroffer closer to the midpoint between your target price ($120) and Alice's perceived value ($80). This offer is a compromise that shows you're serious about buying, but still trying to get a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your acceptable price range, but you're still looking to save more. This offer is a slight increase from your previous counteroffer, demonstrating you're willing to compromise while still keeping the price under $100. It also leaves a little room for Alice to negotiate if she feels the price is too low."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your acceptable price range, but you're starting to run out of time. However, you're still hoping to get a better deal. You'll reject this offer and attempt one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your last chance to negotiate with Alice.  You're pushing the price towards your target price of $100, but giving Alice a slight margin to potentially agree. It's a risky move, but with only two rounds left, you're hoping to avoid buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You're running out of time and with only one round left, it's likely that Alice will not budge any further. It's better to accept the price from John at $120 than risk getting a higher price from Alice in the last round."
