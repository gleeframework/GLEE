"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,750 is still a little below what I need.  Would you consider $11,000?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",11000.0,Alice,5,
