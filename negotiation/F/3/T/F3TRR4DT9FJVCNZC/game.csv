"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",10500.0,Bob,4,
