"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer for $105 is still a good deal. It's higher than selling to John and leaves only a few rounds left. There's a chance Bob might not offer anything higher in the remaining rounds, so I'll take the sure profit."
