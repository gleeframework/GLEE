"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $90?  It's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!",88.5,Alice,5,
