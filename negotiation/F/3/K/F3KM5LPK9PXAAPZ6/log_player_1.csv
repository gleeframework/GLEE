"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175,  slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price than selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $160 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $150 and allows me to close the deal quickly. I'd rather not risk further negotiations and potentially lose the sale to John."
