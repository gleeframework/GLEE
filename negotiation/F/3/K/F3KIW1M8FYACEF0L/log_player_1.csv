Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is way too high for me.  If this product is still available for something closer to $700,000, let me know.  Otherwise, I need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you've proposed. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that is still much higher than I can go.  If you are willing to consider $800,000, let me know.  That is my final offer; otherwise, I need to move on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute limit. While this is more than half his initial offer, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. There's no point in further negotiation with Bob. Accepting John's offer ensures the best possible outcome for me in this scenario."
