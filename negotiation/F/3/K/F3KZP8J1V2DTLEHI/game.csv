"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I think you're a serious buyer. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $1500000 and $2000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1750000. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still above what I can reasonably spend.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000, which is a fair price given my budget.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1750000. I'll offer the product to you for $1375000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,5,
