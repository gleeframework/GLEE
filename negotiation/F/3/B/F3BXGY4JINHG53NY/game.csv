"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15000 is a fair price, I'd be willing to come down a little to $17500. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while recognizing your budget constraints. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end?",16000.0,Bob,4,
