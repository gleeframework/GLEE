"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us. This reflects the product's value to you, while ensuring I don't lose too much on the transaction. Let's find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
