I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This is a fair price, considering your own valuation of the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1100000, which is closer to my valuation of the product and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
