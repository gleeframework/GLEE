Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but it offers a potential win-win.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision sooner. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for further discussion and potentially reaching a price closer to $1,200,000."
