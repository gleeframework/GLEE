{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation, knowing he's likely to counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially securing a higher price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,200. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Even though it's slightly less than my ideal price, it's worth accepting as it's a good deal and avoids further negotiation or the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
