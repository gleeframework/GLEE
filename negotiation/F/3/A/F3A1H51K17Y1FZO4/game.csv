"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That's still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,250, which would be $9,875. Can you consider this offer?",9875.0,Bob,4,
