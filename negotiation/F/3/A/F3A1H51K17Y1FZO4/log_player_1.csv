Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum than John's offer, I think I can still get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,250, which would be $9,875. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me and higher than selling to John. I'm happy to close the deal."
