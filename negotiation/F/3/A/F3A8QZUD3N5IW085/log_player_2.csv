"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's closer to my maximum budget than her minimum selling price. I need to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is significantly below my maximum budget, but it gives me room to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While closer to a reasonable price, $12,500 is still too high. Alice is willing to negotiate down from her initial offer, so I'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me.  How about we settle at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly below her current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while leaving room for further adjustments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12,200. I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly motivated to sell but is still trying to stay above her minimum. I'll push a little further since we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are getting close. What if we split the difference and say $11,600?  That seems like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 11600
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Alice halfway between our last offers. This shows a willingness to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price while still aiming for a significant discount."
