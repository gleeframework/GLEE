Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a strong starting point that reflects the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly what I offered in the first round. It's a good deal for me and ensures I get the most out of the negotiation in these early rounds."
