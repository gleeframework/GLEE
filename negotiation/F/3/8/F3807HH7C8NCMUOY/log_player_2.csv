"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $14,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $15,000 at a slightly discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's target price of $15,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value and condition of the product, I propose a price of $14,250. This is higher than your offer but still offers some savings compared to the original price. I hope this meets your expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to spend as little as possible, and while Alice's counteroffer is closer to his target, it's still above his desired price. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach an even lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and your previous offers, I propose a final price of $14,200. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $14,200 is very close to Bob's desired price of $14,100.  While Bob could potentially keep negotiating, it's likely that Alice will be firm on this price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's price, and only $100 more than his ideal price."
