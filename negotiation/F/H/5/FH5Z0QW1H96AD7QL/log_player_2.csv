# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. Would you like to buy it from me for $12000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  You have some room to bargain before having to resort to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still $1,000 over your desired price, and since you have John as a backup, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance you might be able to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I'm closer to my budget, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,500.  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're making a serious effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11200, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,200 is only $800 lower than John's price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation when you have a guaranteed alternative.  You can get the product from John for a price that's only slightly higher, and you'll avoid the potential for Alice to counteroffer with an even higher price."
