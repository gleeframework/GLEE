"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings to the table is substantial.  I could consider coming down to $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable at this point.  How about $1,100,000? I believe this reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
