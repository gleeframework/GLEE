"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product. Given its high value and quality, we believe it is worth $12000. We are offering you this exceptional opportunity at a special introductory price of $11000. We understand the importance of value for money and trust this offer reflects our commitment to providing you with the best possible deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000**. 
* **You have room to negotiate**.  You know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so you can likely get a better price.
* **It's risky to buy from John immediately**.  While he's your fallback option, you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to engage in negotiations. In light of your offer, we would like to extend a counteroffer of $10800 for the product. This price reflects our commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution while maintaining the value of our product. We hope this proposal aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget of $12,000.**
* **You've already moved closer to your desired price.** You started at $12,000 and are now at $10,800.
* **It's unlikely you'll get a much better price with further negotiation.** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also demonstrating that the product has value for her.

**It's a good deal for you, and it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of going to John and potentially losing the opportunity entirely.**"
