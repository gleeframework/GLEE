"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $11,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $13,500. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you considering you're willing to sell it to John for $12,000.  Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $12,500. I'll meet you at $13,000, which is still a bit above the $12,000 I could get from John, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can shake on it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
