Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and features,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to share his thoughts, making it clear that Alice is open to discussing the price.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit but acknowledges the risk that Bob might reject the offer.  Alice has a fallback option with John, ensuring she won't be forced to sell below her minimum."
