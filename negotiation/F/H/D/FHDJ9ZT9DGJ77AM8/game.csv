"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This price reflects the true value of this product and its potential for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
