"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he values the product highly enough to engage in further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, it's worth exploring if I can get more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than his initial offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $16,000, which is closer to my desired price. It's worth accepting this offer, as I risk losing more value by continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's offer of $15,000."
