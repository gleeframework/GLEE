"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $160? It's a great price for a product like this, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price that's still a good profit for me, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",145.0,Alice,7,
