"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a great compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. It's a small compromise, but I think it's fair considering the value of the product.",107.5,Alice,5,
