``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate and leaves space for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Positive Framing:** My message focuses on the benefits and value of the product, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** I end the message by inviting Bob to discuss the offer, showing that I'm open to negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $12,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, it's still significantly less than my desired outcome. I believe I can do better by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I can leverage this. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I value my product.
* **Next Steps:**  I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer that's more appealing to me while still showing some flexibility."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and benefits. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
