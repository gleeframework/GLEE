"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and benefits. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet at $14,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
