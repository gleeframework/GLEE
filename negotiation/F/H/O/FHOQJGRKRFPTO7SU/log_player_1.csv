I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value while leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm confident that I can still make a decent profit even if I need to lower the price slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I can sell to John for $10,000, I'm willing to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm countering with $12,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price than John's offer. Accepting his $11,000 offer secures a better profit than selling to John immediately."
