Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is $6,000 more than Bob values the product at, giving him a good deal. It's also $1,000 less than John's offer, so I still make a good profit. This strategy maximizes my chances of closing the deal with Bob while ensuring a profitable outcome even if he rejects the offer."
