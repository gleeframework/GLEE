Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This leaves a good amount of profit for me while still being attractive to Bob, considering the product is worth $120 to him. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me, considering my minimum is $80. Accepting this offer maximizes my profits at this point."
