"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum value.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for us both to make a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000. Considering the value I place on the product is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to make a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise given our previous offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $9,500. Considering the value I place on the product is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.
