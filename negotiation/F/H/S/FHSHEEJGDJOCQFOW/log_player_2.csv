# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000. Considering the value I place on the product is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to make a deal. What do you think?
