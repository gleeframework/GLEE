"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount for Bob, but still allows me to earn a good profit. I'll see how he reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it still allows me to make a decent profit. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Although $82 is barely above my minimum, it's still better than selling to John for $80. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation rounds."
