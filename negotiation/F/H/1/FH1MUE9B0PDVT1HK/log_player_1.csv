Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
