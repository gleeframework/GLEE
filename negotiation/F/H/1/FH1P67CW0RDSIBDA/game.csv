"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, it's significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that work for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,100,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
