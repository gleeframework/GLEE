"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" qualities, ""immense value,"" and ""potential,"" aiming to justify the high initial price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This strong opening stance positions me favorably for the subsequent negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I am interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my own valuation and the opportunity it represents. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from his side. Accepting would mean a significant loss for me. While selling to John is an option, I still have rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial pricing reflects the unique nature and potential of this product which goes beyond standard valuations.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Holding Ground:** While I'm significantly lowering my asking price, I'm still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This signals  willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Strategic Concession:** This large price drop aims to prompt a counteroffer from Bob that's meaningfully higher than his initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price given the value I place on the product and my ability to invest in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. While selling to John is becoming a more appealing option, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob in the remaining rounds. His latest offer suggests he's willing to move further up from his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  While your offer is closer to what I envision, the value this product represents, with its future potential, necessitates a price that reflects its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This represents a significant investment on my part to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I want to encourage Bob's engagement as he is steadily increasing his offers. 
* **Shifting Focus:** The message subtly shifts the focus from simply ""budget"" to the product's inherent value and future potential.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is a calculated risk. It's a firm stance above my absolute minimum but leaves space for a final counteroffer from Bob while keeping the John option open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I recognize the potential of this product, $1,650,000 is still above my maximum limit.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to invest in its future. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** While Bob is making upward movements, his increases are incremental and he is still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Limited Upside:** With only four rounds remaining, the likelihood of Bob bridging the gap to a price I find acceptable is low. Continuing the negotiation poses a risk of ending up with a less favorable outcome. 
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price, eliminating the risk of ending up with a lower offer from Bob after further negotiation."
