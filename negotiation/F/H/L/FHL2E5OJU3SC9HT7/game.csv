"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $170. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $168. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",168.0,Alice,5,
