Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my potential earnings.  I'm aware that Bob might reject this, so I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm adjusting my price down to $15,000, which is still a fair amount above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that encourages him to accept while still leaving room for me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I don't see any further room for negotiation. John is willing to pay the same amount, so I'll take the sure thing and sell to him."
