"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

This is a good price for the product and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better deal."
