{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
