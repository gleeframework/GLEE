"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can potentially get a better deal. You are willing to pay up to $150, and the product is worth $80 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both parties.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to start the counter-offering process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal for you.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and you've already established that Alice is willing to sell for less than $120.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying more to John.  Accepting this offer ensures you get a good deal while minimizing risk."
