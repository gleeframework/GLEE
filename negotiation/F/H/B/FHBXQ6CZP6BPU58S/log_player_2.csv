"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,350,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value of $1,000,000, meaning there's room for negotiation. There's also a chance to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given your value for the product, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you a significant return on investment at a higher price point. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept the offer. $1,250,000 is a good price considering Bob's value of $1,500,000 and Alice's value of $1,000,000. Further negotiation might get a lower price, but it risks Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price."
