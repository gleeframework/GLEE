Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's more than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate but not to that extent. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $12,000.  This is still a good deal for me, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  John offers a much better deal, so I'm going to sell to him."
