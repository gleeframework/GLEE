"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its unique features and the value it can bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. While it is closer to my desired price, I'm comfortable buying from John for $10,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
