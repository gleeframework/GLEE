Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point, allowing for potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm hoping Bob finds the product valuable enough to pay this price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130 as a compromise. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If it doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

This is my final offer. It's a small compromise from my previous counteroffer, but I'm confident that it's a fair price. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get more than $120, I'm not willing to keep going back and forth with Bob.  I've made a number of concessions and it's clear that we aren't going to reach an agreement.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and saves me more time and effort."
