After careful consideration, I am extending a special offer to purchase this product at a price of $1,350,000. This amount reflects not only the intrinsic value of the product but also the unique benefits it offers to someone like yourself who can fully appreciate its potential. I trust that this proposal will be favorable to you, allowing us to collaborate on a mutually beneficial transaction. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum price and what John is offering. You can save $150,000 by going with John."
