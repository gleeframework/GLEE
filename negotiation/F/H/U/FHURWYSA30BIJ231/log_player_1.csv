"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build a friendly rapport by expressing confidence in the product's value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell the product for less than $100. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $85. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my target price, and there are still a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $85, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference at $87.50? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85, but I'm not going any higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire and Bob is still stubbornly sticking to his $85 offer. While it's tempting to keep negotiating,  I'm running out of time and the risk of getting stuck with a lower price isn't worth it. I'm going to sell to John for $120. It's a guaranteed deal and a better outcome than accepting Bob's final offer."
