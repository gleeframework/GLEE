Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in a discussion, potentially leading to a price higher than $10,000.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""unique value and features"" aims to justify the higher price point and potentially sway Bob's perception of the product's worth.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to find a price within Bob's acceptable range ($8,000 - unknown upper limit) while maximizing your profit. Starting high allows you to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will indicate how much he values the product and his willingness to negotiate.
2. **Potentially Secure a Higher Profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial offer or negotiates down to a price above $10,000, you earn more than selling to John.
3. **Maintain a Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John at your minimum price."
