Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while remaining within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's value."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000, a substantial increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting $950,000 now avoids further negotiation and potential price drops, securing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the more profitable choice."
