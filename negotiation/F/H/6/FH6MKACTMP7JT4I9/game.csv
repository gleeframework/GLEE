"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while remaining within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000, a substantial increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
