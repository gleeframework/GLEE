Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite far from what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we possibly make it $100? That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to go above $100.  Selling to John ensures we get our minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in further negotiation with Bob."
