Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's perceived value ($100) to try to maximize my profit. However, I'm keeping the offer reasonable, hoping to encourage him to negotiate further.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $120 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum threshold of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to secure a price closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a price that's still below my initial offer but closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. It's also a price that Bob might be willing to accept, given that he initially offered $80."
