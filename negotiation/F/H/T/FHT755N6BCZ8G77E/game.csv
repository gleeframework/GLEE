"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. To make this work, I could consider $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,4,
