**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob is consistently coming up in price, and we're now at $1,850,000.  This is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,500,000). It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiations stalling or Bob significantly lowering his offer in later rounds."
