"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is selling it for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. I'll buy from John and save time and effort."
