Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob's higher valuation allows for a significant profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a $100,000 gain if he accepts, a strong incentive for him. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The mention of ""other interested parties"" subtly reminds Bob that he's not the only potential buyer, adding a touch of urgency without being overly aggressive."
