"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000?  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to counteroffer at $8,750. I hope this helps us reach a fair agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $8,750 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow me to make a profit without sacrificing too much. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
