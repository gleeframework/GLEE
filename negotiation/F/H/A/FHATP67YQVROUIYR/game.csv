"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",11500.0,Alice,5,
