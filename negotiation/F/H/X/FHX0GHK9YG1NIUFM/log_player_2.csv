{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90, which is below my maximum budget of $100 and leaves some room for negotiation. This is a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. While John is selling for $100, I want to see if I can get the product from Alice for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. It's still below my maximum budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
