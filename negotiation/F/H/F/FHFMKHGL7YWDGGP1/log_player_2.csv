"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it offers and presents a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still significantly more than what John is offering. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to settle for a higher price."
