Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13,000, which is my lowest price for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000, and she's stated it's her final offer.  It's not worth risking missing out on John's $8,000 offer in the hopes of getting Alice down a little further."
