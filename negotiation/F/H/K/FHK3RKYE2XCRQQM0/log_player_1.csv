"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm going to start high, aiming for a significant profit.  I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation while still securing a good price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a lower price but still aim for a profit. I have 8 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation."

I'm reducing my asking price to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob."
