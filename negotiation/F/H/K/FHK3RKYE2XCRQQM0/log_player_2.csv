I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range where I'm willing to buy the product. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come down in price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get a better price, but I'm also aware that I can always buy from John for $1,500,000 if I need to."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
