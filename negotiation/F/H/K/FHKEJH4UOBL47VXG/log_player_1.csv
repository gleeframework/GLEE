{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000.  It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **""Amazing product"":**  This is a vague statement meant to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about the product's value.
* **Open-ended question:**  The question encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and allows me to gauge his initial interest level. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **No information about Bob's valuation:** I'm going in blind, so I need to be prepared to adjust my offer based on his responses.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to walk away from deals that don't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I think this product is great, $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable value, but I'm not going to settle for the bare minimum just yet. Here's why:

* **Negotiation room:**  I still have some room to push for a higher price. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate.
* **John's offer:** I have the security of John's $15,000 offer. This allows me to take a calculated risk and see if I can get more from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer.  I want to see if I can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to recoup some of my initial investment. I'd be willing to let the product go for $17,500. This is a fair price considering the value it offers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** My counter-offer of $17,500 is halfway between my initial offer ($20,000) and Bob's offer ($15,000).
* **Reasoning:**  I've provided a rationale for my counter-offer, emphasizing the value of the product and the need to recover some investment.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiation.  I want to know how flexible Bob is on his price.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer aims to find a compromise while keeping the negotiation moving forward. It's a balancing act: I want to get as close to my desired price as possible while also keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to recoup your investment, but $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $16000, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to my desired outcome.  Here's why accepting is the best decision:

* **Value:**  $16,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation progress:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise and move towards my price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high. John's offer is a safety net, but it's not ideal.

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Bob's offer of $16,000 represents a good balance of securing a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
