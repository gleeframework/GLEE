Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a slight window for Bob to counter-offer while still staying above Alice's minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly."
