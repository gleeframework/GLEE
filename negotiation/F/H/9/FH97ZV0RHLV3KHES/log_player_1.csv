I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but still represents a good profit for me.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and sell the product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I believe this is a good compromise and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
