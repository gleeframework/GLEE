"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  This shows Bob the product is valuable to you and that you're not desperate to sell.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a reason to accept your offer.
* **It's a reasonable first offer:**  Starting with an overly aggressive price might make Bob walk away.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob. By rejecting this offer, I can try to push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still staying above Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while maintaining my desire for a higher price. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit low. I'm willing to keep pushing for a better deal, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200} 
```

I'm going to stick with a gradual approach, raising my price slightly from the previous round.  At this point, we're getting closer to a potential deal. Bob is likely realizing the value of the product, and I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the farm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price and a better deal than selling to John. It's time to close this deal!"
