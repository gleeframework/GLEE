Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $100. I'll counter with a price closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I can come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. How about $85? I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is getting closer to my goal, it's still lower than my minimum of $100. I'll counter with a price closer to my goal in the next round.  There's still time to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for less than I'm worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I can do $87, and that's as low as I can go. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $87 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $100.  I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my goal in the next round. I have a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can close the deal for a price that's more fair to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? This feels fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $87. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $89. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum. I'm not going to risk getting stuck with a price I'm unhappy with.  I'll sell to John for $100.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than settling for less than I deserve."
