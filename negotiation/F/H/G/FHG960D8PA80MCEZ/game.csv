"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I can come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. How about $85? I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I can do $87, and that's as low as I can go. Can you accept that?",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? This feels fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.",88.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $87. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $89. Can you consider that?",89.0,Bob,8,
