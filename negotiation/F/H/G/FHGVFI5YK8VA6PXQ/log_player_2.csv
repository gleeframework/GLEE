Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. $1,050,000 is still too high. He can get the product from John for a lower price, so there's no reason to accept a deal that's more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,050,000 is still above my maximum. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. Let's try to find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. But I have to say, I'm starting to get a little impatient... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While Alice is coming down on price, it's still too high. He can get the product from John for a much lower price, so there's no reason to accept a deal that's more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your impatience, but $925,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that I believe is beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure if we're going to get any closer, Bob. But I'm willing to make one last push. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. The negotiations with Alice are getting close to his budget, but John is offering a significantly lower price. With only 3 rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate a better price with Alice. It's better to secure the product from John and save money."
