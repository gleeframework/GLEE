Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values it at $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($80).
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $119 might seem too greedy and could make Bob less likely to accept, even though it's below his perceived value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal."
