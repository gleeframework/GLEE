"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000? That feels like a fairer starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is too far off. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price. Let's try $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. Would you consider $875,000? That feels like a good compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I appreciate Bob's attempt at a compromise, $875,000 is still too far below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $875,000 is closer, I still need to maintain a certain value for this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $912,500. This price is fair for both of us and keeps the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $912,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I've also been exploring other options, and I could get a similar product for around $1,000,000. I'd much rather work with you, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Would you be willing to consider $890,000? That would make a big difference for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $890,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm not willing to settle for less. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about we settle on $900,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. It's a good deal for you, and it helps me get closer to my target.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
