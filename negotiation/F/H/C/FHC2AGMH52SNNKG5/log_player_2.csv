"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high. There's plenty of room for negotiation. It's too early to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000? That feels like a fairer starting point."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message maintains a positive tone while clearly stating the counter-offer is too high.
* **Early Rounds Strategy:** In early rounds, bolder offers can help speed up the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price. Let's try $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, which suggests she's willing to bargain. There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer. 
* **Aim Lower:**  Aiming for a price closer to $900,000 or even a bit lower is still reasonable at this stage. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting this offer shows Alice that you're serious about getting a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. Would you consider $875,000? That feels like a good compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** This counter-offer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($950,000) and our previous counter-offer ($800,000). It shows willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a Steady Pace:**  We're still moving towards a more agreeable price, but not rushing the negotiation.
* **Test the Waters:**  This offer will help gauge how much lower Alice is truly willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $875,000 is closer, I still need to maintain a certain value for this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $912,500. This price is fair for both of us and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down:** Alice is clearly trying to slow down the negotiation by only making small concessions.
* **Close to John's Price:** At $912,500, we're getting very close to John's offer of $1,000,000. It's time to increase the pressure on Alice.
* **Leverage John:** By hinting at John's offer in the next round, we might be able to secure a more significant price drop from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $912,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I've also been exploring other options, and I could get a similar product for around $1,000,000. I'd much rather work with you, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Would you be willing to consider $890,000? That would make a big difference for me."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Competition:**  We're subtly bringing John into the picture without revealing the exact price. This creates a sense of urgency for Alice.
* **Slight Concession:** The counter-offer of $890,000 is a smaller concession than before, signaling that we're nearing our limit.
* **Emphasis on Preference for Alice:** We reiterate our desire to work with Alice, but firmly stating the need for a price that aligns with our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about we settle on $900,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. It's a good deal for you, and it helps me get closer to my target.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $900,000 is a solid price for the product, saving us $100,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Time Pressure:** We are getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. While we could push for a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice not budging is significant.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice has explicitly stated she is willing to ""meet halfway"", indicating this is likely her best offer."
