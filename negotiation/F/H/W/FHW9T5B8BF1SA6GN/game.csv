"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately far below what I need to consider.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  My counteroffer is $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which is $975,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  My counteroffer is $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
