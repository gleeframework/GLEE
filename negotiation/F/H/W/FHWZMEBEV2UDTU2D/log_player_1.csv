Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price than what John is offering, so I'm not going to sell to him right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to come closer to my desired price."
