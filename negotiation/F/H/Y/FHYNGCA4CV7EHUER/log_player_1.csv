"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a tough spot. Bob offering $120 means he's very close to his maximum value. There's little room for him to go higher. 

Let's analyze the options:

* **Accepting Bob's offer** means a small profit ($120 - your minimum of $120 = $0 profit).
* **Rejecting and countering** risks Bob walking away, as he's already at a high price for him.  
* **Selling to John** guarantees the minimum profit but no chance of getting more.

Since there's a real risk of losing Bob if we push further, and John is a guaranteed sale, the safest option is to go with John.
