"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a rare opportunity to acquire this product. Knowing its value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I propose an initial offer of $1,500,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation higher, leaving room for concessions while still potentially securing a price well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and exclusivity, you're creating a narrative that supports a premium price.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and gives you information for your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:** There's still room for negotiation. You have eight rounds remaining, and by immediately accepting, you'd be leaving a lot of potential profit on the table.
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of knowing John will purchase the product for your minimum, so there's less risk in continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your initial offer falls significantly short of the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** Starting with a note of appreciation keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Firm but Fair:**  While you're making a significant concession from your initial offer, you're still holding firm well above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob why a higher price is justified.
* **Encouraging Movement:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to make a more substantial move upward in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the product's value, but I still aim to keep my expenses in check. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above your minimum acceptable price, securing you a $100,000 profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has significantly increased his offer from $800,000, demonstrating a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small increase in profit has risks.  Each round brings uncertainty, and you could end up with a worse offer or missing out on a sale altogether. 
* **Bird in Hand:**  The adage ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" applies here. Accepting a good offer now is often wiser than risking it for a slightly better one later."
