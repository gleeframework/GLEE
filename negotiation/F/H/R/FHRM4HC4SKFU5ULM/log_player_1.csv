Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its value. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a high anchor. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offered price of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer. This knowledge allows you to be more confident in your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Negotiation is dynamic, and Bob's response might influence your next move."
