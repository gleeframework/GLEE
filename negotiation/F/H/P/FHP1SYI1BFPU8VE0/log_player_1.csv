Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $100, so this price gives him room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This price is still above your minimum value of $150, so you'll still make a profit.
* **It's a strong opening:** A strong opening price helps you establish a negotiation range. 

By starting high, you can potentially secure a higher price for the product, while still giving Bob some leeway to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $120 is quite a bit lower than what I need to get.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I'm still aiming to keep my spending within my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to your minimum, it's still below the $150 you can get from John.  There's no guarantee Bob will budge further, and it's not worth risking losing a sure $150 for the potential of getting $130."
