Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Your Minimum:** Offering the product between $100 (Bob's value) and $120 (your minimum) creates a potential win-win. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below $120.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

By starting at $119, there's room for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he wants to, while still ensuring you make a good profit."
