Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I'll reject it and counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
