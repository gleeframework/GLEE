"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,500,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the worth of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob can potentially secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's still in a good position as he has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant amount for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
