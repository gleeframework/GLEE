"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,500,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the worth of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant amount for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
