"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's fair for both parties. Offering $1,100,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still higher than her minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers or that the negotiation will drag on, potentially leading to a worse outcome. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price, saving Bob money compared to buying from John."
