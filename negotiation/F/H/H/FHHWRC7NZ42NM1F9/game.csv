"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, and I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll meet you at $1,025,000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
