**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $12,000, there is no immediate benefit to accepting.  I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,375, which is very close to my last offer of $11,250.  While I could continue to negotiate, there is a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer or that I might run out of rounds. Accepting this offer will save me $625 compared to buying from John.  Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this offer."
