,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  How about we split the difference at $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $92.50 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already gone a long way to meet you halfway, and I think I can do a bit better. How about we try $97? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",97.0,Alice,5,
