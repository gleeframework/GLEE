"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775000. I can offer it to you for $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with this price, I have another interested party who is willing to buy the product at this price, so I need to consider that option.",800000.0,Alice,5,,
