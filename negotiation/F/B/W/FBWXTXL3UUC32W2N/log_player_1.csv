Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a decent profit. It also allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to come up to a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer is still a bit lower than my ideal price but it’s a significant increase from Bob’s offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already demonstrated my willingness to negotiate, and further rounds are unlikely to get me closer to my target price.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
