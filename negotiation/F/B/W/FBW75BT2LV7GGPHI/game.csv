"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While I see the value in the product, $11,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
