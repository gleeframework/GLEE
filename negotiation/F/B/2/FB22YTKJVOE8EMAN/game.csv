"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you valuing the product for me, but $1200000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still slightly above my budget. Would you consider $1000000? I'm very interested in this product and am confident that this price is fair for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not quite ready to go all the way down to $1000000. How about we meet in the middle at $1025000? That's the best I can do for now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
