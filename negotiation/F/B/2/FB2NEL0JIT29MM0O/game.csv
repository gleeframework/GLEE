"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, but I need to stay within that range. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate further. Considering your offer and the value of the product, I propose we meet in the middle at $95. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",95.0,Alice,3,
