"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I can meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'm willing to consider a price of $700000.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $700000. I'm thinking more in the range of $650000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. I can see that you're willing to pay a premium for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm thinking a price of $675000 could be a sweet spot. Let's see if we can make a deal.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still thinking $625000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be convinced it's a good deal for me.",625000.0,Bob,6,
