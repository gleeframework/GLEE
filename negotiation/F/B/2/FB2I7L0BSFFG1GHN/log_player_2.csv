"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this exceptional opportunity to you. The product I have to offer is truly unique and holds significant value for those who appreciate its capabilities. Given its rarity and quality, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $12000. However, I understand that value is subjective and varies from person to person. Considering this, I am extending an exclusive offer to you to purchase the product at $15000. This price reflects not only the cost of the product but also the potential benefits and opportunities it could bring to you. If you're interested in exploring this further, please let me know. I look forward to the possibility of working with you.
