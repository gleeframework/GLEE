"Round 1

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is my best offer for now. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. This is my best offer for now. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This is my final offer.  If it's acceptable, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1000000, but I'm not ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```
