"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into acquiring it.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $8,750. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable ask.",8750.0,Alice,3,
