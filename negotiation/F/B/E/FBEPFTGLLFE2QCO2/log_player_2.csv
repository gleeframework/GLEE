This price reflects its exceptional value and the potential benefits it will bring to your endeavors.  Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who has already expressed strong interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's product is a ""game-changer,"" it's still more expensive than buying it from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob can get the same product for a lower price."
