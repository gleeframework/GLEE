"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
