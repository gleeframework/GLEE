Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly implies Bob would be getting a good deal even at the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in discussion.

By starting at $15,000, Alice gives herself room to potentially:

1. **Secure a higher profit:** Bob might accept the initial offer.
2. **Negotiate down:** If Bob counters, Alice can gradually decrease the price, aiming for something above her $12,000 minimum. 

Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price."
