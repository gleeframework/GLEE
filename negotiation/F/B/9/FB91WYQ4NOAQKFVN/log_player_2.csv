"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** While my counteroffer is low, I'm keeping the tone polite and respectful to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By aiming for $70, I'm positioning myself well below my maximum budget ($100) and slightly above Alice's value ($80).  This gives us both room to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me. Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to her valuation, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 might have been a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $78 is a strong offer. It's a fair deal for both of us, still allowing me to save money while potentially exceeding Alice's minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Consideration:**  As negotiations continue, there's always a risk Alice walks away. This offer attempts to reach an agreement quickly while the opportunity is still good."
