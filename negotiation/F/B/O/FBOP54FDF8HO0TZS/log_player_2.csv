**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth negotiating to try and get a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can reach an agreement."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $14,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $15,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly.
