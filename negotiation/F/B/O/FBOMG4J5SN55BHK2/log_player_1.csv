Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $130, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value proposition to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get close to my minimum value. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The lower price allows for negotiation while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Plan B:**  John is my backup, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed alternative with John. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's still a great price for you, and I can make it work on my end."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $115. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a healthy profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob while reiterating my need for a higher price. I'm trying to build rapport and avoid a stalemate.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** Meeting Bob halfway can lead to a quicker agreement while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintain Value:** $115 is still closer to my minimum value than Bob's offer. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects again, I can adjust my offer slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? That's the highest I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum value of $150, but it's very close.  Considering that John is my only other option and his offer is $150, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. I will still make a profit, and it's likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming and may result in a lower offer from Bob or a lost sale altogether."
