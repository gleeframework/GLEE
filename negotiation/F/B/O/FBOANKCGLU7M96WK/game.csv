"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $180? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can do $170, but that's as low as I can go. The product is worth more than that to me, and I need to make a profit. Can we meet at $170?",170.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. I can do $168, but that's as low as I can go. I really think this product will be worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Can we shake on it?",168.0,Alice,7,
