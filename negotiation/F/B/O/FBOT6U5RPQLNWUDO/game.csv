"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is my maximum, considering the value I see in the product. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for your business. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value and the substantial returns you'll see.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the product's value, $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's try to find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is my absolute maximum, but I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the potential of the product while staying within my financial limitations.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
