Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This price reflects its value and gives you a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $1,400,000 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You are still above your minimum price of $1,500,000, leaving room for potential concessions. 
* **It sets a clear expectation:** This offer clearly indicates that you are serious about selling, but also not desperate to make a quick deal.

By opening with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a productive negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $1,300,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still allows for a fair profit for me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between your needs and mine. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up slightly with his offer, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made concessions, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome. 

To maximize my earnings, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This is a guaranteed sale at my desired price and avoids further uncertainty with Bob."
