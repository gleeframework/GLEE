Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than his initial value of $8,000, it's still too low for me. I have a few rounds left and John is willing to pay my minimum price.  I think I can still get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still aiming to stay under $8,500. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While he's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not there yet. With John waiting in the wings, I have a safety net, and I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $8,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900, and I'm hoping we can close this deal.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8900}
