# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is asking for $90.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $87? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and you're still saving money compared to buying from John.  Accepting her offer is the best choice."
