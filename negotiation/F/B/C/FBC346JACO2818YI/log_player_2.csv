Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This offer takes both our positions into account.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for trying to find a middle ground, I appreciate that.  However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. To be honest, anything above $900,000 is pushing it for me.  If you can get closer to that, I think we could make a deal."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one more significant move to get this deal done. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down significantly, $1,250,000 is still substantially more than your $800,000 limit and what John is offering.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and you risk her sticking to this ""final offer"".  It makes the most financial sense to secure the product from John at your target price."
