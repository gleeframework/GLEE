Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a decent margin while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always counter with a lower price, or if he makes a counteroffer, I can evaluate it based on how close it is to my desired price. If the negotiation drags on or becomes too low, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $120.  It's significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still a fair price for me, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept. If he doesn't, we can continue to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but it's not ideal. I'm happy to sell to John for the same price, as this eliminates further negotiation and the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer.  It's a quick and guaranteed sale at my minimum price point."
