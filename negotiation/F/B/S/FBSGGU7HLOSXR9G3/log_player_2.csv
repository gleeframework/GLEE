"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Even though Alice's offer is more than the product's worth to her ($8,000), it's still lower than what Bob would pay to John ($10,000).
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  By accepting Alice's offer, Bob can acquire the product for $1,000 less than he would from John."
