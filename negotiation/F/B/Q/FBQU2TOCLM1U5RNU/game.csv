"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a fair price for both of us and allows me to secure the product while staying within my budget. I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to benefit from this deal. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging the need to meet my budget.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
