,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference. How about $14,250?  That's a fair price for both of us.  If you agree, we can finalize the sale.",14250.0,Alice,5,
