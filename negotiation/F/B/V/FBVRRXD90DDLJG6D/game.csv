"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the value I see in it while still being a good deal for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident that its true value is significantly higher.  Would you consider $1,350,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value is high, but I need a price that works for me too. I can do $1,250,000.  That's a significant investment on my end and demonstrates my seriousness about closing this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position and I'm motivated to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This represents a substantial investment on your end but also reflects the true value of this unique product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on the value, but $1,300,000 is still a stretch for my budget. My final offer is $1,275,000.  This is a fair price and I'm hopeful we can close the deal on this.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
