I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but we're running out of rounds, and it's not clear if we'll be able to reach an agreement. It's better to guarantee a sale with John and secure the $800,000, rather than risk not closing a deal with Bob and getting nothing."
