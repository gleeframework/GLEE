"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to anchor the negotiation lower than our actual top price ($150). This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Direct:** We maintain a friendly tone while clearly stating our price. 
* **Leaving Room:** Our offer is significantly lower, allowing for Alice to counter and for us to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still closer to her starting price than ours.  We'll reject and propose a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a price we're happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we settle on $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer splits the difference between our last offer ($100) and her current price ($130).  It shows we're willing to move, but also expect her to move significantly as well.
* **Approaching Our Limit:** This price is getting closer to our upper limit ($150), but still leaves us with some room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** We continue to be appreciative and aim for a collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $130 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is moving slowly, and at this pace, we may not reach a satisfactory price within the remaining rounds.
* **Leverage:** We have John's offer as a backup, which gives us some leverage.  Rejecting now might encourage Alice to make a more substantial move in the next round.
* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:** We're aiming for something closer to $115-120, and another rejection might push Alice closer to this range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking to make a fair profit, Alice.  To be honest, $125 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $118? That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 118
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're holding firm on our need for a lower price while acknowledging her position. 
* **Justifying Our Offer:** We give a reason for our price (our budget) without revealing our absolute limit. 
* **Direct Approach:** We directly ask if she's willing to accept our offer, signaling that we're getting close to a make-or-break point in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price for both of us, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice has explicitly stated that $120 is her lowest price. It's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate further.
* **Good Deal:**  $120 is a good price, well below John's offer and saving us $30 from our upper limit.
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have a few rounds left, and continuing to negotiate might result in losing the deal altogether."
