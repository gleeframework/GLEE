"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the chance to own this truly unique product.  It's something I highly value, but I believe its true potential can be unlocked in the right hands.  I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is considerably below its true value.  This product is a game-changer, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure this is a fair deal. How about $1,225,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $1,225,000.  How about we meet at $1,150,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal and me to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
