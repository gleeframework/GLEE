Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming higher than $1,100,000. Bob is showing willingness to negotiate upwards."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure this is a fair deal. How about $1,225,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $1,225,000.  How about we meet at $1,150,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal and me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, accepting $1,150,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's $150,000 above my minimum and a healthy profit margin.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations has risks. Bob could walk away, or I might miss other opportunities.
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, potentially beneficial for future dealings. 

It's always tempting to squeeze out every dollar, but a timely and favorable deal is often the smarter move in business."
