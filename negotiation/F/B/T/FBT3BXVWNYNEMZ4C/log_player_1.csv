Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than $100.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, and I'll get the minimum ($100) from John. However, there's also a chance Bob values the product more than he's letting on and will pay a premium."
