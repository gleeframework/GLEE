You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the maximum you're willing to pay ($1,500,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've outlined, $500,000 is below my budget for this type of product. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, reflecting its potential value and recognizing the effort you've put into its development.  Let me know if this price works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
