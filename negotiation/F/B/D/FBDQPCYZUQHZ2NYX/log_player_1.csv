Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $95 is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum ($80) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message is friendly and highlights the product's value for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and engaging with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $85 is close to my minimum ($80), it's still not a profitable enough deal for me.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still potentially get a higher price from Bob by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Exploring better options:** Even if Bob doesn't budge, I can always fall back to selling to John for $80, so I have no risk in rejecting Bob's offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle.  How about $90?  That's still a great price for the product, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $90 splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that $90 is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** The message encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer and potentially come to an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually agreeable price while remaining profitable for me."
