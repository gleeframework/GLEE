"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's asking $95. This means there's room for negotiation.
* You're willing to pay up to $100, so you can afford to make a counteroffer.
* Rejecting the initial offer gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle.  How about $90?  That's still a great price for the product, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $90, which is still within your budget. 
* You're saving $10 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer, leaving you with only the option of buying from John at a higher price."
