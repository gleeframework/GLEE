"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $20000 for it. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $20000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting from the product.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $10000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one last compromise.  Let's settle at $12000.  This price would be fair for both of us.  I really think this product is a great fit for you and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. I'm hoping you'll consider it.",10000.0,Bob,6,
