"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to your specific needs, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $1,000,000. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,250,000 is more reflective of that. This takes into account the potential benefits you stand to gain. Are you open to discussing this further?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
