# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows you to purchase the product from John at your maximum price point."
