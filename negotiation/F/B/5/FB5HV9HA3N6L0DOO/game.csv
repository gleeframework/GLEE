"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price is fair considering the product's worth to me and its potential value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my financial situation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000.
