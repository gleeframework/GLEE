Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $1,350,000. Can you consider this offer?

While we're getting closer, Bob's offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds for a potentially smaller gain."
