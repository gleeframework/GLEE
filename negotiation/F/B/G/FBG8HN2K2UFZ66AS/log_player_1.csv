Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm going to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a little more.  I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to miss out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise here. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $9,200 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and it gets me closer to my desired price."
