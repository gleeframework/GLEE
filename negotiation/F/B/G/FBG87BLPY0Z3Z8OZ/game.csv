,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting close to my budget limit. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
