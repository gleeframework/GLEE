Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  While my asking price is $19,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $17,000."", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, Alice knows it's worth at least $15,000 to her and has another buyer.  Starting with a higher offer (but not ridiculously high) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning an ""asking price"" and a discounted offer, Alice subtly implies there might be other interested buyers. This encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob is a skilled negotiator, Alice might still secure a price higher than $15,000.

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price acceptable to her. She has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John."
