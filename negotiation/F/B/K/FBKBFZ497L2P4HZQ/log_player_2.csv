"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value and the fact that it's worth $12,000 to you, I propose a price of $11,500 to make this deal attractive yet profitable for both parties. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than the $12,000 you'd pay John.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, it's in your best interest to accept her offer and save $500."
