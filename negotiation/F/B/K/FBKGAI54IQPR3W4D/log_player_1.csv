Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring I get a profit significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise,  lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price to Bob, while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is too low for me.  While I'd prefer to make a profit larger than $1,500,000, I'm confident I can get that from John. I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I get a price that is acceptable to me and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
