""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing terms further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This allows me to consider the purchase while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I respect the value you see in the product, I must remain within my financial constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and acknowledges the product's worth, while still aligning with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better outcome with Bob, and there's the risk he could walk away. Taking the sure $1,200,000 now is the most logical choice."
