"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product for me. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $600,000.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $500,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $550,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on it. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $525,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell and me to secure the product at a reasonable price.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",525000.0,Bob,4,
