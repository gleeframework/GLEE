"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering it for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $11,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate, but also his firm commitment to a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above his desired price point.  He's willing to keep negotiating, hoping Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer while still trying to maintain his desired price. This shows his desire to reach an agreement while also demonstrating his commitment to getting a good deal."
