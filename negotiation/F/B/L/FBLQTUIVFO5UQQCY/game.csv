"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $8000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your original offer.",8500.0,Alice,3,
