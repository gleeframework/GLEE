"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $500000 for this item. This is a fair price considering its unique qualities, but I'm flexible and open to discussion. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $500000. Considering its unique qualities and the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this product. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $750000 is still a bit high for my budget, but I'm willing to go a bit higher.  How about $650000? This would allow us both to make a fair deal, and I'm still confident it's a good value considering the unique features of this product. I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $700000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $725000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's unique features. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
