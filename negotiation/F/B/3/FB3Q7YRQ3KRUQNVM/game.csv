"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This is a fair price considering its benefits.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $13,000?  I believe that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my budgetary constraints.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is still too low for me to accept.  Could you meet me at $16,000? That's my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. I'm very interested in the product, but $16,000 is just a bit beyond what I've budgeted. Would you be willing to settle at $15,500?  I'm ready to close the deal immediately at that price.",15500.0,Bob,6,
