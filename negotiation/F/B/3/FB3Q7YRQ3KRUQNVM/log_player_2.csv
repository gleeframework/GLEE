"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to that?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  While $10,000 is a significant difference from Alice's offer, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Express Interest:**  The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product to encourage Alice to work towards a deal.
* **Leave Room for Compromise:** This counteroffer leaves ample room for negotiation, allowing for potential compromises in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This is a fair price considering its benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice moved closer to Bob's price range, $17,500 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's still room to lower the price further. 
* **Deadline Awareness:**  With several rounds remaining, Bob can afford to continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $13,000?  I believe that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my budgetary constraints."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob raises his offer by $3,000, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significantly lower price.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates budget limitations and emphasizes the offer's fairness.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to the $15,000 mark, which is Bob's ideal target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is still too low for me to accept.  Could you meet me at $16,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:**  $16,000 is close to John's offer, but Bob can still try to negotiate a slightly better deal. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her final offer. However, it doesn't mean the negotiation is over. Bob can try one last time. 
* **Potential Leverage:**  Time is on Bob's side. Alice might be more willing to compromise as the deadline approaches."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. I'm very interested in the product, but $16,000 is just a bit beyond what I've budgeted. Would you be willing to settle at $15,500?  I'm ready to close the deal immediately at that price."",
""product_price"": 15500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Respectful Acknowledgment:**  Bob acknowledges Alice's ""final offer"" statement but still attempts to negotiate.
* **Small Concession:** A $500 counteroffer shows Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while staying below John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating his readiness to close the deal, Bob creates a sense of urgency and encourages a quick decision. 
* **Backup Option:**  If Alice rejects this counteroffer, Bob can still buy from John at $15,000 without losing much."
