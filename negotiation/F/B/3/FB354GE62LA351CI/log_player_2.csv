"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer is exactly $120, there's no incentive to negotiate. Buying from John immediately guarantees the purchase at your maximum price."
