"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I believe it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his range and can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial $2,000,000 offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,800,000, I'm willing to accept this offer as it's only $100,000 less. I'm also concerned about running out of rounds and potentially having to settle for John's offer of $1,500,000."
