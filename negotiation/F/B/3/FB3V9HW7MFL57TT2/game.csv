"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6000 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $6000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $8000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close to accepting the offer, but I was thinking maybe we could meet in the middle at $7900? That way, I'd be saving $100 and you'd still be making a profit. What do you think?",7900.0,Bob,6,
