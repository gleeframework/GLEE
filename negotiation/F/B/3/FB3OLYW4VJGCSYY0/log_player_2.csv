It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to you, there's room to bargain."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower offer, hoping to get a good deal.  Since I'm willing to pay $10,000, this gives Alice some room to negotiate while still saving me money."

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is only $500 more than what John is offering. It's worth it to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
