"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000, Bob. I think $13,000 is a bit too low for the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $14,000. Can we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,7,
