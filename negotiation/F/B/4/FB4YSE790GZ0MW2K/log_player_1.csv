Let's see how Bob responds! This starting price aims to secure a good profit while leaving room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it leaves very little profit margin. I'll try to negotiate for a better price before settling for $100 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims for a compromise, still securing a profit above John's offer while potentially being agreeable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still too high for me. How about $108? I'm willing to pay a little more than my initial offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to stay within a certain budget. Accepting his offer of $108 secures a profit above John's offer, and further haggling might risk losing the sale altogether."
