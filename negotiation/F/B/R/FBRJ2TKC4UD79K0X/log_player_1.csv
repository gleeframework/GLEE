"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($100) but not too high to deter Bob from the negotiation. This gives me room to bargain and allows for a potential middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold of $100.  I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $80 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $95? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
