"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  $9,000 is still too high for him, and he knows there's a fallback option with John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,800. It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really benefit from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $8,800 is within his budget and represents a good deal compared to John's price of $10,000.  While there's always the possibility of a lower price, the potential savings are small, and it's likely Alice won't go lower than $8,500 which is her ideal price."
