Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is upbeat and highlights the potential value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to discussion and willing to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I have a backup option with John, allowing me to walk away if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and far less than my initial offer. Accepting would result in a large loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** While Bob's initial counteroffer is low, it shows he's interested. Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially find a middle ground.
* **John is a Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above his initial counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a reasonable price for me.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces the rationale for a slightly higher price.
* **Open to Agreement:**  The message is positive and aims to keep the negotiation going.
* **John as a Backup:**  I still have the option of selling to John if negotiations break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $75? That seems fair to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $75 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation and potentially reaching a price that's more favorable for me.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  Selling to John for $150 is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer, especially considering the potential to get a higher price through continued negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? This is a fair price that acknowledges both our positions. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This offer is exactly halfway between my last offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $75, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and encouraging, aiming to create a sense of urgency and get Bob to accept.
* **Finality:**  The phrase ""Let's close this deal!"" implies that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **John Still Available:**  Selling to John for $150 is still a viable option if Bob rejects this offer, but it's becoming less appealing as the negotiation progresses."
