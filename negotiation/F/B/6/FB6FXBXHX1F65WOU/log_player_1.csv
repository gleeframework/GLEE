Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** While the offer is high, I provide a reason (""great deal for the value"") to make it seem less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By phrasing it as an offer, I signal that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating the price. 

My strategy is to start high and gauge Bob's reaction. Depending on his counteroffer, I can decide whether to negotiate further or take the guaranteed $100 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is closer to his perceived value but still above his actual valuation. While I could accept and make a $10 profit, there's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price.  Selling to John for $100 is my safety net, but I'll try one more time with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we split the difference and settle at $105? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a split-the-difference approach, I signal a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Anchoring:**  Even though I'm willing to go lower, I'm keeping the price anchored closer to my initial offer ($120) than Bob's counteroffer ($90). This might influence his perception of the product's value.
* **Justification:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" attempts to make the price more appealing. 

I'm still leaving myself room to potentially accept a lower offer from Bob in the next round,  but I want to test his willingness to go higher first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking close to his initial offer and signaling that $95 is his upper limit. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting his offer would only net me a $15 profit, while I have a guaranteed $20 profit by selling to John. It's time to take the safe and more profitable option."
