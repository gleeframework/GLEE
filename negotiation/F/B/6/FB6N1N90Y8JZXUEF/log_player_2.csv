"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd love! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, Alice's message hints that she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better deal from Alice."
