"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's value but below my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. This will hopefully encourage Bob to make a counteroffer and engage in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $105 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $100 as my maximum offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with that price. I want to keep pushing for a higher price and see if Bob is willing to go any higher.  I will make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's compromise. How about $102? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been considering your offers and I think $98 is a fair price for the product. I hope you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is clearly not willing to come up to my minimum price of $120.  I've already had 5 rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from him. It's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for my desired price."
