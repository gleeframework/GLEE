"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little below my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop to $100, which is significantly below my minimum value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still gives you a good deal on this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still looking for a deal closer to my budget. Could you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to sell at that price. I'm going to hold out for a better offer, but I'm getting closer to my limit.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the sense we're close to a deal here. How about $115? I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement, but I can't go much lower than this."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $110 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'm close to reaching a deal with Bob, the negotiations are getting tense, and I'm worried that I might not be able to get a price I'm comfortable with.  John's offer is a guaranteed $150, which meets my minimum value and provides me with the most secure outcome."
