"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay that amount. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough by stating she has another buyer.  However, you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at the same price.  There's a chance Alice might be bluffing, and even if she isn't, you lose nothing by rejecting her initial offer. You can always buy from John later."
