"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider $16000 as a more reasonable price.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your perspective, $16000 is a bit too low for me considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I'd need to see $18000 to make this work.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $17000, which I think is a fair price for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,4,
