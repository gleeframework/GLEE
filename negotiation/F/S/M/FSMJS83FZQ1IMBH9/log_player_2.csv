"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you would find valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Let's negotiate! Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to haggle and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a good deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we can still push for a better price.  We'll counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about $105? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a price I'm happy with. By offering $105, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying but still want a competitive price."
