"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly rated by many satisfied customers. Considering its quality and features, I believe it's worth more than $150. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is significantly higher than our target price and our fallback option with John. We should negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We begin with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This tactic establishes a negotiation space and gives us room to move upwards.
* **Anchoring:** By stating a specific price ($60), we aim to influence Alice's perception of the product's value to us. This is a common negotiation tactic called ""anchoring.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Our counteroffer acknowledges Alice's valuation while making our budget constraints clear. This approach invites further negotiation and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value of the product, I think we can find a middle ground. How about if I offer the product to you for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice has significantly lowered her price from $120 to $90, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  While $90 is closer to our target, it's still above our ideal price and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about a lower price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $70.  Would you consider $68?"",
""product_price"": 68
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're raising our offer from $60 to $68, showing Alice we're willing to move towards her price, but in smaller increments.
* **Specific Target:**  We reiterate our desired price range (under $70), keeping our goal clear.
* **Reaching a Compromise:**  $68 is a reasonable compromise – closer to our ideal price while still representing a significant discount for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $75 for the product. It's still above your initial offer, but I believe it's fair considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice has come down considerably and we're getting close. However, $75 is still above our fallback option with John.
* **Limited Rounds:** We have five rounds left, and it's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get closer to $70.
* **Potential Leverage:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, we signal our willingness to walk away if necessary, which might incentivize her to make a final concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $75 is very tempting, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear this is our best and last offer, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Middle Ground:**  $70 is a fair compromise – exactly halfway between her last offer ($75) and ours ($68). 
* **Alternative Option:** By implicitly reminding Alice that we have the option to go with John, we maintain some negotiating leverage."
