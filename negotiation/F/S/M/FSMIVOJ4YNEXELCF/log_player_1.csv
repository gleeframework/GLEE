Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $130 is still a bit low, but I want to see if I can get him up a little."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 135}
