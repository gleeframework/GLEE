"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me.  I'm more comfortable in the $600,000 range.  Do you think we can work something out closer to that?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value this product brings.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That's a significant investment on my part, but I'm willing to make it if it means closing this deal today.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $775,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and my last offer of $850,000. I'm counteroffering at $812,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",812500.0,Alice,7,
