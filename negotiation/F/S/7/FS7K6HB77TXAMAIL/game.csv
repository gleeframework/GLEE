"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair, considering its value to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This allows you a substantial profit while offering me a competitive price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and the time it's taken to negotiate so far.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
