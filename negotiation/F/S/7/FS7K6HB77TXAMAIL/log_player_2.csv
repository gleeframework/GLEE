Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and the time it's taken to negotiate so far.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit high. I'm confident we can reach a deal closer to $1,000,000. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's desired price point of $1,000,000.
* **Limited time:**  With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases, potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Alice's ""bottom line"":** Alice has stated this is her absolute minimum, suggesting further negotiation may be unproductive.

While it's not Bob's ideal price, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this situation. It's a good deal compared to buying from John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations failing."
