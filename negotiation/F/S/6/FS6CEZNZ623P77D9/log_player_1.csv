Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $100, we don't want to start too low. This leaves room for negotiation or allows us to settle at a price higher than his perceived value.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even a vague one, can make the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $125 gives Bob the potential to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" while still netting you a profit significantly higher than selling to John.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and any additional information you might glean about Bob, you could adjust your offer."
