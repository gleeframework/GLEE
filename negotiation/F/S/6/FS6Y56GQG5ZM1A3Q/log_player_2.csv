"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and allows me to achieve a better return than selling to another buyer. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
