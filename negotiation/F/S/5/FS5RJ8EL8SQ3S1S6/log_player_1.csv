Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the message emphasizes ""fair deal"" and ""return on investment"" to make it more appealing.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, I might adjust the price or message in subsequent interactions."
