{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer sets a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize profit.  However, it's a reasonable starting point considering I have a guaranteed fallback option with John."
