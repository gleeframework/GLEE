"Thanks Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $106. That's a good price for me, and I think it's still fair to you.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we try $108? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",108.0,Alice,5,
