"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. If you're open to negotiation, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer to my range, it's still a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $1200000 for this product. This reflects its value and my budget constraints.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to let it go without getting a better deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'll counteroffer at $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
