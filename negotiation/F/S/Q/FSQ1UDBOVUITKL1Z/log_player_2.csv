"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can do better than $12,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

You're still closer to your goal of getting the product for less than $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
