"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but Alice is asking for $90. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:**  There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price. 
* **John is a backup:** Having John as an alternative keeps you in a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your desired price:**  Alice has moved down to $87.50, which is only $2.50 more than what you were willing to pay initially.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing the price back up or losing Alice as a seller altogether.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If you reject Alice's offer, you can still buy from John, but his price is higher. 

It's a good deal, and you can save some money."
