Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value.

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and we haven't been able to reach an agreement. We're both stubborn and neither of us is willing to budge much. It's clear that we are at an impasse.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether. John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000, which is more than Bob's final offer.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
