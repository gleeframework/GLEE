"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $12,000. How about we compromise at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. How about we meet at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $11,250 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $11,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your offer than my last one.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go above $11,250. I think it's a fair price for the product.",11250.0,Bob,8,
