"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

You can likely get a better deal from Alice.  $120 is still too high for your target price of $150.  Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

Let's start by offering Alice $100.  This is a significant price reduction from her initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget. It's a good deal, and accepting avoids the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer or you having to buy from John for a higher price."
