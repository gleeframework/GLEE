Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to reject it and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that reaching an agreement with Bob will be difficult.  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
