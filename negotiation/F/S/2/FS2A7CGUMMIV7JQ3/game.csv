"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, which reflects the value I see in this product.  It's a fair price that I believe we can both be happy with.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're open to that price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
