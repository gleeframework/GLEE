"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) and slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential concessions.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a good deal. This helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, acknowledging that we may need to negotiate to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. I can use the next round to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is still a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. However, I'm willing to explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $13,500?  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and  increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his initial offer, making him more likely to consider a higher price.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  I'm aiming to reach a deal in as few rounds as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $13,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could you do $11,500? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There's room for further negotiation, and I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  I'm still considering selling to John for $15,000 as my current best option. However, I'm willing to explore one more round of negotiation with Bob before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it would be a great deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This is likely my final concession.
* **Highlighting the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the discount from my initial offer and highlighting the value for Bob. This encourages him to accept.
* **Urgency:** While not explicitly stated, the message hints at a deadline. This subtle pressure may push Bob to make a decision. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000, which is still a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close to what I can do. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds left:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the chances of further negotiation are slim.
* **John offers a better deal:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is the most financially beneficial option at this point. There's little chance of reaching a better deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
