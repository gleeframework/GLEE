"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating. There's also the option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the initial offer keeps these options open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. It sets a strong starting point for the negotiation. 

Bob is trying to secure the product for as close to his maximum value of $1,000,000 as possible.  By offering $1,050,000, he demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further counteroffers if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer and is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  Rejecting this offer keeps open the possibility of a lower price, potentially closer to Bob's target price or even the price offered by John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is a compromise between Alice's offer and his desired price.  $1,100,000 is a midpoint between the two, showing that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still looking to save as much money as possible. This is a reasonable counteroffer that might be acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her initial offer of $1,200,000. This indicates that she may be unwilling to lower her price further.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential for a lower price is becoming less likely. 

Given that John offers the product for $1,000,000, which is Bob's maximum value, it is the most logical decision to buy the product from John. This ensures that Bob gets the product at his desired price and saves a significant amount of money compared to accepting Alice's offer."
