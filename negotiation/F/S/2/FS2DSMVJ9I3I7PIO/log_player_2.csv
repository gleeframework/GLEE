"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I see the value in this product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer to test the waters. This price is still within his budget, but it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. By making a bold move, Bob hopes to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met Bob halfway, offering a price of $13,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, as it's below his initial maximum price of $15,000 and significantly better than Alice's first offer.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a fair price without risking a further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a stalemate."
