"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
