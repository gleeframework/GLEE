Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point given that the product is worth the same to him.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $850,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $800,000 to him, but it also brings me closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be a more agreeable price point for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered my minimum price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
