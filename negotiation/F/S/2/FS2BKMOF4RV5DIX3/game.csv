"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $200 was a starting point,  How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $120, as that's still a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $120. How about we split the difference again and settle at $140? This is my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
