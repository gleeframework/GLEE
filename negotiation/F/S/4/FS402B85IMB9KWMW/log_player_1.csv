{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is higher than $80, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $110 is still higher than your $120 minimum, ensuring a profit.
* **It leaves room for compromise:** You can potentially lower the price a bit if Bob counteroffers. 

This strategy focuses on securing a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** $90 is less than your $120 minimum, so accepting it would mean a loss. 
* **You have a better option:**  John is willing to pay $120, which is significantly better than Bob's offer. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  You can still counteroffer Bob, potentially securing a price closer to your desired value. 

While accepting Bob's offer would be quick, it's not the most profitable strategy. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This is a counter-offer to Bob's $90 offer.
* **Split the Difference:** The offer of $100 is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90).
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness and the product's value, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Flexibility:** This offer leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant.

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties and pushes the price closer to your desired value while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $95 is still below your minimum selling price of $120. Accepting would mean selling at a loss.
* **John is a better option:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation room:** While $95 is closer, it's still not ideal. You can potentially counteroffer again, but the risk of losing John's sale is increasing with each round. 

It's tempting to accept Bob's offer because it's getting closer to your desired price, but it's still not a good deal for you.  Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $105? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This is a counter-offer to Bob's $95 offer.
* **Small Increase:** The offer of $105 is a small increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Discount:**  The message highlights the discount from your initial offer to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Finality:** This offer could be considered a final offer, implying that you are less willing to negotiate further.

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties while minimizing the risk of losing John's offer.  It is a slightly higher offer than Bob's, but the message emphasizes the value of the product and the discount offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $105, which would be $92.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $92.5 is still significantly below your minimum selling price of $120. Accepting would mean selling at a loss.
* **John is the better option:**  John offers a guaranteed sale for $120, which is far more profitable than Bob's current offer. 
* **Risk of losing John:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's offer altogether. 

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's getting closer to your desired price, it's still not a good deal for you. Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point. It's better to secure the guaranteed sale with John than to continue risking a lower price with Bob."
