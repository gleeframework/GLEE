"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's unlikely she offered her lowest price right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  A counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This leaves room for further negotiation while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product while clearly stating the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're still quite a bit away from our target price. We made a substantial move in the first round, so now it's time to see how much further Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Increment:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate but in smaller increments, indicating we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Mentioning Market Value:**  Subtly reminding Alice of other options (""market value"") can encourage her to be more flexible. 
* **Aiming for a Sweet Spot:** We're aiming for a price point between her current offer and our initial counteroffer, hoping to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 might still be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer. Continuing to negotiate might irritate her and jeopardize the deal.
* **Savings:** While not ideal, $11,200 is still a $3,800 savings compared to John's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential savings from further negotiation are now outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely."
