"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 might still be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
