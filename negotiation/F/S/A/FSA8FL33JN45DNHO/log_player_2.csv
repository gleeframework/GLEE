"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a significant discount from your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept, there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps you in the driver's seat and allows you to try for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal. Let's aim for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1080000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $1,050,000.  At this point, it's likely that you won't get a significantly better price.  Accepting her offer saves you time and avoids the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer.  It's a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000."
