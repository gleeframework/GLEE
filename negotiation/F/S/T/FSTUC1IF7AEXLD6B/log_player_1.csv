Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I think it would be a valuable addition to what you're doing, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible. Offering it slightly below this at $14,999 maximizes potential profit.
* **Urgency and Value Perception:**  The message implies scarcity and value, encouraging Bob to act quickly.  
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines."
