"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your price point, $9,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the product's value and still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  That would be a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer,  $9,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  This would be a fair compromise that meets both our needs.",10125.0,Alice,5,
