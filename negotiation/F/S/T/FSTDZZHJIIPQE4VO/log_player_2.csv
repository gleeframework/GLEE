"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm open to discussing this further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($10,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better deal. We'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value this brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, $13,250 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll counter with a price closer to my target of $12,000 to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'll offer $12,750.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly interested in this product and recognize its value.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $13,000. How about we settle at $13,100? This feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,100 is still too high, and we are approaching the halfway point of our rounds. While I'm committed to getting a good deal, I want to ensure I'm not spending too much. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,100 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to finalize this deal at $12,900.  This feels like a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 12900}
