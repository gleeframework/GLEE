"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $12000. Would you be open to negotiating closer to that figure?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend $12000, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16000 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14000 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we meet at $13000? It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $16000. How about we meet at $14500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
