"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired value. It's also a significant enough number to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I will reject his offer and try to get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. It shows that I am willing to negotiate, but I am also not desperate to sell for a low price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it again. I've already shown I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll try to get a higher offer from Bob in the next round."

```

I'm counteroffering at $1,650,000. I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling, and that I'm willing to meet him halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I will reject it and try to get a higher price.  Although I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price and running out of rounds, I'm not willing to settle just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer and brings me closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I am starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I am still hoping to get a slightly higher price from Bob before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low and we're running out of time.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price than I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than taking a big loss."
