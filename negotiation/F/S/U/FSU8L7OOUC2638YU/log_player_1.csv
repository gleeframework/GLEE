Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $120}

This is a reasonable offer, considering the product is worth $80 to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $80 to me, I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. However, I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.
