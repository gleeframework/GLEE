I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a higher price than what it's worth to him, but it's still lower than what I could get from John. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** While $1,750,000 is less than my ideal price, it's still significantly more than what Bob values the product at. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  By starting high, I can gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for potential counteroffers from Bob, allowing us to find a mutually acceptable price within a reasonable range.

I will closely monitor Bob's responses and be ready to adjust my strategy if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my target price and even below what the product is worth to me.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Low offer:** Bob's offer is far too low, leaving me with a considerable loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiations.

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $1,000,000 but still lower than $1,750,000.  I'll aim to find a middle ground that's more favorable for me while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,250,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This price is a significant step up from Bob's offer but still significantly lower than my initial offer.  It shows my willingness to compromise while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about purchasing the product. If he's willing to come up from his initial $1,000,000 offer, it indicates he might be interested in a deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I've left some room for further negotiation, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob. 

I'm confident that this counteroffer positions me well for a successful negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for an unacceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to what I want, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiations, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation potential:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, which is positive. However, it's still not in my best interest to accept.
* **Room for improvement:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer.  I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my ideal range.
* **John's offer:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to continue negotiations with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $1,100,000 but still lower than my previous offer of $1,250,000. I'll aim to find a price point where we both can find a mutually acceptable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This price represents a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to find common ground. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer aims to gauge Bob's commitment to the deal and see if he's willing to make a final push to close the gap. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving up on my goal of securing a higher price. I'm confident I can still get closer to my desired value. 

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be accepted, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
