Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation or a surprisingly quick acceptance.
* **Justification:**  A brief mention of ""value"" aims to frame the price as justified, even if Bob doesn't perceive the full $140 worth.
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly rather than overthink the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could experiment with different offers and messages to see what works best!"
