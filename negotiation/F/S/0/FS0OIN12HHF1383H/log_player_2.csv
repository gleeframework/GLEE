Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. While I see the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for my budget.  I will continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,100,000 is still above what I can afford.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is a very fair price for this product.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to buy the product from John at $1,000,000 than continue negotiating with Alice, as I'm running out of rounds and the offer isn't getting any closer to my target price."
