# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $900,000 from Alice, saving $600,000 compared to John's price.
* **The product is worth more to you than Alice.** You value it at $1,500,000, so paying $900,000 is still a good deal for you."
