"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",10800.0,Bob,4,
