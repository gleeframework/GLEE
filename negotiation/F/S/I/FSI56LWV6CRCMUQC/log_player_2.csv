"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. It's clear there's room for negotiation. You'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer significantly lower, moving closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have budget constraints. I could consider a price closer to  $800,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening, but it's within your budget and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, you aim to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range.
* **Justification:** Mentioning your budget constraints gives Alice a reason to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding you have budget considerations.  However,  $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $2,000,000.  This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a considerable gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved a bit from her initial offer,  $2,000,000 is still far above your $1,000,000 limit. It seems there's a significant gap to bridge. It's worth trying to negotiate further, but you need to show Alice you're serious about a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than what I can justify. This product would be a worthwhile investment for me at a price closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to be flexible, but that price point is a firm requirement for me to move forward."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Increase, Firm Stance:** You're increasing your offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but you're also setting a firm boundary at $900,000.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating that this price is a ""firm requirement"" emphasizes that you're serious and might walk away if she doesn't budge significantly. 
* **Time Pressure:** As rounds progress, the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 becomes more appealing. This tactic subtly applies time pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product is undeniable. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable price considering the significant value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice has only dropped $500,000 in total, and her ""final offer"" is still far from your budget. 
* **John's Price is Appealing:** With each round, the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 becomes increasingly attractive.
* **Time to Push:** Alice needs to understand you're serious about your price limit and willing to walk away."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I'm sticking to my budget.  If you can't do  $950,000 for this product, I have to explore other options. I need to know by the next round if this works for you, as my other option is time-sensitive."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're presenting this as your final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Increase:**  A small increase to $950,000 shows you are still trying, but not willing to go far.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning a ""time-sensitive"" alternative strongly hints at John's deal without revealing the price. This puts pressure on Alice without being confrontational.
* **Clear Deadline:**  Demanding a decision by the next round forces Alice to be serious and prevents further stalling."
