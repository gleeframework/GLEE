Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still hoping to get closer to your asking price, but I'm not willing to go above $9500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $500 less than what I'd get from John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation.  There's a chance I could get a higher offer in the next round, but there's also a chance that Bob could lower his offer or even walk away from the deal entirely.  I'd rather secure the sale now at a price that's still very close to my minimum."
