This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000. However, I'm looking to spend a little less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a little less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
