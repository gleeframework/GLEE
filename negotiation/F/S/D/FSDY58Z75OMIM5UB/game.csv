"Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $15000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8000 is significantly below what it's worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $12000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to make a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
