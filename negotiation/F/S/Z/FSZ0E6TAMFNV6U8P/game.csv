"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product if the price is right.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $850000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900000. This still gives you a significant return on your investment. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the potential of this product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
