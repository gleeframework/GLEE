"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profits, so I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle of what the product is worth to me and Bob.
* **Friendly opening:**  I'm being polite and friendly to build rapport, which can help with negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the absolute highest price to leave room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, as he expressed interest in the product. 
* **Not rushing the sale:** Selling to John for $80 is a safe option, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting a fair deal:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is a ""good deal"" for both of us, which can make it more appealing.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  I'm not dropping my price significantly, suggesting that I'm still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $90.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's a significant improvement from Bob's previous offers.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's $80 offer is too high.
* **Positive momentum:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and accepting his offer will allow me to close the deal quickly."
