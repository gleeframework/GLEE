"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than my maximum price of $120, I can likely get a better deal. There are still 9 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a good starting point for negotiations.  $85 is still above Alice's value of $80, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is closer to my ideal price, it's still above my desired range.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can push Alice down even further. There are still 7 rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $90.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and keeps the negotiations moving forward. $90 is still within my acceptable price range and leaves room for further discussion."
