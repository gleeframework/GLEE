"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $90.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.",90.0,Bob,4,
