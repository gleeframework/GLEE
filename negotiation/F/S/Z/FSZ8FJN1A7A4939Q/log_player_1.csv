Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify spending more than $800,000. Let me know if that's something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000  to find common ground.

Bob's offer:

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price point that makes sense for me. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
