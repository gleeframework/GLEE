"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify spending more than $800,000. Let me know if that's something you can work with.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000  to find common ground. I believe this still reflects a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
