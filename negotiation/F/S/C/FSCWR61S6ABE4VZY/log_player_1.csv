Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John offers a guaranteed $12,000, Alice aims to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Offering slightly below $12,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially landing closer to $12,000.
* **High Likelihood of Acceptance:** The offer is appealing to Bob, as it's significantly below his perceived value of $10,000.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob with the security of John's guaranteed offer."
