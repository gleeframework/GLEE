"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,800,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,600,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value of the product. I can offer it to you for $1,550,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
