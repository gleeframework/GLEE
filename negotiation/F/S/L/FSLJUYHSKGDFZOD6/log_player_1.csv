Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $20,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's common in negotiations to start with a higher price, leaving room for negotiation. $20,000 is a good starting point, as it's above your minimum value but not outlandishly high.
* **Open-Ended Message:** The message is open-ended, allowing Bob to respond with a counteroffer or express interest without committing to a specific price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the potential value to Bob is crucial in encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the unique product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $18000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I'm willing to accept.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There's a chance that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 provides me with leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your budget constraints. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to make this work. This price still reflects the unique value it offers you."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Close to Bob's:**  My counteroffer is close to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise while still maximizing my profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and cooperative, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
