"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is a significant amount higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $150.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm phrasing the message in a way that suggests I'm open to negotiating, which could make Bob more likely to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is too Low:** While $90 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand $90 is a lower price point for you.  I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a good value for this product considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm coming down from my initial offer of $120 to $105, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he sees in the product, subtly hinting at the higher price he's willing to pay.
* **Open Ended Question:** I'm ending with an open ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially find a meeting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $97 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the longer this goes on, the more likely it is that I'll have to sell to John for $80. 
* **Potential for Higher Offers:**  While I might be able to get a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer, and I might end up with a lower price or have to sell to John. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of getting a worse deal or losing time."
