"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise and to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the potential benefits and value for Bob, making the offer seem attractive rather than just a transaction. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm indicating I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate. This keeps the door open for a deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer and consider whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own, always keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  Accepting it would be a substantial loss for me.
* **I have 8 rounds left, and there's room for negotiation.** I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer provides a safety net.** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for compromise.  I'll need to be strategic to find a price that's attractive to Bob while still protecting my interests."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 is unfortunately far below the value of this product.

I'm confident you'll find this a good deal, given the product's potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

* **Reiteration of Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential, hoping to sway him further towards a deal.

**Next Steps:**

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to close the deal, but $1550000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1450000 for the product.
