"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1000000 is unfortunately far below the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1750000. This price is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. I'm confident you'll find this a good deal, given the product's potential. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
