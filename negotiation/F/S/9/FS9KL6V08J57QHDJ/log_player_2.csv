"Round 1
Alice's offer:

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $100 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to pay $85 for the product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to keep negotiating.  Let's see if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  However, $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 88}

Alice is not budging much, and it's getting close to the end of our rounds.  It's not worth risking another round where she might counter with a price I can't accept. I'll buy from John and save myself the hassle."
