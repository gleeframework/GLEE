"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay up to $80 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. This is still above what we're valuing it at, but I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $100 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to pay $85 for the product.  Let's make a deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. Considering your offer, I propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this works for you, and I look forward to your response.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  However, $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $92 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. I look forward to your response.",92.0,Alice,7,
