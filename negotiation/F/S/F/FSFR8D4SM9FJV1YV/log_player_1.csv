Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $925,000?

Round 4

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my desired price point and within the range of what I'm willing to accept.  It's better than selling to John for $800,000.  I'll accept his offer."
