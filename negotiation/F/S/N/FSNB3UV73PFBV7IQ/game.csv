"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still struggling to reach that price point. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. I'm still not quite there.  $1,300,000 is my limit.  This is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product and the fact that I could go elsewhere for a similar deal.  Let's finalize this agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
