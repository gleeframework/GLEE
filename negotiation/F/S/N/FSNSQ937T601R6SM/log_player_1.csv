Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    * It's significantly less than your value ($1,000,000).
    * It's a substantial profit for you if he accepts.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of securing a higher price makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
