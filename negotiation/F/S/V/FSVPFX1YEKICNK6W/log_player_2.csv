"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to our ideal price range. It's a significant jump from Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I can't go as low as $11,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met us halfway between our last offer and her previous price.  While it's not ideal, it's only $500 more than buying from John, and further negotiation might not yield a better result."
