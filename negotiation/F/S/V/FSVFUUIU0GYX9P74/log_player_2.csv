"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's negotiate for a better price.  Alice is starting at $90, leaving room to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While the product looks great, $90 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims low to see how much Alice is willing to budge. There's a good chance she'll counter back, but it keeps us well below our $120 maximum and leaves space for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. She's met us halfway, now let's try to nudge the price a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $78? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between her last offer ($85) and our previous counter ($70). It shows we're willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $82. I think this is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $82 gets us the product for a good price, significantly below our $120 alternative."
