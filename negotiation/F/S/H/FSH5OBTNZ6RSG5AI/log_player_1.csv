Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Value to Bob:** The price is still attractive to Bob, as it's lower than what the product is worth to him.
* **Strategic messaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

This approach aims to start the negotiation in a favorable position while being open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm also aware of John's offer as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product, and his counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John for a price that meets my minimum requirements. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to secure a better deal while still having the option to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value you've stated for the product. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** While I'm not willing to accept Bob's initial offer, I'm showing flexibility by proposing a price halfway between our two last offers.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:** $13,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on fairness and highlighting the value Bob places on the product to encourage him to agree.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving room for potential further negotiation if necessary. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiation open for a possible agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? It's a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** While I could make a counteroffer, the negotiation seems to be stuck in a cycle of small increments, with little chance of reaching a price that meets my needs.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a surefire way to get the price I want. 

It's more efficient to sell to John now and avoid further negotiation with Bob, which is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome."
