"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $9,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still too high for me.  Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my genuine interest in your product. I'm confident we can find a deal that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
