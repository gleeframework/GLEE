"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your perspective, $1,100,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still reflects the product's worth and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to consider $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. This price still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
