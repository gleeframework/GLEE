Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $10,000 to you in the long run. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob helps justify the higher price. 
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net at $10,000, it's best to focus on maximizing profit with Bob. If the negotiation doesn't go well initially, you can always adjust your offer closer to $10,000 to ensure a sale."
