Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a saving compared to John's purchase price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially influencing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Why this approach can be effective:**

* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer, we anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, we're likely to settle at a price higher than if we started low.
* **Potential for Quick Sale:**  Bob might recognize the immediate value proposition (saving $100,000) and accept the offer without negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. A lot depends on your understanding of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
