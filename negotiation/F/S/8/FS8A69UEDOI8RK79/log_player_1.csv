Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum ($12,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **First-Refusal Advantage:** By emphasizing Bob's chance to buy ""before anyone else,"" you add a subtle sense of urgency and exclusivity.

**Why not ask for the full $15,000?**

While tempting, it's generally better to leave some room for negotiation. It shows a willingness to be fair and might prevent Bob from feeling like he's being taken advantage of, potentially leading to a quicker and smoother deal."
