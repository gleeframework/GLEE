"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000.  This still represents a significant value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This price is fair and reasonable for both of us, and it will allow us to move forward with this deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
