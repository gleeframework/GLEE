Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  I need to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still a bit above my maximum budget, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I've left room for negotiation, hoping to find a price we both can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. What do you think, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm not willing to go beyond $10,000, so I'll need to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,500. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reiterating my previous counteroffer of $10,500. This shows I'm firm in my position and am not willing to go higher. I'm also expressing a willingness to find a compromise, hoping to encourage Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $11,500. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $10,000 and will continue negotiating to see if we can find a solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay. Let's split the difference and settle at $10,750.  This would allow us both to come to an agreement that's fair."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Alice's current offer ($11,500).  This demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to meet her halfway. It's still within my budget, but it offers a significant concession that could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the value of this product. I'll meet you at $11,000. That's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While she has shown some willingness to negotiate, we're now at a point where I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  To avoid further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome, I'm choosing to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees me the product at a price I'm comfortable with, saving me time and potential frustration."
