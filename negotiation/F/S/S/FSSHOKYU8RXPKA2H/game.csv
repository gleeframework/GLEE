"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. What do you think, Bob?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,500. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $11,500. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay. Let's split the difference and settle at $10,750.  This would allow us both to come to an agreement that's fair.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the value of this product. I'll meet you at $11,000. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
