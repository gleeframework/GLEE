"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am interested in purchasing the product but within my budget constraints. Could you consider reducing the price to $1000000? I think this would allow us to move forward with the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1100000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also being reasonable for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
