"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $180? I'm willing to make a compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $180 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a slightly lower price? I'd be willing to pay $150 for the product.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $170? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",170.0,Alice,5,
