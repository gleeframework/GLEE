"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is above his budget, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John for $10,000, saving himself $1,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. He's likely aiming to find a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's latest counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,800 is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's also very close to his $10,000 limit with John, so it's worth trying for one more round of negotiation to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

Bob is increasing his offer again, but this time, he's getting very close to his limit. He's essentially testing the waters, seeing how far he can push Alice to come down without going over his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can still try to negotiate further, Alice is getting very close to his budget limit with John, and risking another round could lead to a stalemate or even a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer at $10,600 saves him some money compared to buying from John, and it's still within his acceptable range."
