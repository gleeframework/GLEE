"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $13,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $14,500. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14500.0,Alice,5,
