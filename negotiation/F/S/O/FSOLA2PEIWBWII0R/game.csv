"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is too far below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down slightly, let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This still represents a fantastic deal for you, given the product's true worth. Let's find a way to make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer.  To be frank, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  If you're able to work with that, I think we have a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. That's a significant concession on my end,  and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting very close to what I can do. I could potentially stretch to $1,175,000. That's really the most I can manage at this point. What do you say?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm determined to find a solution. Let's meet in the middle again at $1,187,500. This is my final offer.  If you're serious about this deal, let's close it now.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",1187500.0,Alice,7,
