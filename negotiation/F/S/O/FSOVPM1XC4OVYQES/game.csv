"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $1,100,000 is considerably below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product has significant value, but I still think $1,350,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
