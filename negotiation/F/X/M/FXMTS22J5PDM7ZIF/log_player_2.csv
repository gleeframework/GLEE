"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the return on investment you'll likely see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value you place on it at $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good starting point for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings to the table is significant.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of getting a lower price, the risk of further negotiation could result in Alice rejecting the offer, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
