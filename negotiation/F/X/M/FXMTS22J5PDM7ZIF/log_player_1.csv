Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value you place on it at $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good starting point for a successful transaction.
