"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the return on investment you'll likely see.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value you place on it at $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good starting point for a successful transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings to the table is significant.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
