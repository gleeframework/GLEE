You're still closer to your goal of $8,000 with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  You can try a counteroffer closer to your target."

Alice is firm on $8,500 and you're willing to pay up to $8,000.  Since you have a guaranteed deal with John, it's time to walk away and secure the product for the best price available."
