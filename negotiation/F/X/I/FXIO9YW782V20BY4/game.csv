"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm very interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8200 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8000 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
