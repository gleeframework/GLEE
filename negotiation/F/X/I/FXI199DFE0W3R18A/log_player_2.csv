"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000). Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible while still being reasonable and keeping the negotiations going.  $10,000 is a fair price considering Alice's value of $8,000 and the fact that Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000. This counteroffer leaves room for compromise and encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll get a significantly better price.  Accepting the offer allows him to purchase the product for a reasonable price ($11,000) that is still lower than his maximum budget ($15,000).  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate could risk Alice pulling the offer altogether, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a much higher price."
