"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95.  You can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $90 is still a good deal for you. It's lower than what John is offering, and it's within your budget.  Accepting her offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
