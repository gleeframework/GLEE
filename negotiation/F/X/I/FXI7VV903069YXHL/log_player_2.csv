Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're committed to this deal. I'm willing to come down to $82.  This is a good price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $82. While getting the product for $82 from Alice is a decent outcome, you know you can get it for $80 from John. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
