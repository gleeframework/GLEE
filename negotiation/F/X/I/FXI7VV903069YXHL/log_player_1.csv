"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I'm willing to risk losing this deal to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I appreciate that.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd like to earn.  I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $78, but that's really the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept since we're running out of rounds, $78 is still too low for me. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to this deal. I'm willing to come down to $82.  This is a good price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
