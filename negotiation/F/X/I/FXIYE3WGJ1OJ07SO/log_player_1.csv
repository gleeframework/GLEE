"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a good price for myself.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable negotiating.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm leaving some room for negotiation, knowing Bob will likely counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, I can likely get a better price with further negotiation. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I want to see if I can close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price that is still above Bob's offer but closer to my desired value. This will allow for continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both room to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product and the fairness of the price.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging Bob to continue negotiations.
* **Maintain My Minimum:**  This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell for less than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a little outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750?  This would be a fair compromise and get us both closer to our goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only six rounds left, I need to be strategic.  I'm not ready to give up yet, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much time and potentially missing out on a better deal.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $10,900. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting this as my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to reach a decision.
* **Compromise:**  I'm making a slight concession, showing my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, suggesting it's a good deal for both parties. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a quick resolution.
* **Above Minimum:** This counteroffer is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm getting closer to accepting Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  Would you consider $10,800?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big impact for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We are at a stalemate. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm reaching my limit with the number of rounds remaining.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only four rounds left, I need to make a decision quickly.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's not profitable for me.
* **John's Offer:** John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John provides a secure and profitable outcome.

**Conclusion:**  While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob, it's more prudent at this stage to sell to John and secure a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
