{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than Alice's asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both room to be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a little outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750?  This would be a fair compromise and get us both closer to our goals."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  Would you consider $10,800?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big impact for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
