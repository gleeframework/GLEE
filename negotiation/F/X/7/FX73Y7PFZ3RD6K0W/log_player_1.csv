"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to ensure I get a good return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $10,750 is a good deal and  closer to my target than John's offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
