"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a meeting point.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's a fair compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,750. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get closer to my price.  While I appreciate your efforts, $9,750 is still a little too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,000. It's fair for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you consider going down to $10,250? It's a compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.",10250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's settle on $10,125. It's a small step for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on that.  What do you say?",10125.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're close to your desired price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9,900. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9900.0,Bob,10,
