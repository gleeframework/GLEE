"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $12,000 is a good starting point that allows for multiple rounds of negotiation without dropping below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the potential benefit to Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.
* **Time and Rounds:**  We're early in the negotiation process, and I have 9 more rounds to potentially reach a more favorable outcome.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to bridge the gap and secure a higher price in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a meeting point."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, showing Bob that I'm serious about a deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's a fair compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's settle on $10,125. It's a small step for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on that.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're close to your desired price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9,900. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Round:** This is the final round of negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Time Pressure:** While Bob is mentioning John as an alternative, it's a bluff because John is willing to pay more than Bob.
* **Selling to John is Optimal:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a significantly higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.

Although it's disappointing to not reach an agreement with Bob, selling to John is the best strategic choice to maximize my profit."
