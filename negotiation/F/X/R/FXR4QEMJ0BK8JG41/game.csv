"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $17,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $16,000?  That gives us both a good deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $15,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the purchase.",15500.0,Bob,4,
