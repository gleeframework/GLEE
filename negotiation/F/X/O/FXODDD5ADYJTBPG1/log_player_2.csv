"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for you, Bob. Here's why:

* **You save money:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly cheaper than buying from John.
* **The product has value to you:** Even though you don't know the exact value, you're willing to spend up to $15,000, so $12,000 is a reasonable price."
