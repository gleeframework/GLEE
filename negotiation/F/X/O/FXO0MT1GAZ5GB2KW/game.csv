"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,100,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  While $1,600,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand where you're coming from, and I value the opportunity to do business with you. To be completely transparent, $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need you to meet me partway. Would you be willing to consider $1,875,000?",1875000.0,Alice,5,
