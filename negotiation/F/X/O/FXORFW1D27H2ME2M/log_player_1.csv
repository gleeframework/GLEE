"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm starting with my ideal price. While I know it's unlikely Bob will accept right away, it establishes my baseline and gives me room to negotiate."

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm not eager to walk away, it's worth exploring if we can find a middle ground.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While Bob's offer is slightly better, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him, but if he doesn't budge significantly, I'll consider selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price to $1,050,000.  This is getting closer to Bob's valuation, but still gives me a bit of profit margin.  If he rejects this, I'm seriously considering selling to John."

I'm still holding out for a better price. We're getting close, but I'm not convinced Bob won't go higher yet. I'll make another counteroffer."
