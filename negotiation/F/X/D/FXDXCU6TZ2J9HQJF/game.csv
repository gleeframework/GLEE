"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is a fair price that allows me to make a small profit while still giving you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,5,
