"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $8,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and knows he has a backup option at $12,000.  By rejecting, he can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows a strong willingness to negotiate and puts pressure on Alice to consider a lower price.  $6,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is a better price than Alice's first offer, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer. Bob has 7 rounds left and should continue to negotiate. He can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility while still maintaining his desired price point. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $7,200 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, and with only 5 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  Bob should accept this offer. While he might be able to get a slightly lower price with more rounds, the risk of not finding an acceptable price and having to buy from John at $12,000 is too high."
