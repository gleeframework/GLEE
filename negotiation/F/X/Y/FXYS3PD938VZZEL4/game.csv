"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a significant discount from what the product is worth to me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500 as a final compromise. If we can't agree on a price that works for both of us, I might need to explore other options. ",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away from this deal, but I'm still willing to make one more offer. I can do $10,800, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear your urgency, but $10,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,200. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.  It's your call, but if we don't find a middle ground soon, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to walk away and explore other options.",10900.0,Bob,8,
