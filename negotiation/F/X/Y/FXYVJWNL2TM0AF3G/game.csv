"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $13,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm firm on $13,500.  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
