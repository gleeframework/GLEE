"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started while leaving space for potential concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not yet ready to settle for such a low price, especially with John waiting in the wings.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Message:**  I reiterate my understanding of Bob's perspective but emphasize that $9,000 is a fair compromise. 

This strategy aims to gradually close the gap while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose $8,500 as a fair price. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough.  I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss at this point, and John's offer remains a strong alternative. I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and attempt another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant compromise on my part and represents a good deal for you.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I emphasize the compromise I'm making and the fairness of the offer. I also use positive language to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

This strategy aims to gradually close the gap and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your last offer and am willing to meet you halfway between our prices. Therefore, I propose $9,000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement from his previous offers and is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, accepting this offer is still a good outcome considering the limited rounds remaining and the possibility of John's offer. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
