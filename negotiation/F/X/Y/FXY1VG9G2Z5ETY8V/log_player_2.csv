You can get a better deal than $9,500, so it's worth rejecting and seeing what counteroffers Alice makes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, so I'm going to offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.

```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price, Bob. I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $9,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me at $9,000, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is your last round of negotiation with Alice. It seems she's firm on $9,000, which is still a good deal for you, as it's within your budget and lower than John's price. It's best to accept the offer and secure the product."
