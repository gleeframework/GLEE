Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 represents a reasonable markup that Bob might be willing to pay to avoid missing out on the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is my initial offer, starting slightly higher leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
