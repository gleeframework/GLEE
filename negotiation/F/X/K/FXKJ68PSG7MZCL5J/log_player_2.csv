"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its intrinsic worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While the product holds significant value at $1,150,000, I'm willing to adjust to meet you closer to your budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This allows me to acknowledge your perspective while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price.  There's still a chance Alice might come down further to meet Bob's target price."

This represents a significant step towards your price and would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this gap."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground. To be decisive and close this deal quickly, I'm willing to accept $1,090,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you, as I need to explore other options if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,090,000 is still within Bob's budget, even though it's a bit higher than his ideal price.  Since Alice is firm on this price and Bob has already rejected her previous offer, it's likely she won't go lower. Accepting this offer saves Bob the time and effort of further negotiation, and avoids the risk of Alice selling to someone else.  The difference between $1,000,000 and $1,090,000 is relatively small compared to the potential gains of securing the product."
