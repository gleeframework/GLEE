"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $12000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a great product, but $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to continue working with you on this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I'm still a bit hesitant about $10500. How about we settle on $9500?  This feels like a fair price that allows us both to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $9500 is getting closer.  However, I'm still at a point where I need to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is a significant compromise on my end. If you're truly serious about this, this is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
