"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $115, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still too low for me. How about $110? It's a fair price, and it gives us both something to be happy about.",110.0,Alice,5,
