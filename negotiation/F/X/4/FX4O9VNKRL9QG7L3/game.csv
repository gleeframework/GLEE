"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and would be a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $12,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
