"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better. He's aiming to save as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation with Alice.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate his own counteroffer and try to get closer to his $800,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant price drop.  $850,000 is still above his ideal price but leaves room for further negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in acquiring the product while also showing his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is only $75,000 above Bob's target price of $800,000.  Considering Bob has limited rounds and John is always a viable alternative, accepting this offer is a smart move. It saves Bob significant money compared to buying from John and gives him a good deal on the product."
