"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This price reflects the unique value proposition I'm offering. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to try and find a solution.  While I'm motivated to sell, I must be realistic about the product's value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and a great opportunity for you.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your continued efforts, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I'm approaching my budget limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
