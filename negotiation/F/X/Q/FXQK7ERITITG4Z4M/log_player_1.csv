"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price point. I believe that I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next rounds. Selling to John for $800,000 would be a last resort if I'm unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However,  $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $900,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is closer but I'm still aiming for $875,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum of $800,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that the deal could fall through. I want to be sure to maximize my profit while still having a backup plan in place."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $887,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}
