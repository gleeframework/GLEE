"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It leaves little room for negotiation and is close to John's price. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do see the value in the product, $11,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still above her perceived value of the product ($8,000). This gives us room to negotiate upwards while aiming for a price well below John's $12,000 offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a budget constraint, we provide a reason for our counteroffer without revealing our absolute maximum price.

The goal is to gauge Alice's flexibility and move the negotiation closer to a price point favorable to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but $10,000 is still too close to John's price. We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price without stalling the negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to a price we're willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle on $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer ($9,000) and Alice's current offer ($10,000), demonstrating a willingness to compromise but also holding firm on a lower price point. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating we're ""ready to close,"" we add a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to accept this potentially final offer from our side. 

We're still aiming for a price well below John's offer while leaving a small margin for a potential final round of negotiation if necessary."
