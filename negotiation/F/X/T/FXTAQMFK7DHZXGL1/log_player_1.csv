Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Here's how:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting near the upper end of the ZOPA, maximizing your potential gain.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're framing it as a ""fair offer"" based on the product's ""unique value and potential.""
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" subtly suggests there might be some room for negotiation if Bob pushes back.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower within the ZOPA. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a price closer to the middle of the ZOPA.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially adjust your price slightly to secure the deal, as long as you stay above your minimum."
