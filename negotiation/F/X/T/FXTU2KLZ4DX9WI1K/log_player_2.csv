``` 

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to, but it's worth a few rounds of negotiation before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This gives us a good starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

Alice is coming down, but I still think we can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but staying below Alice's counteroffer. This shows I'm serious about buying, but still want a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $930,000, which is getting closer to my ideal price. At this point, it's risky to keep rejecting offers.  We've gone through several rounds, and it's possible Alice will become less willing to negotiate further.  It's time to secure the purchase and save some money."
