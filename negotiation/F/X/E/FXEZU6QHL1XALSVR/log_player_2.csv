"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,000 and $6,500, which would be $6,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $6,250. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling or Alice backing out.
