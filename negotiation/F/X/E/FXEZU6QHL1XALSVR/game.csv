"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $6,200. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",6200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $6,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $5,800. Would that work for you?",5800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $5,800, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $6,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",6500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect that. How about we settle at $6,000? That's a fair compromise.",6000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,000 and $6,500, which would be $6,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",6250.0,Alice,7,
