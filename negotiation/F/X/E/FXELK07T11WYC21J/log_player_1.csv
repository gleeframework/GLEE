{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $115, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You're capturing a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product.
* **Staying Competitive:** While leaving some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal ($5 off his perceived value).
* **Above Your Minimum:** Ensuring you make more than your backup offer from John."
