Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial price, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to his $10,000 limit."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's final offer of $14,000 is still above his budget, and he's already stated his final offer. It's in his best interest to move on to a seller who can meet his price."
