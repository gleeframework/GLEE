Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $8,000. The product is worth more than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $8,500 is a slight improvement, I'm still not comfortable selling below my minimum price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go below $9,000.  I'm willing to compromise by offering a final price of $9,250. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I still want to try to reach at least $9,000.  With several rounds left, I believe I can continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  While I understand your budget, $9,000 is my absolute lowest offer.  It's still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. Given my budget constraints, could you consider $8,875 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $8,875 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I've reached a point where I'm not sure I can convince Bob to go any higher. With only two rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $10,000, which is my minimum target.  It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk losing out on a better deal."
