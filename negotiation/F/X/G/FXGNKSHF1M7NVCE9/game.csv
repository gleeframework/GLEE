"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $98?  That's a fair bit closer to my budget.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $98 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $102? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",102.0,Alice,5,
