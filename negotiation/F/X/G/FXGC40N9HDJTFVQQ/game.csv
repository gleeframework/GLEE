"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $115? It's a fair price that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",115.0,Alice,3,
