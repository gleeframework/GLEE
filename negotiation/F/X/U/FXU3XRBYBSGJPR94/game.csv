"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you a significant profit. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so please consider my offer.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's reach a final agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
