"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a range that Alice might be willing to accept, considering she values the product at $1,200,000. This gives Bob a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than what Bob can get from John.  It's worth accepting this offer as it's still within Bob's budget and secures the product without further negotiation. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even a higher price from Alice."
