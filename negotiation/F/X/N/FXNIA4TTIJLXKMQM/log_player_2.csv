"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to us, I propose a price of $10000 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $8000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my budget, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I'd like to offer the product at $9000. This is a fair compromise between our respective positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of a lower price open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm still sticking to my budget. I'm happy to pay $8,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your latest offer and am willing to move forward with a price of $9250. This reflects a balance between the value you see in the product and the cost I can afford to sell it for. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Even though there are still rounds left, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to budge significantly. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at a guaranteed price of $8,000.  There's no guarantee that Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice, and the risk of exceeding his budget is too high."
