"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm ready to offer you $12,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a bit more.  How about $13,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little too high for me. How about $13,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
