"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $12,000 is a bit low for me considering the product's condition and value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit for me.",13500.0,Alice,3,
