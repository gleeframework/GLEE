Round 4

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to our desired price, we're still in early rounds.  We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if we don't get a price that reflects the product's worth. John's offer provides a safety net, but we can likely negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't justify going below $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer shows Bob we're serious about the $1,100,000 mark.  We're not drastically changing our price, demonstrating a willingness to be reasonable.
* **Finality:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative:** We're still above John's offer, giving us room to walk away if Bob doesn't meet our price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,095,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm counting on you to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $5,000 below our ""final offer"" and a significant amount above John's offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments and risks pushing Bob away entirely. 
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point in the rounds. Securing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob walking away later, forcing us to accept John's lower offer."
