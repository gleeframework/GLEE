"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $100 max
* **Value to Alice:** $80
* **Alice's Offer:** $90

Bob can likely get a better deal than $90. It's worth exploring a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but I'm looking to spend closer to $85.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings, get the product for as close to $80 as possible.
* **Alice's Value:** $80
* **Counteroffer:** $85 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $85, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $87.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $100 max
* **Value to Alice:** $80
* **Alice's Offer:** $87.50

While this is a better deal than her first offer, Bob can still likely negotiate further. He's already shown a willingness to pay closer to $85, and there's still room to maneuver before needing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I'm really interested,  $87.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $86?  I think that's a fair compromise, and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Get as close to $80 as possible.
* **Alice's Value:** $80 
* **Counteroffer:** $86 is a small step closer to Alice's value, but still leaves a small margin for potential negotiation. It's a reasonable offer that shows Bob's willingness to compromise, while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $86. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $88.25. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $100 max
* **Value to Alice:** $80
* **Alice's Offer:** $88.25

Although this is a slight improvement from her previous offer, Bob is still better off trying to negotiate further. He's shown a willingness to go as low as $86, and Alice has shown flexibility.  It's worth seeing if a compromise can be reached in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $87,  but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Get as close to $80 as possible, but also be prepared to pay a bit more if it means closing the deal.
* **Alice's Value:** $80
* **Counteroffer:** $87 is a small step closer to Alice's offer, but it's important for Bob to signal this is his final offer. By stating it clearly, Bob creates pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale. This is a tactic to try and push Alice towards her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $87. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer the product to you for $88.50. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $100 max
* **Value to Alice:** $80
* **Alice's Offer:** $88.50

Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.  While $88.50 isn't Bob's ideal price, it's still a significant savings over John's offer, and the risk of walking away with nothing is too high."
