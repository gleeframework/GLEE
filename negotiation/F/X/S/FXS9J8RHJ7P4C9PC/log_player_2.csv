Alice is offering a good price, but there's room to negotiate and save more. It's worth trying to get a lower price before considering buying from John."

Alice's counteroffer is better than her first, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price.  I'll counter again and see if we can meet in the middle."

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good price considering the starting point.  I'm happy with this deal and it's much better than buying from John."
