Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's worth to Bob emphasizes the potential bargain for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while maintaining a strong opening position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I have to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $8,500 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him to increase his offer.  
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:**  In the next round, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise. 

This decision allows me to keep exploring the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob, without immediately settling for a lower profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would still allow me to get a reasonable price and get this product in your hands. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer is a halfway point between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $9,250 is still well above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message again highlights the product's worth and reinforces the potential bargain for Bob.

This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually acceptable price, while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  $9,000 is only $250 less than my previous counter-offer, which is a small difference.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good profit and potentially opens the door for future deals with Bob.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to further negotiation, but it also increases the chance that he might walk away entirely.

While a slightly higher price would be ideal,  accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
