Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $22,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $12,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I'm willing to compromise, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we land at $14,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your patience. I understand this product is valuable, but I have a strict budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $14,000, Bob has stated this is his final offer. Accepting $13,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum ($15,000 value to me - $13,000 offer = $2,000 profit).  Continuing to negotiate risks him walking away entirely, leaving me to take John's offer at $15,000."
