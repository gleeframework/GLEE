"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $22,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I'm willing to compromise, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we land at $14,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience. I understand this product is valuable, but I have a strict budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? This is my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
