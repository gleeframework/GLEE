"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for someone with your expertise. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially valuing it at $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this product has the potential to exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you establish a strong anchor. This gives you more negotiating room.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, vaguely mentioning the product's ""unique nature"" and ""potential"" provides some justification without revealing specific details.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language implies a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in multi-round bargaining. 

The goal is to gauge Bob's initial reaction and understand how far apart your valuations truly are."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, the price point is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to be fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

While selling to John is always an option, it's too early to settle for your backup plan.  You have plenty of rounds left to try and reach a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000, which I believe is still a very reasonable price considering its potential to benefit your business.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** You're making a significant concession from your initial price to signal flexibility.  However, you're still well above both your floor and Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** You're reiterating the product's potential benefits to Bob, subtly reminding him of the value it holds for him specifically. 
* **Encouraging Response:** You're directly asking for Bob's thoughts to keep the negotiation moving and gauge his reaction to this counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still aiming for a price closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. To meet somewhere in the middle, I could go up to $1,100,000.  This offer reflects the serious interest I have in acquiring the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum price, but it's still below your guaranteed sale to John. You have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal. 

Here's why:

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has increased his offer substantially. This indicates potential for reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time Remaining:**  You're only on Round 4 of 10. You have time to counter and see how high Bob is willing to go.
* **John as Leverage:**  You know you have John's offer as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable.

Let's see if we can push Bob a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the value of this product. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I value the potential synergy our partnership could bring. To close the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer at a higher price, you introduce a sense of competition and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** You're making a smaller concession this round,  showing you're serious about your price while still being open to negotiation.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** While you can technically continue negotiating, stating this is your final offer adds weight to your proposal. It might incentivize Bob to make a more serious offer if he's truly interested. 

This strategy aims to push Bob closer to your target price while still keeping the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, and I understand your position with other potential buyers. To be completely upfront, $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can justify for this acquisition. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now explicitly stated his absolute maximum price, which is significantly below your minimum and your guaranteed offer from John.

Here's why it's time to walk away:

* **No More Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's use of ""absolute maximum"" and mentioning ""other options"" signals he's unlikely to move further.
* **Time vs. Potential Gain:** You've used half your rounds and aren't much closer to an agreeable price. Continuing risks losing John's offer without a guarantee of Bob agreeing to a better price. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a sure $1,500,000, which is a substantial profit compared to the risk of continuing with Bob. 

While it's tempting to try and squeeze more out of the deal, Bob's firm stance suggests it's time to take the guaranteed win and sell to John."
