"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my needs. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000? That's still a fair price for the value of the product, and it would make this deal more attractive to me."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go down to $13,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $13,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $200 lower than John's price:** This represents a significant savings for Bob.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying John's full price. 
* **The product is still valuable to Bob:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he's still getting a good deal at $13,800.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price and minimize risk."
