Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $140 is a good balance:
    * It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($100), giving me room to negotiate if needed.
    * It's still a price that might be tempting for Bob if he sees the value in the product.

By starting high, I leave room to potentially lower the price slightly and still make a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
