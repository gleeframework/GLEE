"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest in the product, $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,250, which would be $9,125. Can you consider that?",9125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I'm happy to work with you, $9,125 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,150, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",9150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  How about we meet at $9,175?  I know this isn't a huge jump, but it's a small compromise that could bring us to a deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.",9175.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,150 and $9,175, which would be $9,162.50. Can you consider that?",9162.5,Bob,8,
