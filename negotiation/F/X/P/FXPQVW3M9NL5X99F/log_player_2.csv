{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,500 is a good deal, it's still worth exploring if I can get an even better price. There are still 9 rounds left, and I can always buy from John as a fallback option."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her previous offer, but it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push her further down. I still have 7 rounds left, so I can afford to keep negotiating."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but I still believe I can get a slightly better deal. I have 3 rounds left, and I'm willing to risk pushing for a lower price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal within my budget."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is very close to my limit, but I'm not willing to pay that much. It's better for me to buy from John at $8,000 than to risk another round and potentially end up paying more. With only one round left, I need to secure the product and avoid the possibility of Alice increasing her price further."
