**Reasoning:**

While still below your ideal price, $950,000 is a reasonable offer at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Value:**  You've already spent 6 rounds negotiating, and time is money.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire to purchase. 
* **Profitable Sale:** Even at $950,000, you're making a significant profit over Bob's perceived value.

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and you risk losing the sale altogether if you push too hard. Accepting $950,000 ensures a solid profit and a quicker, less stressful transaction."
