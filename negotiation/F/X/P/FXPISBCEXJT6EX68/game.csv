"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this revised offer bridges the gap while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000,  which reflects a fair price for both of us.  I believe this demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually agreeable deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. While I'm committed to reaching an agreement, $900,000 remains significantly below my bottom line.  I can go down to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise considering the product's value.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $975,000 is closer, it's still just above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
