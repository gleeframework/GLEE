"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can we meet in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $950,000, so how about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 just isn't enough for me to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $925,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is really my final offer, and I'm sure it's a good price for both of us. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $925,000, so how about $912,500?",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $912,500 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $920,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for both of us and it keeps the deal moving forward.  Let me know what you think.",920000.0,Alice,7,
