"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still higher than Bob's estimated value of $800,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 9 more rounds to reach a deal, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $950,000, so how about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is still too low for me. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I know I can get a better price, or even sell to John for $1,200,000.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm keeping John in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 just isn't enough for me to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $925,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is really my final offer, and I'm sure it's a good price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $925,000, so how about $912,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $912,500 is still below my minimum. I'm not willing to give up that much for a deal that leaves me with less than I want. It's getting risky, but I'm going to keep negotiating, aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  If I can't get there, I'll still have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $912,500 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $920,000 as a final compromise.

Round 8

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, Bob is still holding out for a price below my minimum. I'm not going to risk another round and get stuck with a price that's too low. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome."
