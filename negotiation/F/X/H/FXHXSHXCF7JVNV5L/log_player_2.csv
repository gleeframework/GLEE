"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget. He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is the highest I can go.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm offering you the product for $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. It's better to keep negotiating and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $9,500.  Would you be willing to consider that offer?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $12000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still above his $8,000 limit. He should try to negotiate further and aim for a lower price.  It's also worth noting that he can always buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I truly appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to getting this product, but $10,000 is my absolute maximum.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer for this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's desired price point, and he's only got 3 rounds left.  John is offering a price that's within Bob's budget, and it's less risky to go with a guaranteed deal."
