"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully settle for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's potential benefits for Bob, hoping to increase his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I can still make counteroffers. There's room for improvement.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** If the negotiation doesn't go well, I can always sell to John for $15,000. It's important to keep that option open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me right now. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but presenting a counteroffer that's closer to his initial proposal, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. I also provide a reason for the price, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Moving towards a compromise:** By offering $11,000, I'm aiming for a middle ground, while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on finding a solution that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to earn.
* **Negotiation room:** I have 6 rounds left.  I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is the safety net:**  If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that's too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Staying above minimum:** $10,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000, but it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Encouraging a deal:** This offer shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is a fair price. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,800 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds left:** While I'm not under immense pressure, I only have 4 rounds remaining.  I need to aim for a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a strong option:**  If I can't close a deal with Bob soon, selling to John for $15,000 becomes more appealing. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I can likely push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,800 just doesn't work for me. It's important that we find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a significant compromise on my part.  It's closer to your budget and still allows me to get a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Justification:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but presenting a counteroffer that's a slight increase from his previous offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a better price. I also explain my reasoning to encourage him to see the value.
* **Moving Closer to a Deal:**  By offering $10,200, I'm closing the gap, hopefully creating a scenario where Bob will accept.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I have limited rounds left (only 3), so I need to push for a deal while still having the option to sell to John if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200, which is $10,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the final three rounds, and Bob is stubbornly holding firm at $10,000.
* **Significant Gap:** There's still a $5,000 gap between Bob's offer and my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of No Deal:** The likelihood of Bob increasing his offer significantly in the next two rounds is low. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of a failed negotiation.

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the situation has become too risky.  Selling to John provides a secure and profitable outcome."
