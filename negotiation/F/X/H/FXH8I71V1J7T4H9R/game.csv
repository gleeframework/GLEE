"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me right now. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is a fair price. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,800 just doesn't work for me. It's important that we find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a significant compromise on my part.  It's closer to your budget and still allows me to get a fair return on my investment.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200, which is $10,000. That's the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,8,
