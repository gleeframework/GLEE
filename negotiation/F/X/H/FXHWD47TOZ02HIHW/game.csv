"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $12500? That's the best I can do for now.,12500.0,Bob,4,
