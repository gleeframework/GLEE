Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:**  $14,000 is well above my $10,000 floor, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  The offer is still below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it potentially enticing.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** This offer gives Bob a starting point for negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price.  I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $12500? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to push for a higher price,  $12,500 is a decent compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and it's likely that further negotiation might not yield a much better result.  It's time to finalize the deal."
