"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $600000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $750000. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $800000?  This would allow me to close the deal and you'd still be getting a great value for the product.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
