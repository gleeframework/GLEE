"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Opening Offer:**  Starting high allows for room to negotiate downwards without feeling like you're giving away too much.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning ""significant value"" implies the product's worth without directly disclosing your own valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly conveys that you're willing to discuss the price, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. Your strategy in subsequent rounds will depend on Bob's response and your assessment of his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This gives me hope for a better counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Accepting his offer now would mean losing out on potentially earning more. Rejecting allows me to maintain my leverage and try to push for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer. It's important to consider Bob's budget constraint while trying to get as close to my minimum value as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $600,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering a price halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer shows good faith and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Framing the Deal Positively:** Highlighting the ""good deal"" for both parties makes the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** $850,000 is still above my minimum, leaving room to negotiate if necessary.

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer that is more appealing than Bob's but still above my minimum, I aim to strike a balance between earning a decent profit and closing the deal.  This strategy will depend on Bob's response and my assessment of his willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $750000. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic and avoid settling too early.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating the possibility of him increasing his offer further. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price point.  I'll need to carefully consider Bob's budget constraints and the limited time remaining."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $800,000?  This would allow me to close the deal and you'd still be getting a great value for the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer (for now):** This is my final offer for this round, as it aligns with my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the ""great value"" Bob would get at this price, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  The message suggests a sense of urgency and finality, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

By sticking to my minimum price, I hope to get a quick agreement. However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess the situation and consider whether to accept John's offer in the next round.  I'm running out of time, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob."
