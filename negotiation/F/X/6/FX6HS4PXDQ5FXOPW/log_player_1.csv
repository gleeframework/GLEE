Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to own it."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible, knowing that's the guaranteed price from John.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high anchors the negotiation. Even if Bob counters, it's unlikely to go much below $15,000.
* **Sense of Urgency (Implied):**  By not revealing John's offer, there's a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact valuation of $8,000. If she did, she could try for a price closer to that amount."
