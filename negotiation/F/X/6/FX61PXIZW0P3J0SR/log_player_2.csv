"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200001. This is a fair price, considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $1 more than the price you can get from John.  There's no reason to accept this offer. Since it's only $1 more, it's worth trying to see if Alice is willing to negotiate down to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,001 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1100000 is a bit below your minimum, Bob. However, I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1200000. This price is still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now the same price as John's. There's no advantage to continuing the negotiation with Alice, and there's a risk that she could reject a counteroffer, forcing you to accept a higher price. It's better to go with the certainty of John's offer."
