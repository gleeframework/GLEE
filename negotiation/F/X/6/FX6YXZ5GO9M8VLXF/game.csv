"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I believe it has even greater potential in your hands.  I'm starting at a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price would give us both a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage and allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,250,000?  This would allow you to make a profit and still be a good deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,250,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen.  This is my final offer.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
