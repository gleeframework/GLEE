{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I believe it has even greater potential in your hands.  I'm starting at a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price would give us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage and allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,250,000?  This would allow you to make a profit and still be a good deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is still not enough to meet my minimum target.  I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,250,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
