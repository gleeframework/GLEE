I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both of us, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant gain.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is insulting! He's only offering a dollar more than the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm not going to settle for that.  I'll counteroffer and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm still aiming for a profit, but I'm lowering the price to show some flexibility.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a good opportunity to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm worried that if I reject this offer, we might not be able to close the deal.  This is a good deal for me, and I'd rather take the profit now than risk losing the sale altogether."
