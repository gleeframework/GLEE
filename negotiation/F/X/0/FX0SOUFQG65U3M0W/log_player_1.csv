{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up. Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still being a potentially attractive deal for Bob, saving him $100,000 compared to my alternative offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another offer creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Confidence:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and make the offer more appealing."
