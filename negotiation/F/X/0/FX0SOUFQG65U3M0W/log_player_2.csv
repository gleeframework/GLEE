"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up. Let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message uses persuasive language, the bottom line is the price.  $1,100,000 is significantly higher than your $800,000 maximum and the guaranteed $800,000 offer from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John and save $300,000."
