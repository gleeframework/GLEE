Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,100,000.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at my maximum budget."
