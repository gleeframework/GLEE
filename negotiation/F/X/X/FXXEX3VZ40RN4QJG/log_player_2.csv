Alice's offer is way too high.  It's better to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm going to start with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down."

I'll offer $1,250,000. This is closer to my maximum budget and hopefully signals my serious intent to buy while still leaving some room for negotiation."
