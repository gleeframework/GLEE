"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  How about $800,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. ",800000.0,Alice,3,
