"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $775,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a more substantial discount. Would you consider $700,000? I feel this is a fair offer considering the potential for a quick and mutually beneficial deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
