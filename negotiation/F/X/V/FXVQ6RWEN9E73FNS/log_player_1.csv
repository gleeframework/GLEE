``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price above Bob's valuation but still potentially attractive enough for him to consider. If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer and the risk of losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000 and even below his own valuation of $10,000. I will counteroffer to try and find a more agreeable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  Although it is closer to my previous offer, I believe I can still get a higher price. I will counteroffer again."
