Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" you subtly create a sense of demand and justify the higher price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is suggestive, not demanding. This gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer without feeling pressured.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be very price-sensitive, you might want to lower your initial offer slightly.
* **Market Conditions:** If the market for this type of product is hot, you could potentially go even higher with your initial offer."
