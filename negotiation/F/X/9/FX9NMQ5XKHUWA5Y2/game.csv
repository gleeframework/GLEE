"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still very interested in the product, but I really need to keep costs down. I'd be willing to meet you at $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
