"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the win-win potential of the deal, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By setting the price at $1 million, I've established a starting point and anticipate a counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my best offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better deal.
* **Room for Counteroffers:** Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially increase the final price. 
* **Exploring All Options:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still trying to secure a price closer to my minimum.
* **Middle Ground:**  Splitting the difference shows a willingness to be flexible and meet halfway.
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting the ""good deal"" for both parties can be persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to see if he's willing to go higher. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John at $1,200,000 is a safe option, but I don't want to settle for less if there's a chance to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $935,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate, but not giving away too much.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer brings us closer to an agreement and creates a sense of urgency.
* **Final Offer?:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and suggesting it could be a final offer, putting the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a loss for me.
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  Bob has declared this his final offer, implying he won't budge further. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in Round 6, and I need to secure a deal soon.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and a significant profit.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely."
