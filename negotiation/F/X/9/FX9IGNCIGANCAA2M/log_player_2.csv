"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $110, which is still within Bob's budget of $150.**
* **Bob has already rejected a $100 offer and Alice countered with $110.**  It's likely that further negotiation won't bring the price down much further. 
* **Bob has 7 rounds remaining**, so there's still time to find a better deal if he rejects this offer. However, it's possible Alice will raise her price in subsequent rounds. 
* **Buying from John for $150 is a worse deal than accepting Alice's current offer.**

This is a calculated risk, as Bob is potentially leaving some money on the table. However, the risk of Alice raising the price or the negotiation dragging on for too long is higher than the potential benefit of getting a slightly lower price."
