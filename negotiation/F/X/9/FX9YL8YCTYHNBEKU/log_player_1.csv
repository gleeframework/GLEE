Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a profit above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is still a good profit for me.  It's above my minimum value and I don't want to risk him walking away completely or me having to settle with John for $1,500,000."
