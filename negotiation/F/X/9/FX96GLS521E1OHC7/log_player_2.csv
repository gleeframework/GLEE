"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than what John is selling it for, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $8,500 is a little lower than I'd like to go. How about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $9,000 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get the price down closer to his ideal target."
