{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price of $800,000.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm determined to get the product for closer to $800,000 and will continue to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $920,000 is still a bit outside my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $890,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $890,000, which is $905,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm offering.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $905,000 is still too high. We only have a few rounds left, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John, so I'll buy the product from him for $800,000."
