"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your perspective on the market,  $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still reflects a significant discount from my initial price and a fair value given the unique attributes of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950,000 is closer,  it's still below the value I'm seeking.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair balance between our interests.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
