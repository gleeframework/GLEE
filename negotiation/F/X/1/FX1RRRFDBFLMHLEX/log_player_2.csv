"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try negotiating with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's worth exploring if you can do better with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is to quickly gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a good deal. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on her response in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $1,000,000. It's still worth trying to negotiate further.  If Alice keeps rejecting my offers, I can always choose to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, while still remaining below her most recent offer.  I'm hoping this will tempt her to accept, especially since I'm getting closer to her price range. If she rejects again, I might need to reconsider my strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,100,000, it's still slightly above my budget. I believe there's still room for negotiation.  If I reject this offer, I can counteroffer again and potentially get a lower price.  Buying from John is still an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $1,075,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal, and I'm confident that this offer is reasonable, considering the ongoing negotiation and my willingness to pay more than my initial offer.  I hope this offer will entice Alice to accept and avoid further rounds.  If she rejects, I'll need to seriously consider buying from John as my time is running out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is now within my budget and is getting very close to my initial target of $1,000,000.  I'm running out of time, and accepting this offer ensures I get the product. I can't risk going through more rounds and ending up with John's price or having to walk away without the product.  It's a good compromise, given the circumstances."
