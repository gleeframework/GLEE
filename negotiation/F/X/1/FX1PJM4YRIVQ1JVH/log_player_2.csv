"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum price and what John offers. You can save $1,000 by going with John."
