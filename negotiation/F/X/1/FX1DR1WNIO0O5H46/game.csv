"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the price down to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the $1,200,000 value you mentioned earlier. Let's try $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
