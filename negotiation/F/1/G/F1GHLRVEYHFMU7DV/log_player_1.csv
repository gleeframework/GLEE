Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $14,999. I know it's a great deal for something of this quality, so let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 
 
This strategy aims to:
* **Maximize profit:**  By starting high, Alice leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Maintain attractiveness:** Presenting the offer as a ""steal"" and highlighting the ""quality"" aims to create a sense of urgency and value.
* **Secure a quick sale (potentially):**  There's a chance Bob might accept the high price if he's convinced by the framing. This avoids potential delays from negotiation or having to sell to John. 

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared for Bob to reject this initial offer. If he does, she can then decide whether to negotiate or simply sell to John for her guaranteed $15,000."
