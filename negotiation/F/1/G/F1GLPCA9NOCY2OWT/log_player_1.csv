Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000,  selling to Bob at a slightly lower price might be more advantageous. This avoids potential delays or complications associated with waiting for John to complete the purchase.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a potential discount compared to John's offer. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
