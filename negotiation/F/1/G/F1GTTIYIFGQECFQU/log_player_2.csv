"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is my maximum, I want to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the initial offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this encourages Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $100 to $90, which is a good compromise.  I can save $10 compared to buying from John, making this a better deal for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject my offer and I could end up paying John $100. Accepting this offer is the safest option to get the product at a decent price."
