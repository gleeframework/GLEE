"I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $10000. I'll sell the product to you for $11250. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  While $11250 is closer, I'm still holding firm at $10000. If this isn't acceptable, I'm ready to go with John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,8,
