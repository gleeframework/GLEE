Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll sell it to you for $670,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Price:**  $670,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is clearly committed to a price above $650,000.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to go with John isn't worth it at this point. 
* **Time is Money:**  Dragging out negotiations can be costly in other ways (opportunity costs, etc.). Accepting now secures a good deal."
