"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is still a good deal for you.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16000 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15000?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
