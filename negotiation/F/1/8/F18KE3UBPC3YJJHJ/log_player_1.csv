"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Testing the Waters:**  By stating ""I think you'd be very interested"", I'm gauging Bob's potential interest without revealing too much about my own valuation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm explicitly inviting Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open and leaving room for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  There's still a $2,000 gap between his offer and my minimum.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **Not Rushing:** Selling to John for $12,000 is my fallback option, but I'm not in a rush to do that.  I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiation:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter-offer that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:** My offer of $16,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I emphasize that my price is ""still a good deal for you"", reminding Bob of the potential value of the product.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I end with ""What do you say?"" to keep the conversation open and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16000 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15000?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is only $1,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $14,000. 
* **Strong Interest:** Bob clearly wants the product and is making an effort to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time is Money:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's getting riskier to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though I'm accepting a price closer to my minimum,  Bob's willingness to negotiate and his interest in the product could lead to potential future deals with him."
