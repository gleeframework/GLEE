"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is far too low. It's below my minimum asking price, and doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product to me. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
