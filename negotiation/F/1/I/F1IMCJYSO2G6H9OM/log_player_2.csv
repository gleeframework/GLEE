``` 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,300,000. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is far too low. It's below my minimum asking price, and doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still try to get a lower price. There are still many rounds left to negotiate, and he has the option to buy from John if he's unsuccessful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product to me. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, Alice has offered the product at Bob's target price of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, and he doesn't need to risk further negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
