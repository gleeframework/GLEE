"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully extract a price closer to my ideal value.  I'm also setting a high bar to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. I hope this shows good faith while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'll reject it and try to counteroffer again, hoping to get a better price. While selling to John is tempting, I think I can still get a better price from Bob with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still higher than my minimum price but shows that I am willing to be flexible. I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating. I have a few more rounds to try to reach a more favorable price. While John's offer is tempting, I think I can get a better deal if I continue with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,550,000, which is still above my minimum.  With only a few rounds left, I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum, and we are down to the last few rounds.  I've tried to negotiate and show flexibility, but it seems like Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price. I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum value for the product."
