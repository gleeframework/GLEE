This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:** $915,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price.
* **Alice is firm:** She's clearly stated this is her final offer. Pushing further might make her back out completely. 
* **Limited rounds:**  You only have a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 

Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of having to settle for John's higher price later."
