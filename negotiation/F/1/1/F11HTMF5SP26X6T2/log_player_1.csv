Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $13,500."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, selling to Bob for a slightly lower price could still be more profitable if Bob accepts. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $13,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob values the product at ($12,000), but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling quickly to Bob, even at a slightly reduced price, avoids the potential delays of finding another buyer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, further negotiation might be necessary to reach a mutually agreeable price."
