"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in purchasing if you could come down to $105. ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm really looking for a deal closer to $110. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to buy.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a compromise at $122.50. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",122.5,Alice,5,
