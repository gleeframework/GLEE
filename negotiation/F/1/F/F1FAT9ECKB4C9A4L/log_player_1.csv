Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,200,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than what I need. I'm still hopeful to get a better deal with Bob, but I will keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiations don't progress as desired."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I'm willing to consider $1,400,000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my desired price, it's a good compromise considering the limited rounds and the potential of selling to John for a slightly higher price. It's more beneficial to close the deal now rather than risk further negotiation rounds that might result in a lower price or a failed negotiation."
