Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price of $10,000.  This is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, but I'm not going to assume he'll accept it immediately. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm not going to undercut my own value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer.  It's still above my minimum value, and I'm hopeful he'll be willing to pay a bit more for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob has come up slightly, his offer is still below my minimum price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially when I have a guaranteed sale to John at my desired price."
