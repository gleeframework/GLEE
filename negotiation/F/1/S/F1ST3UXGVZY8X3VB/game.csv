"Bob, I have a very special product I believe you might be interested in. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right person. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your perspective, but this product is truly unique, and I'm confident it can be even more valuable in your hands.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This would still give you a significant potential for profit, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $900000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's worth it to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. While $900000 is getting closer to what I need,  I'm still not quite there yet.  This product is truly special, and I'm confident it has the potential to be worth more to you than $900000.  How about we settle at $950000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $850000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,6,
