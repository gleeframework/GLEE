"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very special product I believe you might be interested in. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right person. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your perspective, but this product is truly unique, and I'm confident it can be even more valuable in your hands.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This would still give you a significant potential for profit, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.

This product is truly special, and I'm confident it has the potential to be worth more to you than $900000.  How about we settle at $950000?
