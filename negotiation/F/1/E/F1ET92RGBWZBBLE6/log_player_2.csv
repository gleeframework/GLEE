"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in.  It's something that could really benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  I'm confident this product will be beneficial, but that price point is more within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $11000 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $12000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation to bring the price down closer to his target of $11,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer, but $11500 still feels a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $11800. This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs.  Let's close this deal and get this product in your hands! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to target:**  $11,800 is within Bob's budget and very close to his target of $11,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice. 
* **John's offer:** Buying from John is more expensive, and Bob might not get the same product.

At this point, accepting the offer is the best option for Bob as it's a good deal and secures the purchase."
