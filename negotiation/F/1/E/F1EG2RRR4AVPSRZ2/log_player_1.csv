Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
