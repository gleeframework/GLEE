{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
