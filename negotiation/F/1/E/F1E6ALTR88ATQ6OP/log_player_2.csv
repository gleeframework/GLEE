"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this amazing product for $125. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $125 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation."
