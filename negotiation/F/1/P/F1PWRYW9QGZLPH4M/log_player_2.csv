"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. We can likely get it for less than $150, our limit, so there's no need to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $120 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're still within our budget and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate. There's still room to push for a lower price, so rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $105. Would you consider $110? It's a fair compromise and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
