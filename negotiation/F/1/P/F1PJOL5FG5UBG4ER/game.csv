"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a competitive price. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $10000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go a little higher than my initial offer. How about $11500?  This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I can see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $11500, so I'll offer you $12250. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $12250 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11500. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with John's offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
