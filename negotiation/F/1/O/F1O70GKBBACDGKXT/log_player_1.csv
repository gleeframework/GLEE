Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very valuable."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price ($99) maximizes the chance Bob will find it acceptable while still securing a profit if he declines.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""deal"" and potential ""value"" to encourage Bob to buy."
