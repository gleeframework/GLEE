Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise.  $1,300,000 would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet at $1260000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, and I think this price is fair considering the value it will bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and we're running out of rounds. It's likely that he won't budge much more, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of selling to John for a much lower price."
