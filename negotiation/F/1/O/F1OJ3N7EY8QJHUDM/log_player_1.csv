"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I could be persuaded to go down to $105."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on getting this product, but I can't go above $90. If you're willing to come down to that price, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price, it's unlikely he'll go above $90. Selling to John guarantees the $100, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
