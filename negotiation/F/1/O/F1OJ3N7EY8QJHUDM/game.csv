"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I could be persuaded to go down to $105.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on getting this product, but I can't go above $90. If you're willing to come down to that price, we have a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
