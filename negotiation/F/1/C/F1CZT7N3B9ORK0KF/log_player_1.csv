I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I will try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm concerned that we are running out of rounds. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers because I might not be able to get a better price, and I don't want to lose the opportunity to sell to John for my minimum price.  Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $80."
