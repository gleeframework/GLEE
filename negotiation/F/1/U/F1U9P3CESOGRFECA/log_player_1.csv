"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $88? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price of $100, $88 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $80.  This also gives me a higher chance of securing a sale within the allotted 10 rounds."
