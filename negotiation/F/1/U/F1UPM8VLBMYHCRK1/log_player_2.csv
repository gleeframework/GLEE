"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to provide exceptional value. I believe it could greatly benefit you and enhance your experience. For this unique opportunity, I am offering it to you for $85. I hope we can make this transaction happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. Since the product is worth no more than $100 to him, he has room to negotiate.  He can reject the offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality you've described, $85 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $10. This demonstrates he's serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if necessary.  He's hoping Alice will accept this offer, but is prepared for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might better suit your needs. Considering the value and quality of our product, I am willing to offer it to you for $80. I hope this aligns more closely with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but it's still above his target. Bob is likely to continue negotiating. He has the option of John for $100 as a safety net, so he's not under pressure to accept anything above his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $80 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. It's a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 78}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer but still maintaining a lower price point.  He's showing flexibility while still trying to secure the best possible deal.  He's using a small increment in his counteroffer to signal that he's serious about finding a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am glad we're finding common ground. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider $79 for the product. I believe this price reflects both the value of our product and your assessment. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down to $79, which is just $1 above Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's within his budget and closer to his target price.  It's likely that further negotiation would only yield a small decrease in price, and it's not worth risking the deal to save just a few more dollars.  He has the option of John for $100, but this is a better deal."
