Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price close to my desired value but leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth $150 to Bob, so I believe he'll be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a bit hesitant about $135.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $130 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's getting closer to my desired value.  It's a good compromise and I'm happy to accept it."
