"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 You should reject the offer. You want to save as much money as possible, and you are willing to pay no more than $150.  While this is a good first offer, it's still a bit higher than you're comfortable with.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject the offer. You want to save as much money as possible and are willing to pay no more than $150. Although this is a better offer than the first, it's still a bit more than you'd like.  It's worthwhile to see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a bit hesitant about $135.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
