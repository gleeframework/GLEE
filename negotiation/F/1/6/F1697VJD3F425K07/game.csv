"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a bit hesitant about $135.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
