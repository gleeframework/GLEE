"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000?  This price still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's closer to my target.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,080,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this point.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
