Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120, giving me some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money. However, I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a higher price."
