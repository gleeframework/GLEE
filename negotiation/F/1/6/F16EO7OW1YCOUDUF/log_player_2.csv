"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is asking for $9,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price.
* **You have time.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate. 

By rejecting the offer, you can explore a counteroffer that gets you closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value of $8,000. This shows you're serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  You've left some space for Alice to counter, allowing the negotiation to progress.
* **Keeps you within your budget:**  This price is still well within your maximum budget of $12,000.

By offering a lower price, you're increasing the likelihood of a successful deal while still staying within your financial goals."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price:** Her offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than her initial offer of $9,000 and is within a reasonable range of your counteroffer.
* **Time is valuable:**  You've already gone through two rounds of negotiation. It's becoming increasingly likely that further rounds won't yield a much lower price.
* **You're saving money:**  Buying from Alice for $8,500 is significantly cheaper than buying from John for $12,000.

By accepting Alice's offer, you secure the product at a price that saves you money compared to your backup option and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
