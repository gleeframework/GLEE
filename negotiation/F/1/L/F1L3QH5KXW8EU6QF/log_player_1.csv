I'm going to keep trying to get a better price from Bob.  The product is worth $8,000 to him, so there's still room to negotiate."

I'm going to lower the price a bit more, but still aim for a profit.  I'm confident we can reach a deal."

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $6,500.  I'm better off selling to John for $8,000 and guaranteeing my desired profit."
