"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175 as my counteroffer. It's still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This is a good midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough for me to consider selling. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $160.  This is a compromise, acknowledging that I need to be more flexible to reach a deal. However, it's still a good price considering my minimum and the fact that we're now in the middle of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better price from Bob. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially considering we have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $145. We're approaching my minimum, and I need to be more flexible to potentially close this deal. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway at this price."
