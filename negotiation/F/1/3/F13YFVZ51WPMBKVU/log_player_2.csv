(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since buying from John will cost the same as accepting Alice's offer, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer.  There's always the possibility that Alice will lower her price if Bob rejects the initial offer."
