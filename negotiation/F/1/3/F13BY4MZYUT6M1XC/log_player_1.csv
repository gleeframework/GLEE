{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and  potentially make a new one. However, if I feel the negotiation is taking too long or isn't going in my favor, I'll take John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm offering you the product for $10,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is a fair compromise. It's close to my minimum acceptable value, and it's clear he's unlikely to budge further. Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing the sale to another buyer."
