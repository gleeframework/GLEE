"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $15,000.
* Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000.
* However, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering. There is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000 but still above her minimum value of $8,000.
* This gives me room to negotiate further if she rejects my offer.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,000 or $10,000, which would be a great deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is higher than my initial counteroffer but still below my maximum willingness to pay.
* There is still potential to negotiate further, as her minimum value is $8,000, and I'm willing to go up to $15,000.
* I will continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer to $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,000 and Alice's latest offer of $12,500.
* This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price than she's offered.
*  I believe this offer is reasonable and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's latest offer of $12,750 is getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. 
* I believe there is still room to negotiate, especially since her minimum value is $8,000.
* I will continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $11,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price.
*  This offer is closer to Alice's last offer of $12,750, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
* I'm willing to go a little higher than my previous offer, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's $15,000."
