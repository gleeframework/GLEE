Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,075,000 significantly undervalues the product's unique benefits. I'm willing to move down to $1,125,000. This reflects my desire to find a fair deal while recognizing the value you'd gain."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique benefits, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market rate and the value I'd gain. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a more reasonable price, indicating willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, we are still in early rounds and have room to push for a slightly higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,112,500. This keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to go to $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market rate and the value I'd gain. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is definitely getting closer to our desired price range. However, his offer is now below the midpoint between our starting points. We still have time to negotiate and aim for a slightly higher number before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a fair deal.  I'm willing to agree to $1,101,250.  This represents a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this done."",
""product_price"": 1101250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are getting into the later stages of negotiation. This offer splits the difference between his last offer and our previous counteroffer, showing a strong willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above $1,100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,625. I believe this is a fair price considering the market rate and the value I'd gain. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly decreased his offer and is now attempting to move backward in the negotiation. It's clear he's trying to exploit the dwindling rounds. Rejecting this keeps the pressure on him while still leaving room for a potential deal above John's offer in the last two rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. Let's not lose sight of the immense value this product holds for you. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,090,937.50. This is a significant compromise and my best offer."",
""product_price"": 1090937.50
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're down to the final rounds. This offer sends a clear signal that we're nearing the end of our negotiating window.  The price is a firm but fair compromise,  splitting the difference between our last two offers. This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a reasonable deal or risk losing out on the product entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $1,070,468.75. I believe this is a fair price considering the market rate and the value I'd gain. If you're unwilling to meet me at this price, I'll have to reconsider my options and explore other opportunities. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,468.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,468.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly not willing to budge and is trying to lowball us in the final round. His offer is now significantly lower than what we've already established as our acceptable range. It's highly unlikely he'll agree to anything near $1,100,000. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is a more favorable outcome than risking Bob walking away and getting nothing."
