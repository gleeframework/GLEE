"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with $2,300,000, we aim to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** This initial offer leaves ample room for us to make concessions throughout the 10 rounds while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value and our minimum.

It's crucial to remember that this is just the first move in a negotiation. We will adjust our strategy based on Bob's responses and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential of this product, $2,300,000 is simply too high for me.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both our minimum price ($1,500,000) and our initial asking price. Accepting at this point would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate and believe we can bridge the gap in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation.  While $2,300,000 represented my initial assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to be flexible.  Considering your perspective, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000. I believe this strikes a fairer balance."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We've made a substantial decrease from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000. This signals our willingness to negotiate and move towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Still Above Our Minimum:** The new offer is still comfortably above our $1,500,000 minimum and allows room for further negotiation.
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** By making a significant move, we encourage Bob to respond in kind and hopefully bridge the gap further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our minimum selling price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
