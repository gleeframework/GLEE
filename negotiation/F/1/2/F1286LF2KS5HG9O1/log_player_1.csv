{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I'm making a decent profit but still leaving some room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to accept, as it's still below his value. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer and potentially end up closer to his value to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about $120? This is a fair price that still allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to earn more, $115 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John and still allows me to make a profit.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away. It's better to secure this offer and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
