Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for my desired price, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer yet. I'll counter Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to see if we can make this work.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am still aiming to keep my investment under $1,000,000. Could you consider bringing the price down to $1,050,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,050,000 is still too low.  I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer yet, as I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price.  I'm going to counter Bob again and see if we can bridge the gap."

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still too low. I'm committed to getting as close to my $1,500,000 target as possible.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap and find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe this product is worth every penny. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
