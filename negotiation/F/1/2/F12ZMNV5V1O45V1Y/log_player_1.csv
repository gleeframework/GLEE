Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at the desired minimum price."
