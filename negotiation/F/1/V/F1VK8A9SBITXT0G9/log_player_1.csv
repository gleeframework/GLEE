Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from it.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $915,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum, and avoids the risk of a stalled negotiation leading to a sale at $800,000 to John."
