"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's get this done! ",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,250,000 is too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,350,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,300,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000.  This shows I'm flexible, but we're getting close to the end of our negotiations. Let me know what you think.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,325,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll also take the product's accessories for free. That's my final offer.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
