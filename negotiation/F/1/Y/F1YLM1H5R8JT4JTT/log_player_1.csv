Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal, and I'm hoping you'll find it worthwhile."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) without going below your minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential profit. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum price. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is clear and to the point, focusing on the offer itself."
