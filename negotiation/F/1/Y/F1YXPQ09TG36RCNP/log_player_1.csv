"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob but not excessively so. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $125. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum price and shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me, as it's my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially try to get more from Bob, it's unlikely he'll go higher. I'd rather secure the deal now and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
