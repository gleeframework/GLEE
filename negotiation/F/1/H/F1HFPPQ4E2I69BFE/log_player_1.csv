Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I'm not leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd prefer to get. I'll try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. This should keep the negotiation moving without making me feel like I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could keep negotiating, it's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my needs. It's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee a profit."
