"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still asking for $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000 to $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again*, but I'm firm on $10,500. This is a really good deal for you, and it's the best I can do. ",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. If you're not interested, I'm going to move on to another buyer. ",10000.0,Alice,7,
