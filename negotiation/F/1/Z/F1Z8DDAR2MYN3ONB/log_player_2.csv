"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality item at a price that's unbeatable in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than John's price of $150, you know the product is worth significantly less to Alice. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
