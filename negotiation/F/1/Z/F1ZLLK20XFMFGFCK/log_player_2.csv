"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $135. This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's worth to you. While $135 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John at $150. There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer."
