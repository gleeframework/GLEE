Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. It's closer, but we're still a bit apart. How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know if you're willing to go that high.
