"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price still leaves significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. ",925000.0,Alice,3,
