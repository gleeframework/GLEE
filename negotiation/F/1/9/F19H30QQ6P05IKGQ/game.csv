"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. However, I need to make a fair profit, so I'm starting with an offer of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  I could go up to $1,150,000.  Do you think we can make that work?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to be more flexible. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,200,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000, which is $1,300,000. I'm making one final counteroffer at this price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
