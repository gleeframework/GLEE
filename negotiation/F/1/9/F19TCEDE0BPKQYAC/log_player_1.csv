Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer waiting."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is still a significant discount for Bob compared to the product's worth to him ($1,000,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While not explicitly stated, the message's tone implies there might be a slight wiggle room in the price, should Bob try to negotiate."
