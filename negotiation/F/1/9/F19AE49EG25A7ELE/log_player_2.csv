# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save money and the product is worth the same to you from both Alice and John, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. You can then buy the product from John for the same price, ensuring you don't overpay."
