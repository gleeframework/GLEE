"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. This price takes into account the value you place on the product, while also giving me a fair return on my investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired return. Let's work towards an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
