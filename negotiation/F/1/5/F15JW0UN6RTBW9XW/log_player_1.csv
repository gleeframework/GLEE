{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential returns it can bring to your specific needs. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential returns"" aims to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus from his perceived value. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone is collaborative, inviting Bob's input and suggesting a willingness to negotiate further."
