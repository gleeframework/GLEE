"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  Would you consider a price of $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,060,000, which is $1,067,500. This is my final offer. What are your thoughts?",1067500.0,Alice,7,
