This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm open to negotiation. It's important to be polite and establish a good rapport with Bob while also setting a strong initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $950,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I am open to negotiation, I need to hold out for a more reasonable price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,075,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to go above $1,025,000 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good deal and don't risk losing out to John."
