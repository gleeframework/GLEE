,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $12000. How about we try $13500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $12800 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13200? It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",13200.0,Alice,5,
