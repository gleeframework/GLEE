"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm starting the price at $18000, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $14000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000,  but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $15500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go.",15500.0,Bob,4,
