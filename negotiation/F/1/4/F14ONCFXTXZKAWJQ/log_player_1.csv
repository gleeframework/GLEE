I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'm taking a calculated risk.  If Bob accepts, great! If not, I still have John who's willing to pay my minimum price."
