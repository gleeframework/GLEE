"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I believe its value far exceeds $8,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget of $8,000 and John's offer of $8,000. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John directly."
