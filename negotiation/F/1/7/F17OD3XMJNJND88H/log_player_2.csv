"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than your desired price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $1,000,000, which is closer to your desired price of $800,000. While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject your next offer, and you'll have to buy from John at $800,000.  It's safer to accept Alice's offer, as it saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
