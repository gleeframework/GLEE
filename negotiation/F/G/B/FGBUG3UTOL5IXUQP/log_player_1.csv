"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value to me is significantly higher. I believe this price reflects the potential benefits you'll gain from owning it."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I can only consider a price of $950,000 for your product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least reach a point where selling to John becomes the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're seeking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 less than what John is offering. Given the limited number of rounds, it's a sensible decision to accept this offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this deal still allows me to secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
