"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,450,000 is a good price, it's still higher than your ideal limit of $1,000,000. You have leverage here because you can always walk away and buy from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to start with my ideal price, $1,000,000. This is the price I'm willing to pay at most.  Since Alice knows I can buy from John for this price, it's a good starting point to see if she's willing to meet me there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my ideal limit.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down further, especially since she rejected my counteroffer and is likely feeling some pressure to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to move a little but still trying to get the best price. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable offer and agree to the deal. If she rejects, I'll know she's not very motivated to sell at my target price, and I'll be more likely to accept her offer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is close to my ideal price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to pay less, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a higher price from Alice or having to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of $150,000. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price."
