"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its value to you, I understand its worth is estimated at $15,000. Considering this, I would like to offer you the opportunity to acquire it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant saving compared to its market value. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer is significantly marked down from her perceived value of $15,000. By rejecting her first offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further, getting you a better deal."
