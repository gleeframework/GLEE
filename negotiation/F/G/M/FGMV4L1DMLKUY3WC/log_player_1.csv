Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of such high quality."", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $150, I'm signaling that I'm willing to come down, but I'm also aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justifying the Price:** Mentioning ""high quality"" aims to subtly nudge Bob's perception of the product's value upwards.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  How Bob responds will be crucial. If he outright rejects $150, I'll need to significantly lower the price or consider John's offer. 
* **Time:** I won't want to get stuck in endless back-and-forth with Bob. John's offer of $120 is my safety net and a reminder that time is also a factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, it shows he's interested. There's still a chance to negotiate a price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer that's significantly lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum.  I need to balance showing flexibility with maintaining a firm stance on my product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand $150 is a stretch, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  Dropping to $110 from $150 shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a profit if Bob accepts.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to make a similar move towards a compromise. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I need to be prepared for Bob to reject this offer as well. If he counters with anything below $100, I'll likely take John's offer. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** While I want to maximize my profit, dragging out negotiations indefinitely isn't ideal. I need to keep John's standing offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $95.  I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Unlikely to Negotiate Higher:** Bob seems to be fixated on incremental increases.  Even with further rounds of negotiation, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's acceptable to me.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing a guaranteed sale at my desired price.  It's time to move on to John's offer."
