"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $12500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm interested in the product but would need to see it closer to $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9000.  That's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $10500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and my previous offer of $10500. I'll sell the product to you for $10000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,7,
