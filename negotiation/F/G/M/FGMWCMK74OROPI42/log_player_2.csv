It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $150, there's no harm in seeing if you can get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $140, which is within my budget and a good deal. There's no guarantee that I'll get a lower price if I keep negotiating, so I'll accept this offer."
