"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $800,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  How about we settle at $725,000?  This represents a significant savings for me while still recognizing the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell it to you for $775,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $750,000? It seems like a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $780,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",780000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll sell it to you for $785,000.
