"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I signal that I'm open to negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject and present a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a compromise, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000.  This offer takes our respective positions into account while still reflecting the inherent worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** I'm politely but firmly explaining that Bob's previous offer was unrealistic.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, I'm staying firmly above my $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise and Value:**  The message highlights the concept of finding a middle ground while reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Potential for More:**  Bob moving to his perceived value suggests there might be room for him to go higher. I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to see if I can bridge the remaining gap.
* **John as Backup:** I have the security of selling to John for my minimum price if negotiations stall."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on price. To be candid, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,200,000.  I'm willing to accept that if we can close the deal now. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I'm being upfront with Bob about my minimum acceptable price. This builds trust and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting it as a final offer and suggesting an immediate close, I'm encouraging Bob to act decisively.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that the price is fair based on the product's value, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of getting a reasonable deal."
