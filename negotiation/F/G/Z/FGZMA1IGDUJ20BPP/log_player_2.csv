"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $130 is better than $150 from John, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $115?  I'm really hoping to get this product, but I'm on a bit of a budget."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $115 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to come down to $120. That would still give me a fair profit, and I think it's a good deal for you too, considering how much you value this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still a good deal for Bob. He can get the product for $30 less than what John is offering.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up having to pay the full $150 to John."
