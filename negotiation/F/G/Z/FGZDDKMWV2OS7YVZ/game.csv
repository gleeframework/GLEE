"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value significantly exceeds your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, it seems we're still quite far apart in our valuations. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge the gap, but I need you to meet me closer to the product's true value. I'll offer it for $1,100,000. This is my final concession.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
