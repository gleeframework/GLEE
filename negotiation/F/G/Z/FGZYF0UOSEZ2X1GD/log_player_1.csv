Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  If you can't do $700,000, I think it's best I explore other options.

**Reasoning:**  Bob has shown he's unwilling to move significantly on price.  While we could continue negotiating, it's highly unlikely we'll reach a deal even close to John's offer of $1,500,000. Cutting our losses and selling to John guarantees the best outcome at this point."
