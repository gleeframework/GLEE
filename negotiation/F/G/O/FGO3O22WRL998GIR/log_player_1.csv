I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a decent profit margin while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle. If he rejects, we can start a negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it immediately. I'd like to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a comfortable profit.  I believe this price is fair given the value of the product and the fact that Bob is clearly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is too low, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000, as this is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
