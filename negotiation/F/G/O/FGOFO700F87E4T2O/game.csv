"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me is $10000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me is $10000.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13000 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is $15000. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $14500. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
