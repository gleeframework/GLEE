"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.

Alice is firm on $850,000, and it seems like we've reached a stalemate. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's still a good deal for me.  Buying from John would cost significantly more."
