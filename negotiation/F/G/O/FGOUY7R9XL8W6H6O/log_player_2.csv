Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000. While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price.  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is your target maximum."
