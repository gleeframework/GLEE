"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
