Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, my budget for this purchase is a bit tighter than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's above your valuation. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
