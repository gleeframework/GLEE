"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, my budget for this purchase is a bit tighter than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's above your valuation. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
