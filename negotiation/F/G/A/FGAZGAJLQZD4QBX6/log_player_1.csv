"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential profit. I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate, and I have room to lower the price if necessary.  This offer leaves room for both of us to compromise and find a price that works for both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for a higher price. Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $13,500. This is a good compromise that still allows me to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'll accept the offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
