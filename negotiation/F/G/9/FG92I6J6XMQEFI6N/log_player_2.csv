"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

}

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to understand Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would give you a good price while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice is moving closer to my price range, but I think there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?"",

``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground while still leaving space to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $775,000 for the product.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and this offer gets us a decent discount while staying below John's price. It's a good deal!"
