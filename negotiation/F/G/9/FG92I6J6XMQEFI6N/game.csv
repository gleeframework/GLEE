"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would give you a good price while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $775,000 for the product.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
