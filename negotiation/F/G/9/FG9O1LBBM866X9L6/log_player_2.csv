# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum price of $10,000. It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate for a lower price, or simply buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm willing to offer $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $11200. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,200 is still above your maximum price of $10,000.  It's better to buy from John, who is willing to sell you the product for your maximum price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a better deal, and you risk wasting more time."
