"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential and value, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer of $1,400,000. This is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer provides room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
 
This strategy aims to gauge Bob's eagerness and establish a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, I still have room to negotiate and aim higher. I'm confident I can convince him to agree to a price closer to my initial offer. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is my fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise, considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by reducing my price by $25,000, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's significant value and potential for high returns to justify the adjusted price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While I'm flexible, I want to avoid drastically lowering the price too early in the negotiation. 
 
This counteroffer aims to keep Bob engaged while still striving for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily increased his offer, and we are now at $1,350,000. This is a significant profit above my minimum selling price of $1,200,000. 

While I could potentially push for a bit more in the following rounds, there's a risk that Bob might not go much higher. Accepting now secures a great deal and avoids the possibility of the negotiation stalling or Bob withdrawing his interest."
