Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You know Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Aiming high, but staying reasonable:**  Offering it at $100 gives Bob a $20 discount, making it very appealing while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $100 is a strong starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate further. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
