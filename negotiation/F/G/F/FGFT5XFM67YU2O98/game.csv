"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to make a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I can meet you at $13,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer for now.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $12,750. This would be a good middle ground for us, and would allow us to close the deal.",12750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $12,750. I can meet you at $13,200, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my last offer before considering other options.",13200.0,Alice,7,
