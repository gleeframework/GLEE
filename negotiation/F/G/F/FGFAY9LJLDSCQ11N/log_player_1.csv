Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still remaining significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing the potential profit from the sale."
