"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal.
* Bob is willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for negotiation. 
* It's always a good strategy to see if a better offer can be reached before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial price, but still within Bob's acceptable range.
* The message is friendly and shows interest in the product. 
* This sets the stage for a negotiation where Bob can try to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, making this a good compromise.
* While Bob could potentially try for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially making a counteroffer closer to her original price is high.
* At this point, it's likely more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that's still within his budget."
