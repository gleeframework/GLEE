"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate.**  He can make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money.
* **Buying from John is too expensive.**  John's price is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, and there's no reason to go there immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This would leave room for both of us to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 is a substantial undervaluation.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. I believe this price point recognizes its worth while still offering you a great opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's lowered the price, it's still above what Bob wants to pay.  
* **More negotiation is needed.**  There's room for Alice to lower her price further.  
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000,  which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.  I believe this price reflects a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I acknowledge your willingness to move on the price, and to bridge the remaining gap I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's desired price.** While he'd prefer a lower price,  $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Alice has stated this is her final offer.**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. 
* **Accepting the offer saves Bob $100,000** compared to buying from John. 

Given these factors, it makes the most sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
