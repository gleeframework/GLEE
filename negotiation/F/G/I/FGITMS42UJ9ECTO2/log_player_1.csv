Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This would leave room for both of us to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000,  which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.  I believe this price reflects a mutually beneficial agreement.
