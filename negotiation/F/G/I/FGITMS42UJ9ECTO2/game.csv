"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This would leave room for both of us to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 is a substantial undervaluation.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. I believe this price point recognizes its worth while still offering you a great opportunity.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000,  which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.  I believe this price reflects a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I acknowledge your willingness to move on the price, and to bridge the remaining gap I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
