{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's valuation but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the ""fantastic deal"" and emphasizing fairness. This can encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a high price to maximize my potential profit, but I'm also keeping in mind the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and consider whether to accept or make a new counteroffer based on how close it is to my minimum acceptable price.
* Throughout the negotiation, I'll use a combination of logic and persuasion to try and secure a price that's as close as possible to my minimum acceptable price.
* If the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes unproductive, I have the option to sell to John and guarantee my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to receive.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm not going to settle for $900,000 right away. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* By rejecting his offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product.
* I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still reasonable for Bob.
* If Bob continues to be unwilling to pay my desired price, I'm prepared to sell to John and guarantee my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for something closer to $950,000. This product is truly valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being a great deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Message:** I'm reaffirming the value of the product and emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer. I'm also positioning my counteroffer as a reasonable compromise.

**Strategy:**

* By increasing my offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price too far below my minimum acceptable price.
* I'm aiming to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us.
* If Bob rejects my offer again, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.
*  I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price but still reasonable for Bob.
*  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to be unwilling to pay a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $937,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 937500}

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $937,500, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $925,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still striving for a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Message:** I emphasize the fairness of my offer, highlighting that it reflects the value of the product while still being a good deal for Bob. I also express a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

* I'm using a tactic of gradual concessions to show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but also that I won't settle for a price too far below my minimum acceptable price.
* By offering a price that is still higher than Bob's but lower than my previous offer, I am hoping to entice him to accept.
* If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll have to carefully weigh my options:  accept his offer, make a final counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'll meet you at $930,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $930,000 is still below my desired price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Considering that it's his final offer, I'm going to accept it.  

**Strategy:**

*  I'm prioritizing getting a deal done, as I don't want to risk losing out on the sale entirely.
*  I've already made several concessions, and this is a good outcome considering Bob's initial offer of $900,000.
*  It's also important to acknowledge that further negotiations might not yield a significantly higher price, and I might end up with the same outcome as selling to John.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
