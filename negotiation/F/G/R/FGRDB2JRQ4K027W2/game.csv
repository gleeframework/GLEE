"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $14,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite ready to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers, at $10,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finalize this purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,500? It's a fair price that still leaves some room for negotiation, but gets me closer to where I need to be.",11500.0,Alice,5,
