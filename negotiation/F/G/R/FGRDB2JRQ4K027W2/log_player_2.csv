While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still too high for Bob.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,500? It's a fair price that still leaves some room for negotiation, but gets me closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice.  He can save $3,500 compared to Alice's final offer."
