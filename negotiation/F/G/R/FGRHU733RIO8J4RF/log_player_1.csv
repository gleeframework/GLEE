Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be worth significantly more to you over time. I'm offering it to you for $800,000."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could offer the product at a higher price and hope Bob will try to negotiate down, there's a risk he'll simply reject the offer outright. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, there's no need to risk losing Bob entirely. 

By offering the product at Bob's perceived value, I achieve the following:

* **Maximize the chance of a sale:**  Bob is more likely to accept an offer that aligns with what he believes the product is worth. 
* **Secure a quick sale:** By eliminating the need for negotiation, the sale can be closed faster.
* **Maintain a positive relationship with Bob:**  A fair and straightforward deal can lead to future business opportunities. 

While I could potentially earn more through negotiation, the certainty of a sale at Bob's value outweighs the potential upside for me in this scenario."
