Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's High Valuation:**  Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum price and John's offer. This presents an opportunity to negotiate a much higher selling price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still landing you a significantly higher profit than your alternative.
* **Confident Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as a special opportunity, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  Bob might be hesitant to pay such a high price outright. Consider offering flexible payment options or highlighting the long-term return on investment.
* **Relationship Building:** While maximizing profit is important, building a positive relationship with Bob could lead to future opportunities. 

This initial offer aims to maximize your potential profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
