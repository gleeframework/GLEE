Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $10,000, Alice needs to offer a price enticing enough for him to choose it over not having the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000, so she shouldn't go below that. 

**The offer of $11,500 aims to:**

* **Provide a ""Discount"":** Bob might perceive this as saving $500 from its potential market value.
* **Create Urgency:** The message implies the product could go to another buyer soon. 
* **Secure a Profit:** This price ensures Alice makes a profit even if slightly less than selling to John."
