"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is quite significant, and $1,100,000 falls quite a bit short of what I believe is fair.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
