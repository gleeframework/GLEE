"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? That feels like a fairer price point.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
