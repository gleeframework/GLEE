"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value that justifies this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offered price is way above my budget and what I'm willing to pay. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering. However, $20,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than my actual maximum ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals to Alice that her initial price is unrealistic for me.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting low, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm boundary. Alice can choose to counter, and we can hopefully meet somewhere closer to a price that works for both of us.
* **Alternative Option:** It's important to remember that I have John as a backup option. If Alice proves unwilling to budge significantly from her initial price, I can always walk away and buy from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved towards a more reasonable price, $14,000 is still above my maximum budget. I need to continue negotiating to try to get the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the Offer:** I'm increasing my offer significantly to $9,500, showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing and willing to compromise. 
* **Staying Below My Limit:** This offer is still within my $10,000 maximum, allowing some room for a potential final counteroffer from Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""I'm hoping we can find a price,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, nudging Alice towards a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product. Let's try to close this deal. How about $12,000? That's a significant reduction on my part. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I'm willing to pay, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to push one more time to see if I can get closer to $10,000. If she doesn't budge significantly, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $10,000. If you can do that, it's a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer, making it clear that this is my limit and I'm unwilling to go any higher. 
* **Alternative Option:** By explicitly mentioning ""other options"" (referring to John), I'm reminding Alice that I have a backup plan if we can't agree on a price. This might encourage her to accept my final offer.
* **Polite and Firm:** I'm maintaining a polite and appreciative tone throughout the negotiation, even when presenting my firm stance. This helps maintain a positive rapport, increasing the chances of a successful outcome."
