"Hello Alice, thanks for offering. However, $20,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product. Let's try to close this deal. How about $12,000? That's a significant reduction on my part.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $10,000. If you can do that, it's a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
