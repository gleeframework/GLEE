"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to negotiating further.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference from our previous offers? I'll do $7,750.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,750. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $8,200. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8200.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7,900, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8100.0,Alice,7,
