"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $10,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another chance to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still above Bob's target price of $8,000.  While there are still a few rounds left, Bob has reached a point where the potential savings by continuing to negotiate are not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price."
