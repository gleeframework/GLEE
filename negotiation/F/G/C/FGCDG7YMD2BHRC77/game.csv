"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me.  How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet at $115. I'm ready to finalize the deal if we can agree on this price.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount. I can offer it to you for $122. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",122.0,Alice,5,
