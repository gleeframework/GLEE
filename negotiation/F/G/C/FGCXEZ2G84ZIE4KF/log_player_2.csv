# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
