"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the potential in it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

We start with a significantly lower offer to understand Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'll offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price given the value we both see in it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

We're getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation before we consider John's offer. Let's see if Alice is willing to move closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($11,500) and our last counteroffer ($10,000).
* This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a significant discount.
* We're still a good margin away from John's backup offer, giving us room to potentially go higher if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,250. This is really my final offer, as I need to ensure I get a good price for this valuable product. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has signaled this is her final offer.
* The price of $11,250 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $750 from John's offer. 
* Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, risking the deal and forcing us to buy from John at full price."
