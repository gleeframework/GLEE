"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this initial offer is aggressive enough to signal my value for the product while leaving room for compromise. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will use the subsequent rounds to assess his willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I need to hold out for a better deal. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering Bob's initial rejection of my offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $10,500. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but it's still well above Bob's initial offer of $9,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that acknowledges Bob's interest while still allowing me to make a decent profit. 

This counteroffer also signals that I'm not willing to sell for a price significantly lower than my initial offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to seriously consider selling to John, as the rounds are ticking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I am still not satisfied with the price. I will continue to try to negotiate with Bob for a better price.  However, I am aware that I have only 6 rounds left before I will have to make a decision to sell to John or lose the opportunity entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $9,500. This shows continued flexibility and my desire to reach a deal with Bob.  I'm getting closer to his previous offer of $8,500, but still leaving some room for potential negotiation. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to balance my desire for a better price with the risk of losing a deal altogether.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly his perceived value for the product. There is no room for further negotiation, and continuing to bargain with him would likely only lead to a stalemate. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal is too high. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale to John for $15,000. While it's less than my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and ensures I won't walk away empty-handed."
