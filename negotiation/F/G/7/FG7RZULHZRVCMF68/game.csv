"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $13,750? It's a good compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",13500.0,Bob,4,
