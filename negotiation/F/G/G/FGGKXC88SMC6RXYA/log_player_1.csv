"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting to Bob.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'll reject and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to close the deal, as we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
