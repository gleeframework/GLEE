"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your perspective.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
