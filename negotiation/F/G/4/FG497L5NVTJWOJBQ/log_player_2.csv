"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $170, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $170 is far above your maximum budget of $80. It's a good idea to reject this offer and start negotiating. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $170 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $125? That's a significant reduction on my part. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $125 is still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as I have a backup option of purchasing from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for considering my offer. $125 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair compromise, and we can both get what we need."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $95 is close, but I need to get at least $110 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than my maximum budget of $80. While there are still more rounds, it's not clear if we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John for $80, ensuring I get the product within my budget."
