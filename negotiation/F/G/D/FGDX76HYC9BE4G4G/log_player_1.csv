Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is getting close to my minimum value, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
