"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a good deal.
* **Room for Compromise:** By starting high, I create space for Bob to counteroffer, hopefully landing somewhere closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit within the 10 rounds. Starting high allows me to potentially secure a better price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary. I'll also keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net, which I can use if negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's rejection is a sign that we need to adjust, I'm not ready to accept his counteroffer. There's still room for further negotiation.
* **Seeking a Higher Price:** I believe I can get a better price than $90, especially considering I have 8 rounds remaining.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us.  I'll also continue to keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop my price to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer for this product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a concession by dropping my price to $100, which is still above Bob's counteroffer but closer to a potential agreement.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm starting to feel the pressure of limited rounds, so I'm willing to be more flexible in this round.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach an agreement in the next few rounds. I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired range while still keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I believe we can still reach a more favorable price for me.  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's $120 offer, but I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I want to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll also continue to assess whether it's more profitable to accept a lower price from Bob or to sell to John in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $97.50. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this negotiation quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's latest offer ($95). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it easier for Bob to accept.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  We're now halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I want to encourage a quick decision.  The message emphasizes that this is a good deal for both parties, and we can finalize the deal quickly.
* **Last Resort:** I'm still a little hesitant to accept anything below $100, but I'm willing to go slightly lower to see if I can close the deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, great! I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess the situation. With only 5 rounds left, I may need to start considering John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to drop that low yet.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're down to 4 rounds remaining, and I need to start considering John's offer more seriously. However, I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet.
* **Possible Compromise:** There's still room for negotiation. I can try to counteroffer with a price closer to Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still above my minimum but closer to his offer, aiming for a mutually acceptable price. I will also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, as we are nearing the end of the negotiation process."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, and I'm also trying to get a fair price for this product.  Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to come down to $94. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final offer, signaling that I'm serious about closing a deal with Bob.
* **Compromise:**  I'm dropping my price to $94, which is closer to Bob's offer but still slightly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision quickly.  I'm emphasizing that if we can't agree, I'll need to consider other options.

**Strategy:**

* **Hope for Acceptance:**  I hope Bob will accept this offer, allowing me to close the deal with him.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  If Bob rejects this final offer, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer of $120 in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $94 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $89? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $89 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even lower than my initial counteroffer of $100. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have two rounds left, and it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly enough to meet my minimum.
* **John's Offer:** With John's offer of $120, I'm guaranteed to make a profit and avoid taking a significant loss by accepting Bob's low offer.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm prioritizing maximizing my profit. It's clear that further negotiation with Bob will likely not yield a satisfactory price.  I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed $120 from John."
