"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $100 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $150.  It's a good deal, so accepting is the best choice in this round."
