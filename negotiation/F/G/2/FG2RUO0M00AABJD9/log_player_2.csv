"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is above your maximum value of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject and make a counteroffer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value we both place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above your maximum value of $1,000,000.  There is still room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1050000, which is $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum value of $1,000,000. While you could accept and save some money compared to buying from John, there's still room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer might lead to a better deal for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a small increase from my previous offer and shows my willingness to work with you. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1075000, which is $1112500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and I'd like to see some movement from your end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is lower than her previous offers, it is still above your maximum value of $1,000,000. With only a few rounds left, there is a high chance that you will not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. To avoid the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product and having to pay a significantly higher price from John, it is better to secure the product from John at $1,500,000."
