"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value we both place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1050000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1050000, which is $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1075000, which is a fair compromise. It's a small increase from my previous offer and shows my willingness to work with you. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1075000, which is $1112500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and I'd like to see some movement from your end.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
