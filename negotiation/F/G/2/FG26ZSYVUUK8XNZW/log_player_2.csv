Round 3

This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'll offer you a price of $975,000, but I'll throw in a small bonus of a 2-year warranty, which will give you extra peace of mind and protection for your investment. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very attached to her valuation and is unlikely to move significantly from her last offer. While the warranty is a nice bonus, it doesn't justify paying more than John's price. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best possible price from John."
