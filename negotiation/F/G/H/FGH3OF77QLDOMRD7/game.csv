"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $16,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference and meet at $14,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet at $14,000. I can do $16,500, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",16500.0,Alice,5,
