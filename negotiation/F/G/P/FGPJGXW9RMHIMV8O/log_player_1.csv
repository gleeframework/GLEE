Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm interested in your product, $1100000 is a bit above my initial target. I'd like to propose a price of $950000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $1,025,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you place on it."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
