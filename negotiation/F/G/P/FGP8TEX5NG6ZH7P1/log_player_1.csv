Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value and the potential for a quick deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a quick deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer one more time, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go any lower than $1,450,000. This is a final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer. This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. His offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to sell to John.  While it's not ideal to not get the highest possible price, it's important to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
