"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800,000? I appreciate your understanding and flexibility.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. I am still unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a final offer, which I believe is fair given the current market conditions and the value I place on the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
