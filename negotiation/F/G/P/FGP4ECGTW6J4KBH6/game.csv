"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about we aim for $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I had in mind. This product offers tremendous potential for your business, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. To move forward, I could consider $2,000,000.  This reflects a more reasonable compromise while still acknowledging the product's true value.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I'm still working within a specific budget. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $1,800,000? This would allow me to invest in the product without straining my finances too much.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. Let's split the difference. How about $1,900,000? I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Let's try $1,850,000. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers, allowing me to secure the product within my financial limits.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
