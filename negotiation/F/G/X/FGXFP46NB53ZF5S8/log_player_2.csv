"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $1,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant reduction, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is aiming to find a price that works for both parties, while keeping in mind his goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can still get a better price. He's already made a counteroffer, and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still not there yet. I can offer you $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a middle ground.  He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's serious about buying the product, but still keeping the price lower than Alice's last offer. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $10,875. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,875 is a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than what he would pay John, and it's likely that Alice will not budge further. Accepting this offer ensures that Bob gets the product at a good price within a reasonable number of rounds."
