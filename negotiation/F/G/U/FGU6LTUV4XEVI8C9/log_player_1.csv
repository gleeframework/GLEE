"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still within a range where he might consider it. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy for the next round based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and I'm not willing to sell it at that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to accept.  I'm confident I can secure a better price, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $105. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still higher than what Bob is currently offering.  I'm hoping this will convince him to finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, we're running out of time. I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach an agreement that works for both of us before the negotiation ends.  Selling to John ensures I get a fair price for the product without risking any further losses."
