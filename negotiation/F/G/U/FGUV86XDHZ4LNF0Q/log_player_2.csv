{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice's offer is $950,000. This is significantly higher than your target price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to lower the price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above my maximum target of $800,000. This will hopefully give Alice room to negotiate while still being a considerable savings for me."

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. It's closer to my target, but I'm still willing to try and negotiate further. I have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to try and get a better deal."
