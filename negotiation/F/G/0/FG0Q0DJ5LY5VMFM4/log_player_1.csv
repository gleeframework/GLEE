Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Would you be willing to consider an offer in the range of $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming High, but Reasonably:** Starting with an offer of $1,150,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) between Bob's valuation and your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob.  It acknowledges that you're seeking a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a strong fallback position with John, who's willing to pay your minimum price. This empowers you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a particularly tough negotiator, you might adjust the starting price slightly lower. 
* **Product Urgency:**  If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower starting point might be strategic.

This offer balances ambition with a collaborative tone, aiming to secure the best possible outcome for you while still enticing Bob to engage in the negotiation."
