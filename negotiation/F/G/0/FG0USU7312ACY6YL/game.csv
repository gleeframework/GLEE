"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant saving.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. I really think that's a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
