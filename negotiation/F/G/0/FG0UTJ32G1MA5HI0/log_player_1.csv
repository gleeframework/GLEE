Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it still leaves me with a profit of $200,000. It's also a price that Bob might be willing to accept, given that it's $200,000 less than what the product is worth to him. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to carefully consider his counteroffer. I can either accept it, counter with a new offer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter and hopefully get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to finalize this transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I still feel that we could find a better solution for both of us. I am proposing to purchase your product for $960,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer of $960,000 is a good compromise. It's a substantial profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  I'm confident I can find another buyer later if this deal falls through."
