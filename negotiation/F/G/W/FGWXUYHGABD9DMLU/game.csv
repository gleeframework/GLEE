"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $80? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my maximum budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Alice,5,
