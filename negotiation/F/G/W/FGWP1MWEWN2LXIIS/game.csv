"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $132.50. It's a small step down from my original offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
