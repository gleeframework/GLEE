Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable value:** This protects your minimum profit margin. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price higher or lower depending on Bob's response.

I'm hoping for a quick deal with Bob, but if he rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer or move on to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth it to me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let me know if you're willing to come up to that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not going to budge any lower than $11,000.  If he rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to either make another offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe $10,000 is the most I can realistically pay for this product. I hope we can reach an agreement close to this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price. While it's tempting to keep trying, I've reached my limit.  I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $11,000, and it seems Bob won't go higher.  To ensure a decent profit, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
