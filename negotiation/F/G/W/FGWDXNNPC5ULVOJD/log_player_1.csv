{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's potential for Alice to earn more than her minimum acceptable price from John ($1,200,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a $100,000 margin for Bob (his perceived value minus the price). This makes the offer attractive while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides Alice with a safety net. This allows her to aim higher with Bob without the risk of being left with no sale."
