Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob declines).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 (He won't pay more than this).
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists, but it's small. Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your reservation price, you hold a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering its long-term benefits."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,450,000 anchors the negotiation high. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""long-term benefits"" subtly implies the price is justified without revealing your bottom line.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is above Bob's value, it leaves a small window for him to potentially counter-offer if he's highly motivated. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower within the ZOPA. 
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you could consider a more generous offer. However, remember you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
