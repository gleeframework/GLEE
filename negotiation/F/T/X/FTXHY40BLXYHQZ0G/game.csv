"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1800000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to consider it.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, however, and I believe $1500000 is a fair price that accounts for both our needs. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me.  I believe $1350000 is a fair price that represents a substantial move from my initial offer. I'm confident this price is fair to both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point and appreciate your continued interest. While I believe the product's worth is higher, I'm ready to make a final concession.  $1450000 reflects a fair value for both of us. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
