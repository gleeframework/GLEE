Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce to Bob that the price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrases ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal to Bob that you are open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. You need to be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. If he outright rejects your initial offer, you might need to lower the price to somewhere between $12,000 and $15,000 to avoid having to sell to John at your minimum price."
