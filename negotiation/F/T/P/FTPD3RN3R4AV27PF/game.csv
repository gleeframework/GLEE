"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,125?  This feels like a fair compromise.",12125.0,Alice,5,
