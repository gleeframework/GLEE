Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,000,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a fallback option with John ($1,000,000), so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

This approach aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
