Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, knowing it's likely higher than Bob's value. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $100, so I need to at least get that much. 
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential counteroffers from Bob, allowing me to assess his interest and ultimately aim for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he's still engaged.  Rejecting his counteroffer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $100, I want to maximize my earnings if possible.  There's a chance I can get a better price from Bob with continued negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, reflecting the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by making a counter-offer. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  $90 is a compromise between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $65. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the counter-offer, highlighting the product's value to further encourage Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm setting a clear lower limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Limits:**  Bob has shown a reluctance to significantly increase his offer, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a better outcome.
* **Guaranteeing a Profit:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed profit of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better deal.

Given the limited potential for improvement with Bob and the guaranteed profit from John, selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point."
