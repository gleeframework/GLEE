``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), while leaving room for potential negotiation and a final price closer to Bob's perceived value ($15,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can get closer to $14,000.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if I can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
