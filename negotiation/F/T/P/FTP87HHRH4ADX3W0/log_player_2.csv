"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $13,500 is more than his ideal price, it's still less than John's price and within his budget.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in further back-and-forth and might even lead to Alice getting frustrated and withdrawing her offer. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob while minimizing potential risks."
