"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not quite ready to let the product go at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
