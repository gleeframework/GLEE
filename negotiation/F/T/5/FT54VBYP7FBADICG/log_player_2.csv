"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum value of $12,000.  Offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation,  showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  The counteroffer in round 2 was close, and there is still room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's last offer.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price.  While $14,200 is better than John's offer, there's still a chance to get a lower price.  The counteroffer in round 4 was close, and there is still room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, he is still aiming for a price lower than Alice's last offer.  This counteroffer tries to find a middle ground between Bob's desired price and Alice's last offer, increasing the chances of a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting dangerously close to John's price.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better price is too high.  The potential savings are not worth the chance of Alice refusing the next counteroffer and forcing Bob to pay John's higher price.  Buying from John guarantees the product at a known price, even if it is slightly higher than Alice's current offer."
