Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe its value will bring you great benefit. What do you think about an offer of $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better outcome. $1,000,000 is a significant profit margin.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering it for a price too close to $1,200,000 might discourage Bob.  $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a substantial gain for me.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly eliminates the need to wait for John's purchase, even if John's offer is slightly higher."
