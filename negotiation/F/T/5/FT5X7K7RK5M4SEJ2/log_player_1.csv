Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer gauges Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. His response will dictate your next move â€“ whether to negotiate further or move on to John. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts or counters with a price higher than your minimum ($1,000,000), you'll earn a significant profit."
