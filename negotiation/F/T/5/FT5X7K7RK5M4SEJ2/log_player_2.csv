"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save the $500,000."
