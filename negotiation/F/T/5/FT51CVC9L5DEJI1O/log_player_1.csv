"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a figure above your desired outcome. This provides room for concessions and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initial proposal"" and ""starting point"" explicitly signals that you're open to negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Setting a high initial price can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's reaction to this offer will provide valuable insight into his willingness to pay.
3. **Maintain Flexibility:** We retain the option to adjust our price strategically in subsequent rounds.

Remember, our fallback is selling to John for $1,200,000, so we have some leeway in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum ($1,200,000) and our initial asking price.  Rejecting this offer signals:

* **We're serious:** It demonstrates that we're not going to immediately concede to a lowball offer.
* **Value perception:** It reinforces that we believe the product is worth more than his initial offer. 

We have ample room for negotiation, and selling to John for our minimum is a good fallback option if we can't reach a more agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can go down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We're dropping our price by $150,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. However, it's not a drastic drop, keeping us well above his offer and our minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:**  We're reiterating the product's value to avoid appearing solely driven by profit. This might resonate with Bob and make him more receptive. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** We haven't explicitly mentioned John, but not immediately accepting his offer suggests we have other options, potentially encouraging Bob to be more flexible.

This counteroffer:

1. **Maintains a strong position:** We're still aiming high but showing a willingness to compromise.
2. **Encourages a counteroffer:**  The size of our reduction might prompt Bob to raise his offer significantly. 
3. **Keeps John as a viable option:**  We're still in a good position to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is now above our minimum threshold of $1,200,000. While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, accepting this offer makes the most sense for the following reasons:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,300,000 is a $100,000 profit over our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob has significantly increased his offer, demonstrating a strong interest in closing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging negotiations could lead to missed opportunities or unforeseen circumstances. Accepting now secures a good profit immediately. 

While there's a chance we could extract a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of him reducing his offer or walking away outweighs the potential reward. This acceptance solidifies a favorable outcome."
