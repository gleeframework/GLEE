"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get more, Bob's offer matches John's offer.  Since I'm limited to 10 rounds and don't know Bob's true value, accepting this offer secures my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation."
