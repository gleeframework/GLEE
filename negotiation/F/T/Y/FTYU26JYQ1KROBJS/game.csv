"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. Would you be interested in that price?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you at $135. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it!",135.0,Alice,5,
