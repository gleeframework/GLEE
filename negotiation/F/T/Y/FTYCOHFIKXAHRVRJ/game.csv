"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to both of us, and allows for a decent profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a significant profit for you, while allowing me to secure a fair return on my investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's reach an agreement in this round.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
