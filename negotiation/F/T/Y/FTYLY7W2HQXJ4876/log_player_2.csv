"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is less than what John is selling it for, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  This strategy allows Bob to potentially secure the product for even less than $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $87.50. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While he could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good compromise and falls within Bob's budget of $100.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
