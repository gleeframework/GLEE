"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,250 is still a bit below where I need to be.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,400. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know if this works for you.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $10,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no higher. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",10000.0,Bob,6,
