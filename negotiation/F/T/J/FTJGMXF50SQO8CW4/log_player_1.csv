Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts, indicating flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter with my own offer. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's room for negotiation, as Bob clearly expresses interest in the product and is willing to pay more than his initial assessment.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides me with a solid backup option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired value, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $10,500, the product represents a significant value for him.
* **Positive Framing:** The ""split the difference"" approach encourages a sense of fairness and cooperation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! We've reached a mutually agreeable price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to carefully consider my next move. I might make another counteroffer, or I might decide to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While $10,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to pay more than his initial assessment. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  As always, John's offer of $15,000 provides me with a solid backup option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired value, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,250 is still a bit below where I need to be.

Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise from my previous offer ($10,500) to $10,400. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $10,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no higher. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.
