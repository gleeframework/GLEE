Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a significant saving compared to your guaranteed sale price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and framing this as a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
