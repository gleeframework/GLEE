{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but it also leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting Bob's previous interest, hoping to build rapport and encourage a positive response.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a win-win situation. I want to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible, but also want to make the deal attractive enough for Bob to consider.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth pursuing further or if I'm better off going with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still far below what I'm hoping to get. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,500?  That's a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting the discount:**  I'm emphasizing the discount from my original offer to make the new price seem more attractive.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving a small buffer for further negotiation, hoping to get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* By offering a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value, I'm increasing the likelihood that he'll accept.
* If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or to sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000 as a final offer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $10,000, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Even though Bob is calling it his final offer, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.

**Conclusion:**

* I've reached the point where it's more beneficial to sell the product to John and secure the higher price."
