"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,500?  That's a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves some room for negotiation.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000 as a final offer.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested, as this is my last offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $10,000, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
