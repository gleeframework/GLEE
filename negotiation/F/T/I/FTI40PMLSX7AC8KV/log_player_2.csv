"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is only $100,000 above Bob's maximum value, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there. Given my valuation of the product, I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to his target, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price.  While he could buy from John, this offer still represents a saving of $75,000 compared to John's price, so it's worth seeing if he can get closer to his target with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility.  I'm prepared to go up to $975,000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, there's still a $50,000 gap.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get closer.  He's still saving money compared to buying from John, so the risk of getting a worse offer is mitigated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  That's my maximum, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to your maximum, but I'm still not willing to sell at $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,075,000, which is $75,000 above Bob's maximum.  While there are still two rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to Bob's target price. 

At this point, Bob is better off buying from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees he gets the product at his maximum price and avoids the risk of getting a worse offer from Alice in the remaining rounds."
