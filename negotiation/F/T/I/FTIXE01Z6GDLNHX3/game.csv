"I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can offer you $7,000. That's a fair offer, considering the market value and my own limitations.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I have a strict budget. I can increase my offer slightly to $7,500, but that's the absolute maximum I can go.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $7,500 is still below my minimum. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
