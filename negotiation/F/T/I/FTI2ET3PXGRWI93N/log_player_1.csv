Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. Ideally, you want to get as close to this as possible.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to test Bob's willingness to pay, but not so high that it seems completely unreasonable. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **High but Justifiable Price:** $1,900,000 is a significant markup, but you're leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the ""returns"" Bob will gain attempts to anchor his perception of the product's value above $1,500,000.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob will likely counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate down, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Reactions:** Pay close attention to Bob's responses throughout the negotiation to get a sense of his willingness to pay.
* **Don't Reveal Your Backup Plan:** Never let Bob know about your deal with John. Your leverage depends on Bob believing this is his only chance to buy."
