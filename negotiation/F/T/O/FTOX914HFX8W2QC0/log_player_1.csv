Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to act quickly.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit,  a price too far above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) might discourage him completely. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your fallback is selling to John for $12,000."
