"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell it for that price yet. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm reducing my price a bit to $160. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  I'm hoping this will be closer to a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price. It's worth trying to get closer to my $150 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. I'm willing to sell to John for this price, so it's a reasonable offer. If Bob rejects again, I'll likely have to sell to John."
