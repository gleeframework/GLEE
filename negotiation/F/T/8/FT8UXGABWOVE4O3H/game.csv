,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $105 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $95. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $100. That's my absolute bottom line. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save a bit more.",92.0,Bob,6,
