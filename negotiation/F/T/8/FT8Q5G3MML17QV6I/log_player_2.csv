"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get the price lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting me halfway, and $11,500 is a reasonable price. It's not worth risking going higher or potentially losing the deal by going back and forth further."
