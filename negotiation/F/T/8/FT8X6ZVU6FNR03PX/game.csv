"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my bottom line.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
