"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to make you a one-time offer to purchase the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
