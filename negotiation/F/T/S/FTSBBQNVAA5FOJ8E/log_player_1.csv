"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  $17,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Confidence:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and my confidence in the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If he accepts, I've successfully closed the deal.
* If the negotiation stalls or doesn't seem promising, I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I get my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired value but still lower than my initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reduced price:** I'm reducing my initial price from $17,000 to $15,500, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $15,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Fairness emphasis:**  My message emphasizes the fairness of my counteroffer, considering the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully closed the deal.
* If he rejects, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

* **Risk of Stalemate:**  There's a risk that the negotiation could stall and result in a lower price or a failed deal altogether.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value of $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I've decided to take the guaranteed outcome and sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
