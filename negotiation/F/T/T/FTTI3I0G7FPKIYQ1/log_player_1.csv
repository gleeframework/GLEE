Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **Framing the Offer:** I emphasize the value to Bob and position the offer as a great opportunity for him. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below my initial offer of $1,400,000.  Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum and potentially secure a better price than selling to John. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if he doesn't meet my price expectations. This creates leverage in the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's initial offer but showing I'm open to negotiation.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $1,300,000, a midpoint between our previous offers, presents a compromise that appears fair. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, reminding Bob that I have options (John) if this deal doesn't work out. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and encouraging, promoting a collaborative approach to finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Improvement:** While I'm closer to my goal, there's still room for further negotiation.  A counteroffer could potentially lead to a better deal.
* **Leveraging John:**  Remembering that John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and push for a higher price.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate to make a deal and am willing to walk away unless my price expectations are met. This helps me gain leverage in the negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but signaling that I'm open to negotiation and willing to find a middle ground.
* **Compromise:** Offering $1,350,000 is a compromise, showing a willingness to move towards Bob's price while staying above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, reminding Bob that I have options (John) if this deal doesn't work out.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still significantly below it. 
* **Time is Money:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Continuing could drag things out and potentially lead to more rejections, costing me valuable time.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  
* **Limited Leverage:** Even if I counteroffer, I'm not sure how much more leverage I have. Bob has shown he's unwilling to go much higher. 

In this situation, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed deal with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
