Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives Bob a good deal, as it's lower than what he values the product at, but it also gives me a good profit margin, ensuring I earn more than my minimum desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $140. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $132 is still a good profit margin for me. It's also getting closer to my desired price range, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
