"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it then.",100.0,Bob,4,
