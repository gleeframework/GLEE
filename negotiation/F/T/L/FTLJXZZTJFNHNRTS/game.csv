"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects the significant value this product brings.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget.  Let's try $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
