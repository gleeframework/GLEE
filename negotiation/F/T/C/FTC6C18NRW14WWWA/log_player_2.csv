"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $115, which is still within your budget.
* However, you are trying to save as much money as possible.
* You can get the product from John for $120, but Alice is offering it for $115. 
* It makes sense to try and get a better price from Alice, even if it means potentially paying a bit more from John.
* Therefore, you should reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with her."
