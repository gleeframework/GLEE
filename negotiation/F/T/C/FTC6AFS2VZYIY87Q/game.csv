"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, considering my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1400000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to make this deal work.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. However, based on my current financial situation, I can only consider offers around $1200000. Could we possibly reach an agreement at that price point?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I need to be realistic.  While I appreciate your persistence, $1200000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at $1250000 to make this work.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
