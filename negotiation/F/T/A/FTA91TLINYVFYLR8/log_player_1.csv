{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. I'm curious to see if Bob is interested in this initial offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum price. While I could accept it, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. Hopefully, this is a price that is appealing to him while still getting me closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it."
