"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to give myself room to negotiate down. This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,400,000, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I want to remind Bob of the product's value to him ($1,500,000) without explicitly mentioning that figure. My message subtly implies this by emphasizing the product's potential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my target price and his perceived value of the product.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Flexibility (Slightly):** In the next round, I can counter with an offer slightly above my minimum ($1,200,000) to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain a Stronger Position:**  By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at any price, potentially encouraging Bob to increase his offer further in subsequent rounds. 

I believe there's still room for negotiation before resorting to selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  By reducing my price by $75,000, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Holding Firm (For Now):** However, my counteroffer remains significantly above both my minimum and his initial offer. This keeps the pressure on Bob to move closer to my target. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce why my price is justified.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:**  The ""meet in the middle"" approach can be psychologically effective in negotiations, making it seem like a fair deal to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk:

* **Stalemate:**  Bob might be firm on his $1,200,000 offer, leading to a stalemate and potentially a worse outcome for me. 
* **Losing the Deal:**  Pushing too hard could lead Bob to walk away, leaving me to sell to John at the same price anyway.

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, securing a reasonable profit without risking the deal's collapse."
