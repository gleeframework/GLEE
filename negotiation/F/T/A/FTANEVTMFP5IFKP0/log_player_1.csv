"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal. I'll be ready to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see where Bob stands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not going to accept that. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit to be more competitive, but still aiming for a profit.  I think $150 is a fair price considering my minimum value and Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $130. This is still above my minimum value of $120, but it's a significant concession from my previous offer, showing my willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway at this price."
