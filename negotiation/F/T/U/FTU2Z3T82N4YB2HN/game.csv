"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned and my budget constraints. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
