"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer.  While I appreciate that price, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
