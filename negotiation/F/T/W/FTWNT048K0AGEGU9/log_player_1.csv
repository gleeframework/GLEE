"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal since it's lower than the product's worth to him. I'm also being friendly and encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not going to accept it just yet.  The product is worth more to me than $100, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  While $100 is my minimum, I can't accept that just yet.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can still reach a compromise. Would it be possible to lower the price to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $112.50? That way we're both closer to what we want."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
