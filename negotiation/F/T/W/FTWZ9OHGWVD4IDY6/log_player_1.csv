{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which is 20% above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation but also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and straightforward, focusing on the value to Bob. This helps build rapport and avoids any potential tension.
* **Backup plan:** I am aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob become too difficult. 

**Next steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm offering $900000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I want for the product. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe there's still room for a more favorable deal. I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 just yet. 
* **Sell to John is a last resort:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob.

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer and my initial offer. I'll keep in mind that John is always a backup option if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects both the product's value to you and my need to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to find a solution.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a logical explanation for the price, highlighting both the product's value and my need for profit.
* **Open for discussion:** The message remains friendly and ends with an open-ended question to encourage further conversation.

**Next steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any). If he doesn't accept, I'll consider a lower counteroffer or selling to John depending on the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not yet willing to settle for less than $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I believe there's still room for a more favorable deal. I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob.
* **Selling to John is a close call:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a very tempting option, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob. However, I'm approaching the point where selling to John is becoming more appealing.

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price.  I'll be more aggressive with my counteroffer, but I'll keep in mind that John is always a backup option if the negotiations fail. I'll also have to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not a feasible price for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Minimum Price:**  I'm holding firm at my minimum price of $1,000,000, emphasizing the value proposition to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm reminding Bob of my alternative option (selling to John) to increase the pressure. 

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll move forward with selling to John, as the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high."
