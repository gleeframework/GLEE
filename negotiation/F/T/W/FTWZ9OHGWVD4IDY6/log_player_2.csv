"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm offering $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price reflects both the product's value to you and my need to make a profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my limit."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to go up to $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still not a feasible price for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my budget limit. While I would have preferred a lower price, it's a fair deal considering the product's value to me. It's more beneficial to accept the offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
