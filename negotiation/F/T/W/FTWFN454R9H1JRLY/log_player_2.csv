Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $9,500 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's try to find common ground.
