"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm sure you understand the value of this product and its potential to benefit your business.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $850000. This price is still a significant discount from the value it holds for you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $800000. Would you be willing to consider $820000? I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product.",820000.0,Bob,4,
