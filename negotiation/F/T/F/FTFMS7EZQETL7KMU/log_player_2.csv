"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate to try to reach a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $13,500. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $14,500. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's tempting to accept as it's closer to Bob's goal, the better strategy is to continue negotiating.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob may be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $14,500 is still above what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit. With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to be strategic. 

It's worth continuing to negotiate, as Bob might be able to push Alice further down to his desired price range.  If he rejects, he can make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we've both made concessions, and I appreciate that. I'm really only able to go up to $13,250.  It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go below $14,000, Bob. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you at $13,750. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a critical moment in the negotiation. While Alice has come down to $13,750, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He has one round left, and it's highly unlikely Alice will budge any further.

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal with John for $12,000. It saves him money compared to accepting Alice's offer and ensures he gets the product without risking further negotiation."
