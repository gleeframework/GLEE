"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product that I believe would be a significant asset to your operations.  I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's mutually beneficial.  My asking price is $950,000.  This represents a significant savings for you, and it ensures I receive a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, you know you have an alternative seller (John) willing to sell for $1,000,000. This gives you bargaining power. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you create an opportunity:

* **Alice might lower her price:**  She knows her alternative is you going to John.
* **You can negotiate:** You can counter-offer with a price lower than $950,000, aiming for a better deal.

It makes sense to see if you can get the product for a price closer to $800,000 before resorting to John."
