Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000.  This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, he has an incentive to negotiate.  If he rejects my offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me, considering the product is worth $10,000 to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement closer to this price, but I'm also prepared to consider selling to John if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price of $10,000.  It's not ideal, but it's a fair price, and it avoids the risk of having to negotiate further with Bob or selling to John.  I'm accepting his offer."
