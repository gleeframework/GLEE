"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to establish a much lower starting point.  It's a significant jump, but it leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying at a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. I'll counter-offer again to see if there's more wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $10,750?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

This counter-offer shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price point while still pushing for a better deal.  We're narrowing the gap, and it keeps the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $11,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close!  Alice is clearly motivated to sell, but there's still a chance to negotiate a bit further down before I consider taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,200 is tempting, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you consider $10,900? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10900
}
```

We're in the later stages of negotiation now.  This offer splits the difference while still aiming for a price below $11,000. It conveys a sense of urgency and willingness to close the deal soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment and offer it to you for $11,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While I could push for another $100, it's unlikely she'll go much lower, and it's a good price compared to John's offer.  $11,100 is a reasonable compromise to secure the product."
