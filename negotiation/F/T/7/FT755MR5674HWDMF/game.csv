"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to buy it for $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can do $150, which is the lowest I can go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we settle on $155? It's a fair price, and I think you'll love the product",155.0,Alice,5,
