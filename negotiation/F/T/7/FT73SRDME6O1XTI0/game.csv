"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. ",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my target. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's aim for a price of $1,050,000. This price reflects a compromise that benefits both of us and brings us closer to a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you further in the middle, and I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This offer reflects a significant discount from your initial price and is a price I'm confident you'll find acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to maximize the value of the product. Considering the value it holds for you and the market demand, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any value on the table. Let's aim for a price of $1,025,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to maximize value, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering $1,010,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1010000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you and the market demand, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $1,015,000, but this is my last offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
