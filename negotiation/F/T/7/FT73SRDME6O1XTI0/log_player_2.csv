Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to maximize the value of the product. Considering the value it holds for you and the market demand, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any value on the table. Let's aim for a price of $1,025,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $1,025,000 is still above your desired price point. There's room for further negotiation, and you should try to get closer to $1,000,000 before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to maximize value, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering $1,010,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1010000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you and the market demand, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $1,015,000, but this is my last offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,015,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $1,010,000.  It's likely you won't get a better price from Alice, and you only have 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer to save time and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
