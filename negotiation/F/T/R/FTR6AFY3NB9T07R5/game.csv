"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. The product is truly worth more, and I'm confident its value will become even clearer to you.  I'm willing to compromise, but my counteroffer is $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,
