"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm starting at $90, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $82.50 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to pay $80 for the product, which is fair for both of us and lets us close the deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me, as it meets my minimum acceptable price. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer or have to sell to John for the same price."
