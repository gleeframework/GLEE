,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $82.50 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to pay $80 for the product, which is fair for both of us and lets us close the deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",80.0,Bob,4,
