Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $14,000, knowing the product is worth more to Bob ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Leaving Room:**  A $1,000 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value allows for potential compromise.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $10,000 means I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me bargaining power. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll observe Bob's response.
* If he accepts, great!  I've secured a good price.
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $12,500 is still above my minimum of $10,000, it's significantly lower than my initial offer of $14,000.  I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm not willing to accept such a big drop in price.
* **I have leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me the confidence to reject and counteroffer.  
* **Room for compromise:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $13,000 or $13,500. 
* If he rejects, I'll have to evaluate the situation and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and  Appeal:** I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($12,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a good price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not immediately accepting his offer, I maintain some leverage and avoid appearing desperate.
* **Final Attempt:** This counteroffer represents my final attempt to negotiate a mutually beneficial price before considering selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response. 
* If he accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If he rejects, I will sell the product to John, as my goal is to maximize my earnings, and I'm not willing to accept any price lower than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's latest offer of $12,000 is lower than my counteroffer of $13,500. It seems we've reached an impasse, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price for me.
* **Securing the Minimum:** John's offer of $10,000 represents my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer a higher amount, selling to John guarantees a safe and secure transaction.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations risks further delays, and the time spent could be better used pursuing other opportunities.

**Final Decision:**

Selling to John at $10,000 is the most pragmatic decision. It ensures a timely sale and guarantees a minimum return on my product. I am satisfied with this outcome, as it aligns with my goal of maximizing my earnings."
