"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay under $12,000. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
