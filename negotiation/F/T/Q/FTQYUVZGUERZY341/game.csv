,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $135. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can go down to $130, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Is $130 a price you'd be willing to pay?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130. Would you consider selling the product to me for $127.50?",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can get any closer to the price I'm looking for than $135, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. Is $135 still not a price you're willing to pay?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $132, but that's as low as I can go. Please consider this offer, as I'm getting close to walking away from the deal and buying from John for $100.",132.0,Bob,8,
