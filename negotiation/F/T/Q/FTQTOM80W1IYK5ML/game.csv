"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $12500, which is a significant amount. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $13500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns about the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'm willing to go up to $13200, but no higher. Can you consider that?",13200.0,Bob,6,
