"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [Product Name]. It's a rare find with tremendous potential. My asking price is $1200000, reflecting its value and the potential it holds. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob. Alice's offer is too high.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This reflects a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $900000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me to accept at this time. Given the product's unique qualities and the value it represents, I believe $1000000 would be a fair compromise. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay. Since Bob can buy the product from John for the same price, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice. It saves time and effort compared to further negotiations."
