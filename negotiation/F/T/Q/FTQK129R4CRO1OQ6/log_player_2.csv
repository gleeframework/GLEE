"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth $8,000 to you, but it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
