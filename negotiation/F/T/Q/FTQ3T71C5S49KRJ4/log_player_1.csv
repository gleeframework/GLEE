Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $14000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $14,000. I have several rounds left and want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13250 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $12750.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $12,750 is a decent compromise and gets me significantly closer to my desired outcome.  It's also getting late in the negotiations, and I want to avoid risking losing out on this deal completely."
