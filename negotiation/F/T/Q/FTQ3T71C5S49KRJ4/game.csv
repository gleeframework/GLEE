"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $14000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13250 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $12750.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
