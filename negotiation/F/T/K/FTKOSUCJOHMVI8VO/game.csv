"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $150 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $135?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
