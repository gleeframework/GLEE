Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but $1,625,000 is still a bit below my target.  Let's compromise again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.

With only four rounds left, and Bob's offer being the closest he's come to my desired price, I'm going to accept his offer.  I can still make a decent profit, and there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer in the remaining rounds."
