"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to reach a compromise. This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1250000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1250000 is closer to my ideal price, it still falls short of what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but $1350000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1275000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make a final concession to reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1275000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1325000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $1325000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1260000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1260000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1260000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product.  Considering the value it holds for you and the limited time remaining, I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it for $1300000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If we can't agree, I'll have to accept John's offer of $1500000.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1300000. I've already stretched my budget to its limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I think $1200000 is the maximum I can pay, and I hope you can understand my position.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
