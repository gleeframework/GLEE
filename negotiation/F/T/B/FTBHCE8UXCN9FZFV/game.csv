"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",11250.0,Alice,5,
