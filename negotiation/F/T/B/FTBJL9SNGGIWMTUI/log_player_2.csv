Round 9

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to negotiate with Alice before having to buy from John. Alice's offer is only $75 higher than Bob's last counteroffer and only $925 higher than his initial target price.  He's likely to save more money by accepting Alice's offer than buying from John. This is a good compromise that allows both parties to close the deal."
