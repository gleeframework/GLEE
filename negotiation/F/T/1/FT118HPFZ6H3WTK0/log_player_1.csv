Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to find a workable agreement, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for you. Let's meet in the middle - how about $950,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is substantial, and I need to ensure a fair deal.  Would you be willing to consider $875,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are continuing to make progress. $875,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. To be upfront, I have an alternative option at $800,000.  If you could meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my absolute bottom line. While I could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk he won't budge further and I'd lose the deal. Accepting $800,000 now secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
