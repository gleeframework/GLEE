"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? It's still a great price for a product worth so much to you. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant price for me, and I'd be ready to close the deal today.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal today.",8250.0,Alice,5,
