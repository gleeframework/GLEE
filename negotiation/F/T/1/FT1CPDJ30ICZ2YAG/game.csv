"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a significant discount. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,750 just doesn't cut it for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,875? It's a fair price that's closer to your budget, and gives me a better deal than I've been offered so far.  Let's make this happen!",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. However, $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm willing to make a decision today if we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and I'm ready to make a deal. However, $8,750 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,812.50? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's close this deal today!",8812.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,8,
