"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,600,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,625,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1625000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,625,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with my original offer of $1,600,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,625,000, the negotiation seems to be stuck at $1,600,000. It's a good price, considering John is only offering $1,500,000, and we're nearing the end of the rounds. Accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy at this point."
