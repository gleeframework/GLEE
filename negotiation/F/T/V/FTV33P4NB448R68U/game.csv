"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This would represent a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
