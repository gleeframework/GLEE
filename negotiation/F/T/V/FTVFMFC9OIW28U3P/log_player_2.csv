"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $100 and Alice is offering it for $95.  While this is a discount, it's still higher than what you'd pay John ($100).  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
