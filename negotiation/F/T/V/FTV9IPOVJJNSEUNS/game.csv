"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price still provides you with a significant value, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your proposal, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'd like to suggest a price of $10,000 for your product. I hope this is within your range and still offers good value for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
