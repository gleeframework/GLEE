Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000 is a starting point:**  It's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, giving me some room to negotiate. 
* **The message is friendly and focuses on value:**  I highlight the product's benefits and try to build rapport with Bob. 
* **I'm prepared to negotiate:** I'm not going to be stubborn with my initial offer, but I'm also not going to give away the farm.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. Could you perhaps lower the price a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  Accepting it would leave me with a loss. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm also confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or at least a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is just too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I've lowered my price from $15,000 to $13,000, showing flexibility. 
* **Focus on value and compromise:**  I remind Bob of the product's value and emphasize that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I want to keep the negotiation friendly and open the door for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I am proposing $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable value. While I'd prefer to get more, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round. Accepting his offer secures my minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
