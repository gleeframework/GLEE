"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my value and your need to sell. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,300,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to accept $1,375,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,5,
