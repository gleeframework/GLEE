"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The offer of $120 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $80. It's more strategic to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still within Bob's budget. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $110 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate for a better price. There are still several rounds left, so there's time to potentially get a more favorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're willing to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about $95?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise, but is still pushing for a price closer to his target.  $95 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you at $100. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm not quite ready to go that low. I can offer it to you for $105. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the lowest she's gone so far, $105 is still above Bob's budget of $80. Bob can do better.  It's important to remember that Bob can always buy from John for $80, so there's no need to settle for a price above that. The negotiation is progressing, and there are still several rounds left to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you getting closer to my price range, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, and I think that's a fair price considering how much we've both moved. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is a significant move towards Alice's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.  This offer is also reasonable considering Alice's own valuation of the product at $100. There's a chance Alice will accept this offer, but if not, there's still room for further negotiation."
