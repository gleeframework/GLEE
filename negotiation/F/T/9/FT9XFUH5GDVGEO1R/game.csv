"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
