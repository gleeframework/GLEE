"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,500.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go to $10,750 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise from my original position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
