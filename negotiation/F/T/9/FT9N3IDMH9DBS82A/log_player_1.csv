{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value ($12,000) but above Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I'm establishing myself as the seller with the upper hand, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer:**  I keep John's offer in mind, knowing I have a guaranteed backup option if the deal with Bob falls through. 

I'm open to adjusting this strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider factors like his counteroffer, my time constraints, and the likelihood of getting a better price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. By rejecting, I signal that I'm willing to walk away, increasing the pressure on Bob to make a more reasonable offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still slightly below John's offer to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,500.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my minimum acceptable value and Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By offering a price slightly above Bob's initial offer, I'm still conveying that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm remaining aware of John's offer and would be willing to walk away if Bob doesn't make a more reasonable offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer again, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or simply move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below my $12,000 goal.
* **John's Offer is Superior:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a better financial outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of wasting time and potentially reaching a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob one more time, offering a price slightly above his current offer but still below John's offer. This will be my final attempt to get a better deal from Bob before moving on to John.  If Bob rejects my final counteroffer, I will sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go to $10,750 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise from my original position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final counteroffer, designed to push Bob closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  By offering $10,750, I'm essentially meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous counteroffer.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The message emphasizes that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm prepared to accept John's offer if Bob rejects this counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I will sell the product to John. If he accepts, I will finalize the transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer is Superior:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a much better financial outcome than accepting Bob's final offer of $10,500.
* **Stalemate:**  Negotiations with Bob have reached a stalemate.  His offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm unwilling to go any lower. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and effort without any guarantee of a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale of the product to him."
