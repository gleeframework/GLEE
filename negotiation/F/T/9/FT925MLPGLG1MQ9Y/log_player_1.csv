Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer allows you to acquire it at a price below its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below this price maximizes potential profit from Bob.
* **Create Urgency:** By highlighting that the offer is below the product's ""true worth,"" I aim to create a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob. 

It's unlikely Bob will accept a price higher than his perceived value of $12,000, but this offer leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price."
