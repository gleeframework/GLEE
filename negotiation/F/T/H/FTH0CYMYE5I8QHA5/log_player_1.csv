Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm looking for a price of $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a significantly higher price ($18,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a much higher profit.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will give me valuable information about his perception of the product's value. 
* **Alternative Option:** I am aware that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000. This gives me leverage and the confidence to start high and walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still a significant profit above my minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I value your offer, I'm looking for something closer to $15,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you at that price."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $15,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price point and potentially sway Bob's perception.
* **Maintaining Balance:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active while still leaving room for further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $13,500 represents a $3,500 profit, which is significant and surpasses my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. Accepting now avoids the risk of him walking away if I push for a higher price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could try to negotiate further, the potential gain is unlikely to outweigh the risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely. Accepting his offer secures a good deal now."
