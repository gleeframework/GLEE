Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a price that is lower than Bob's estimated value of $1,200,000, making it attractive to him.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and respectful, while also clearly stating my offer and inviting Bob to respond.

This approach allows for potential negotiation while still securing a good price, ensuring I am not simply taking John's offer if Bob rejects my first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'm aiming for a higher price, and by rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially reach a better agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This will allow for further negotiation without risking selling for a lower price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. It also emphasizes that the proposed price is a fair compromise. 

By offering a counter-offer closer to my desired price, I'm increasing the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement without having to accept a lower price or resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a bit lower than my ideal price, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Given that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price and that I have a backup option of selling to John for $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer is a reasonable decision. 

It ensures a sale at a decent price while minimizing the risk of the negotiation dragging on and potentially losing both Bob and John as buyers."
