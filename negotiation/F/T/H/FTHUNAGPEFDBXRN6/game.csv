"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still a bit below my target price. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I agree it's a valuable product, I'm working with a tighter budget. How about $775,000? That's a significant step up from my last offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $775,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
