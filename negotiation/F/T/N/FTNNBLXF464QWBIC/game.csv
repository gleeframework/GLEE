"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $650,000 is still too far from what I can accept. Let's try $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
