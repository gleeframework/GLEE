"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on the benefits for Bob, framing it as a win-win situation. 
* **Strategy:** My goal is to see if Bob is willing to engage in negotiations. If he rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is way too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
*  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I can sell the product to John for a much higher amount.  
* **Next Round Strategy:**  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to get Bob to come up to a more reasonable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving a significant profit margin for myself.  
* **Message:**  I'm staying firm but trying to be persuasive by emphasizing fairness and offering a compromise.
* **Strategy:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to move closer to my price range. If he rejects again, I'll consider lowering the price a bit more, but I'll still be careful not to get too close to his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is a bit higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and below the value I know the product holds. 
* **My Strategy:** I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my target, but still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Risk Assessment:** I'm aware of the risk of losing the deal if I keep rejecting offers. However, I'm confident that I can find a middle ground with Bob that's more favorable to me. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $650,000 is still too far from what I can accept. Let's try $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $800,000. This is the exact value Bob places on the product, meaning he is potentially willing to pay this price. It's a significant drop from my previous offer but still above his current offer.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a fair deal. I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to consider the value he places on the product.
* **Strategy:**  My goal is to push Bob towards my target price range.  If he accepts, I've secured a decent profit. If he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll be more cautious about lowering my price.

**Important Note:** While I'm offering Bob a price that's equal to his perceived value, I'm still aiming for a profit. My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000. I'm using this negotiation to try and maximize my earnings while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
