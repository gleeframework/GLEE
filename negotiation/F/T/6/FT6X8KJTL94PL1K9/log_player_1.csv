Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I also have the option to go with John's offer of $10,000 at any time, giving me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower than $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise from my original offer and should be more appealing to Bob, while still giving me a good profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider lowering my price a bit more, but I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's $10,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's lower than I initially hoped, it's still a good deal for me, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000. I'm willing to close the deal at $11,500 and avoid further negotiation."
