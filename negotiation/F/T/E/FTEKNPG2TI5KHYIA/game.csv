"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product.  I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  the price you're offering is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1,500,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
