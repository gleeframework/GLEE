Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  the price you're offering is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?

Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to go higher and I already have John offering my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on."
