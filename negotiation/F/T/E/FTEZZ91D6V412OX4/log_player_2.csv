"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's currently priced at $12,000, which is a significant discount considering its worth to me. I believe this offer represents a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth to her, John offers the same product for a lower price of $10,000.  Since my goal is to save money, buying from John is the best choice."
