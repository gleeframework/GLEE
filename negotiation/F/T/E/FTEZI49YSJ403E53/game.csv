"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you highlighting the potential value of this product.  However, $1500000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1000000 is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's compromise at $1250000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
