"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to him and at least $80 to me. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $90.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with his offer.  I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm dropping my price to $87. This is getting close to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I hope Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $83 is getting very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale completely. It's better to accept this offer and move on."
