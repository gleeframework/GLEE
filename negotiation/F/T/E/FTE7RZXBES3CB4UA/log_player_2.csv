"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think is a great value for both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get an even lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm hoping we can find a price closer to $8,500. That would make it a real win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, but I have to make a living, too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. How about we compromise at $9,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is still better than John's $12,000,  Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. There's still room for negotiation to get the price closer to his desired $8,500.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,800 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would allow both of us to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I can see you're willing to negotiate, so I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $9,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $8,500 and a better deal than John's $12,000.  While there is still a potential for further negotiation,  Bob is getting closer to his goal. Accepting the offer would be a good decision at this point.  There is always a risk of Alice rejecting a future counteroffer, and that could potentially lead to Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
