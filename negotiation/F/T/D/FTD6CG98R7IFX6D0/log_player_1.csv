Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, still landing Alice a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has a strong fallback with John ($1,000,000), giving her leverage to stick to a higher price with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This offer assumes no prior knowledge about Bob's negotiating style. If Bob is known to be extremely price-sensitive, Alice might adjust her offer slightly lower.
* **Urgency:** If Alice needs to sell the product quickly, she might be more willing to accept a slightly lower offer from Bob to avoid the risk of him rejecting it."
