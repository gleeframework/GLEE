,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I believe this price still represents great value for you.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price to close this deal, but it needs to be above $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,150.  This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000",9500.0,Bob,6,
