"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm confident it could be worth significantly more to the right buyer. If you're interested, let's discuss further.  If not, I have another interested party ready to buy it at my minimum price.",15000.0,Alice,1,
