Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a strong safety net. Alice should aim high initially.
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value proposition:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition."" While not explicitly stating the value to Bob, it aims to frame the product as highly desirable.

This strategy attempts to maximize profit while leaving open the possibility of securing a deal with Bob."
