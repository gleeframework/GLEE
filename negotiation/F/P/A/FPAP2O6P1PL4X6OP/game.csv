"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value might be high, but given my current budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $800000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. If this is still not acceptable, I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to let you know that I have another interested buyer who is willing to meet my minimum price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1050000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is enough. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is as low as I can go without compromising my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get to a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $1180000. This is my final concession, and I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1180000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. However, I've made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at a price that's closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer who is willing to meet my minimum price.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
