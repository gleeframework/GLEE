"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $145. Can you meet me at $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding the value you place on it. While we aim to accommodate all our customers, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $70. Our product's unique features and high-quality craftsmanship justify a price point of $145. However, I would like to propose a compromise at $120, which still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a great deal. I hope this meets within your budget considerations.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for quality, but I've set a budget of $80 for this purchase. Can you meet me at $90? I'm willing to make a decision today, and I think $90 is a fair price for this product.",90.0,Bob,4,
