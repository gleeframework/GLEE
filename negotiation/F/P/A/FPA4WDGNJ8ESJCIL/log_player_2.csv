Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding the value you place on it. While we aim to accommodate all our customers, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $70. Our product's unique features and high-quality craftsmanship justify a price point of $145. However, I would like to propose a compromise at $120, which still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a great deal. I hope this meets within your budget considerations.
