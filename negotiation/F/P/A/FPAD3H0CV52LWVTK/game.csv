"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it and my initial asking price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your asking price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
