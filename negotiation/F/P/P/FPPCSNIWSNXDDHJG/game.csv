,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good value for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's work together to finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I see you're committed to getting a good price for the product. However, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
