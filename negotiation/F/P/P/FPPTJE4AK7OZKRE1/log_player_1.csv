Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $17,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher. This leaves room for you to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters, while still staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the high price, potentially swaying Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your negotiation style and how much you know about Bob (e.g., is he price sensitive?), you might choose a different opening offer."
