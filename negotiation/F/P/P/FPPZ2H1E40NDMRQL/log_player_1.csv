Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $12,000.  This is a great deal considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $8,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible without alienating Bob. 
* **The Offer:**  $12,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum, leaving both parties with a potential surplus.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach balances several factors:

* **Greed vs. Risk:**  Asking for the full $15,000 is risky. Bob might reject it, forcing you to accept the lower offer from John.
* **Fairness:** A price closer to the middle ground can be perceived as more reasonable, potentially increasing the chance of Bob accepting.

It's a negotiation, and this starting point gives you room to potentially go even lower if needed, while still aiming for a strong profit."
