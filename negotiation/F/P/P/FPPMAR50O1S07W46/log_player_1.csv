Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. I am willing to pay $14,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $14,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $15,000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. I've gotten my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that if I continue negotiating, Bob might not be willing to go higher."
