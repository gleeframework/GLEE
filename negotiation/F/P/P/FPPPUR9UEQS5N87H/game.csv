"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to negotiate a price that benefits us both. My minimum price is $800,000, but I'm open to hearing your offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I have another buyer ready to purchase at $800,000. Let's see if we can create a win-win situation.",900000.0,Alice,1,
