Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower, starting near your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and alternative buyers, creating a sense of urgency and scarcity. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then decide if you want to negotiate further or move on to John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price than John's offer makes it worth the attempt."
