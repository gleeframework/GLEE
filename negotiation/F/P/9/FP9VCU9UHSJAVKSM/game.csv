"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1150000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1150000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1100000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to offer $1125000. This is a good price for both of us, and it's closer to where we both want to be.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1200000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, so I'm thinking of a price of $1190000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this point.",1190000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I'm closer, $1190000 is still a bit high.  Let's meet halfway again.  I'll offer $1175000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
