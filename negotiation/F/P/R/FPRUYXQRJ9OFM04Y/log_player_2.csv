{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above my maximum limit. Although we are close, I don't want to risk going over my budget and continuing to negotiate.  John's offer of $800,000 is within my budget, and it's better to close the deal with him rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
