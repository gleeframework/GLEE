Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit above that number. I can offer you a slight discount to $8,500, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000. It makes more sense to take the sure thing and save $500."
