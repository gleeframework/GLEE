"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be comfortable paying $850,000. Let me know if you're open to that.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price, considering it's closer to my budget and still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
