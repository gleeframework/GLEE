"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay $100 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $100.  Since you have the option of buying from John for the same price, there's no immediate advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting gives you the potential to negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
