"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,350,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not comfortable with $1,350,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is still worth $1,200,000 to Bob and Alice is offering $1,250,000, it's still a bit above Bob's target price.  It's better to try for a lower price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my target price. How about $1,225,000?  This is closer to my budget and hopefully a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
