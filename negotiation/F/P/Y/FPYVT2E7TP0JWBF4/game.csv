"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $8,200?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go right now.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  $8,200 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for something a little closer to my original asking price.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $8,300 for the product. This is my final offer.",8300.0,Alice,5,
