"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's a price I can work with.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
