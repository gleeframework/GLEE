"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $115.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $125. That's the lowest I can go, Bob. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit more than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $120,  Let's see if we can finalize this.",120.0,Bob,6,

"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $120, Bob! I think we can do even better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",130.0,Alice,7,
