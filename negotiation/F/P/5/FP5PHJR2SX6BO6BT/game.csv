"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested, or we can end the negotiations here.",135.0,Alice,5,
