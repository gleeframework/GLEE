"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $175 is way above his $100 limit.  He's better off trying to negotiate a lower price or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his target. He should keep negotiating.  There's still room for Alice to come down further, and he can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested, or we can end the negotiations here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  He's only willing to spend $100, and Alice's offer is $135, which is outside his budget.  While there's still a chance he could negotiate Alice down further, it's risky.  John offers a guaranteed price within his budget, so it's the safer and more efficient choice."
