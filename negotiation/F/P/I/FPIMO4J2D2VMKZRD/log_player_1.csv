"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer meets my minimum value, I'm not eager to accept it right away. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to explore that before settling for the bare minimum.  I'll proceed to the next round and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,250,000, which is above my minimum value and a better deal than John is offering. Given that we have already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob's offer is reasonable, I'm going to accept it."
