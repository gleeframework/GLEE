"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. How about we settle on $950,000? This price allows for both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $900,000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal where we both walk away feeling good about the transaction. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
