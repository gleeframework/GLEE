Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and leaves some room for negotiation.  It's also lower than the product's worth to Bob, making it a potentially attractive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering the product for $135.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It's still a good deal for me and potentially a good deal for Bob since he's clearly willing to pay more than $130."
