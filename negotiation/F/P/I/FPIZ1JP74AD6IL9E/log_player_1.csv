"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm starting with an offer of $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Being friendly and optimistic can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Stating that I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. This is important in building a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price,  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob right away. I believe there's room for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore a price closer to my initial offer.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still a chance that Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if I counter with a price that's still above my minimum.
* **Exploring Options:** It's worth exploring further negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I can come down to $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price, showing flexibility.
* **Reasonable Price:** $9,000 is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Open to Finalization:**  I'm encouraging Bob to reach an agreement, suggesting a finality to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Can you meet me at $8500? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not desperate. There's a chance to get a slightly better price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price that's closer to $9,000, which might be more palatable to Bob.
* **Avoiding Quick Sale:** Selling to John right now would mean leaving money on the table. I want to see if I can push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on the budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows a genuine effort to find a middle ground.
* **Fair Price Justification:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price for both parties, making it less about just my profit and more about finding a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""close this deal"" to encourage Bob to make a decision and avoid further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Can you meet me at $8250? I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum of $8,000, I still have a few rounds left and want to see if I can squeeze out a little more.
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to $8,500.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John would secure my minimum, but it also means potentially missing out on a slightly better price. The risk of continuing the negotiation seems worth the potential reward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $8,500, which is a fair price for both of us. It's the best I can do, but I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making a final offer, indicating that I'm willing to go down to Bob's last offer but won't go any lower.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I reiterate the ""fairness"" of the price, emphasizing a win-win situation for both parties.
* **Confidence in Product:** I highlight the value and potential of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Limited Negotiation:** This shows a commitment to finalizing the deal, potentially pressuring Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Can you meet me at $8000? I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Reached:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, there's a risk of not being able to secure a better deal.
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** I've already compromised significantly, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a worse outcome.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal without having to resort to John's offer, which is my absolute minimum."
