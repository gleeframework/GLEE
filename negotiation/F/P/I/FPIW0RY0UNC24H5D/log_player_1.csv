Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position. However, being too greedy could make Bob walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward and highlights the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Alternative Implied:** While not explicitly mentioning John, the ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing subtly implies you have other options.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiating style."
