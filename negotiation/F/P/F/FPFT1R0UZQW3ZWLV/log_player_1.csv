{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a steal considering its true worth! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's a high price, but not outrageous. It allows for room to negotiate down if Bob counters. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $15,000 is a fair price, I need to make sure I get a return on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $16000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is above my minimum value of $15,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm happy to accept this offer and move forward with the sale."
