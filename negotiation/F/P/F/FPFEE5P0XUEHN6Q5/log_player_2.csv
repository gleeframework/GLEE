# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll go with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I believe the product is worth more to you than that, and I'm not getting the profit I need to make at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, as it's below my minimum price. If you're not willing to meet me at $1,075,000, I'll have to consider other options.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. Although it's close, I'm not willing to risk going higher and potentially paying more than I need to. John's offer guarantees me the product at my maximum price point.  It's time to move on and buy from John."
