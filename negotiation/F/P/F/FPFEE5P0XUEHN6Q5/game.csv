"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $1,000,000?  This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for that price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I believe the product is worth more to you than that, and I'm not getting the profit I need to make at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, as it's below my minimum price. If you're not willing to meet me at $1,075,000, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
