"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me at the moment. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I believe it's worth considering.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but $800,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'd rather not sell the product to you at this point. I think I'll consider other offers, including one from another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
