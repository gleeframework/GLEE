"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I believe it's worth considering.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sorry, Bob, but $800,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'd rather not sell the product to you at this point. I think I'll consider other offers, including one from another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is not willing to budge below $850,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000, it's best to take that deal and maximize your savings. Continuing negotiations with Alice is unlikely to result in a better outcome for you."
