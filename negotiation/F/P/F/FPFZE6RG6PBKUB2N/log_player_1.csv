"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not immediately giving away too much.
* **Positive Message:**  I'm framing the offer positively, highlighting the value to Bob, to encourage him to consider it seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for potential adjustments in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is a serious one, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

I'll proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects a significant discount and offers a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, trying to justify the price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message remains positive, emphasizing the opportunity and a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price is still above Bob's offer but allows for potential further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer, while a slight increase, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited Time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for a much higher price, providing me with strong leverage in negotiations.

I'll proceed to Round 5 and make a counteroffer to Bob.  I need to push closer to my desired price range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and reflects the value this product will bring to your business. Let's make this deal happen. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is a strong signal to Bob that I'm getting closer to my bottom line and won't budge much further.
* **High Stakes:** With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on Bob to make a decision.
* **Value Focus:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain by acquiring the product, trying to incentivize him to accept.
* **Strategic Compromise:** While I'm dropping my price a bit, I'm still holding out for a good deal closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds left, the time pressure is increasing.
* **Unfavorable Offer:** Bob's final offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, providing a secure and lucrative sale.

At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is too high.  I'm confident that selling to John will yield the highest profit and ensure a successful deal."
