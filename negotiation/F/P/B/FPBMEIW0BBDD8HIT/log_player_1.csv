"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This initial offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($12,000) but acknowledging Bob's lower valuation.  This leaves room for negotiation while still presenting a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to make a small concession this round but still want to remain above my minimum acceptable price.  By offering $11,000, I show a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10750? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, even though it is a better offer than the previous round. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's try $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a good compromise on my part.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer but still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
