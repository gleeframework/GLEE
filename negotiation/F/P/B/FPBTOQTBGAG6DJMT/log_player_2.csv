"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm sure you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above my desired price point.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll try to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to squeeze out a bit more savings by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,335,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations so far.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,335,000, which is only $10,000 more than my last counteroffer. At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially having Alice walk away or me needing to buy from John at a much higher price. I'll accept the offer and secure the product."
