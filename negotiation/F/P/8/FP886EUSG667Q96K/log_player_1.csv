Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Starting High:** A higher initial offer gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial limitations or how much he values the product beyond $10,000. If you had more information, you could potentially tailor your approach for a more successful negotiation."
