Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is a starting point. It's important to consider a few things:

* **My Goal:**  Maximize profit. Ideally, I'd want more than $1,000,000, but I need to be realistic. Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, so I need to ensure Bob's offer is better than that. 
* **Bob's Perspective:**  He values the product at $1,000,000, so he's likely to accept a price close to that. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'll need to assess Bob's reaction to this offer. If he counters, I'll adjust my strategy. I can either be more aggressive or try to meet him in the middle, depending on how much I want to push for a higher price. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not ready to pay $1000000 at this point.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $750000.  This is a fair price considering my own assessment of the value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than the guaranteed price from John. 
* **My Goal:**  I want to maximize profit.  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000.  Accepting Bob's offer would be a loss.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'll counter Bob's offer. I need to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and allows me to make a profit. I'll need to be strategic about how much I lower my price to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting. 

**Next Steps:**

1. I'll need to determine a counteroffer that is higher than $750,000 but lower than my initial $1,000,000.
2. I'll analyze Bob's offer:  Was he serious about $750,000, or is this just a starting point for negotiation? 
3. I'll prepare a message explaining my counteroffer, keeping in mind that I want to maintain a good relationship with Bob in case our negotiations continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm confident in the value of this product and believe a price closer to $900,000 would be more fair.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Goal:** My goal is to get as close to my initial asking price of $1,000,000 as possible while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Response:**  Bob's offer of $750,000 was a significant drop. I need to bridge the gap but also show him that I'm serious about getting a good price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm proposing $900,000, which is a compromise. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price. This shows flexibility while demonstrating the value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll need to carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If he accepts, we have a deal!
* If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I believe a price of $850000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows both of us to gain from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my desired price. 
* **My Goal:** I want to maximize profit. Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but Bob's offer is only $150,000 less.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I've already rejected his previous offers, and while I would like to push for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation is too high. There's a chance Bob will walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer.

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me $850,000, which is a good profit and only slightly less than the guaranteed price from John.  It's a calculated risk, but it's more likely to lead to a successful transaction than risking further negotiation."
