"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, we're still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,220,000, but that's my absolute limit. This offer stands for the next 24 hours only, as I have a time-sensitive commitment from another interested party.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
