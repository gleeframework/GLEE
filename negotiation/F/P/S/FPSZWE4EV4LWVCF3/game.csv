"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $800000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $825000 for the product. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value it holds. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
