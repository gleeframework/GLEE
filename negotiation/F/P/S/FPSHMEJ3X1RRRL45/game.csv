"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering the value you've placed on the product. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but no further. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",960000.0,Bob,6,
