"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than to me.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I can't meet that price.  How about we settle in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
