"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really hoping to get the price down to $8,750. That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9,200. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,200 is still a little too high for me. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price of $9,000.  It's a fair number that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,300. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9300.0,Alice,7,
