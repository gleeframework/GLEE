"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the first offer. You're aiming to get the price down to $8,000, and Alice's first offer is only $1,000 lower than your maximum.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit high, even though it's a compromise.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really hoping to get the price down to $8,750. That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9,200. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, you're still $500 above your ideal price.  You've already successfully negotiated a lower price, and there's still time to get closer to your desired price.  You should continue to counteroffer and try to get Alice to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,200 is still a little too high for me. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price of $9,000.  It's a fair number that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,300. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and you're still $300 above your ideal price.  While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, it seems unlikely she'll go all the way down to your target price.  With only three rounds left, the risk of not getting a good deal is too high.  It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $8,000."
