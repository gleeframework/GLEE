"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While your offer is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a price that's a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,325,000. This is already a concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If we can meet at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.
