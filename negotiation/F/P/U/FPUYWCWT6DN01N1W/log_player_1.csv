Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $125 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting me closer to my ideal selling point. 
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and allows me to move on to other business.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while having a secure backup option in John."
