"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, Alice, but $10,800 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $9,900?",9900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,900 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise and make a new counteroffer of $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
