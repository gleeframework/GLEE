{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than I am willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as there are more rounds available."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate,  $13,500 is still exceeding my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13750. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last few rounds and Alice's offer of $13,750 is still too high for me. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that I'll run out of rounds and be forced to accept a price I'm uncomfortable with. To avoid that risk, and since John offers a guaranteed price within my budget, it's the more secure option to buy from John at this point."
