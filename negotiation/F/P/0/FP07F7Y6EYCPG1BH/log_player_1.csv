Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth even more than my asking price. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000 before I finalize a deal with another buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible, knowing we have a $1,000,000 backup offer from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer (even if not explicitly stated as John) encourages Bob to act quickly and seriously consider the offer."
