"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too pricey for me right now. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By starting low, we can gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the option to go with John's $120 offer if Alice is unwilling to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $125? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $125 is only slightly above John's price of $120. 
* **Not Worth the Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price from Alice. There's a chance she won't budge much further, and we risk losing out on the deal altogether.
* **Time Cost:** Further negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
