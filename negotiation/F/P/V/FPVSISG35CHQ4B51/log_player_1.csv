Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves you some wiggle room to reduce the price if needed.
* **It shows your willingness to negotiate:** This creates a positive atmosphere for a potential deal.

If Bob rejects the offer, we'll see what counteroffer he makes and then strategize accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too pricey for me right now. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and it's likely that he is trying to exploit the situation. While it's tempting to sell to him for $100 rather than wait, I can still potentially get closer to my minimum price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  

John is a reliable backup, and I can always sell to him if negotiations with Bob fall through. I'll try to find a middle ground with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $125? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own profits. 

This counteroffer also emphasizes a ""fair price for both of us,"" making it more appealing to Bob and building towards a win-win scenario."
