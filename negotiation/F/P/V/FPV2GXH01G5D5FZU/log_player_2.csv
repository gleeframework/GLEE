Round 7
Alice's offer:

``` 

You have reached a point where you're very close to your budget but still above it.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to compromise.  Buying from John at this point is the most sensible choice, ensuring you get the product within your budget without further risk."
