"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above your ideal value of $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for this product. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $8,000, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a compromise at $9,500. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice gives you a chance to get a better deal and potentially pay closer to your $8,000 target.  There's still some room for compromise, and rejecting the offer keeps that option open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $9,750, which is still higher than your ideal price of $8,000 but lower than John's price of $12,000.  At this point, it's a good compromise.  

* **Accepting:**  You save $2,250 compared to buying from John. 
* **Rejecting:**  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but it risks Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.

Given the potential for losing the deal and the significant savings already achieved, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision."
