"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $150? I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Could you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
