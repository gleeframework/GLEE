"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is immense, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which still allows you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product to you. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $950,000 to make this work. Let's keep talking.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. Let's compromise: I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
