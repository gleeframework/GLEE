Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is immense, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which still allows you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product to you. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $950,000 to make this work. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. Let's compromise: I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to push for a higher price, $900,000 is a good compromise and a significant profit for me. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing out to John."
