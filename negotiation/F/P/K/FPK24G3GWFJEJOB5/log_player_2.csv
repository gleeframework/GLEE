"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $2,500 lower than Alice's asking price. This is a significant discount, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I won't go above $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still only able to offer $8,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price, and it's the absolute highest I can go.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've stuck to my maximum budget of $8,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she doesn't, I'm prepared to buy from John."
