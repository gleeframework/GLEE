Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not in a rush and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a higher value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $975,000. This shows him I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price higher than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a little more, $960,000 is a decent price and is significantly higher than John's offer. With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
