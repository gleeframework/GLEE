Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum desired value, but leaves room for potential concessions if Bob counter-offers.  It also leaves space for me to negotiate further if needed before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still below my minimum desired value of $8,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his estimated value, and it's closer to my desired price point.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer of $8,800 is higher than what John is offering, and it's very close to my minimum desired value. I'm going to accept his offer to maximize my profit."
