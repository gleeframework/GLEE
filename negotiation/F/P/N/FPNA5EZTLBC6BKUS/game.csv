"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,750. That's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,300. It's getting close to the original price I had in mind, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. What do you think?",9300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $9,300 is still a bit more than I can do. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $8,750. It's a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your offer, Bob. I'm willing to make a bigger concession this time. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $9,100? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there!  $9,100 is getting really close. I'm willing to go to $8,900. This is my final offer, and I truly hope we can come to an agreement.",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,050. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",9050.0,Alice,9,
