Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
