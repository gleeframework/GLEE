# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the value it can bring you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. To move closer to a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant commitment on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective needs."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to accept $1,500,000 for the product.  This is a final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While he could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might not budge further, and Bob would be left with no product and limited time.  John's offer guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price."
