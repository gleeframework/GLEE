"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully nurtured and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant value I know you'll find in this product. I'm open to discussing this further if you'd like. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to purchase from John at a lower cost."
