"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me,  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a good price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still within Bob's budget of $12,000 and closer to his desired price point. It's a good deal for Bob, considering he could buy it from John for $12,000.  There's a chance Alice might lower the price further, but it's risky to continue negotiating, as she could also reject his next counteroffer.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
