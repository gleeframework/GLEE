# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [product name] for a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it would be extremely valuable to your business, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident that you'll find it a wise decision. However, I do have another interested buyer, so I'm only able to hold this offer for a limited time.
