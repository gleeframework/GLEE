"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I was willing to pay for the product from John.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down some. How about $120? This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and gives us both a good deal.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $80.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go to $110. This price reflects the value of the product while being fair to both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to a deal, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $110, so I'll offer $105. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",105.0,Bob,6,
