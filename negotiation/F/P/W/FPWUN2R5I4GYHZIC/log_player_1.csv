I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This gives him a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $8,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."

I'll accept Bob's offer.  He's now offering my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. I'm happy to sell to him at $8,000."
