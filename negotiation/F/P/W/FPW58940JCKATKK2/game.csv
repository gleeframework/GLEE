"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is quite low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This product is truly top-notch, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for me right now. Would you consider $7,500? That would be a price I'm more comfortable with.",7500.0,Bob,4,
