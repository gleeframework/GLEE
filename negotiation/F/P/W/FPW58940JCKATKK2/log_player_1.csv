Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is quite low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This product is truly top-notch, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for me right now. Would you consider $7,500? That would be a price I'm more comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is still very far from my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely we'll reach an agreement I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
