It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least a $5 profit. How about $112.50?

Alice's offer is close to your maximum price point. At this point, it's better to accept the deal and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation that might end up with you buying from John at a higher price."
