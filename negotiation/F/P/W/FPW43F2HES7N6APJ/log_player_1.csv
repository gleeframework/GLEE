Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, we know he's price-sensitive. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $10,000, ensuring we don't lose out."
