Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we have quite a gap between our valuations. I'm trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to drop my price significantly to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential return on investment this product offers. Let me know your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**  Alice has dropped her price, but it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price you're willing to pay, especially since she stated $1,200,000 is her final offer.  Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
