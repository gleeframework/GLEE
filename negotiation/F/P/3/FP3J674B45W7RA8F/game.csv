"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your operations.  I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential, but is also fair for both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a win-win scenario, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset while securing a strong return for me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
