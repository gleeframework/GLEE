Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,300,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can find common ground on this figure."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
