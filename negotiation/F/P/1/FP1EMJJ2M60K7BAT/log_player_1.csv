Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could sell it for elsewhere.  Consider this a one-time opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $1,400,000. This is a price that is:
    *  **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so $1,400,000 represents a substantial profit for him.
    *  **Lower than my fallback value:**  My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000 (John's offer), so I'm willing to compromise slightly.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the potential profit for Bob while subtly reminding him of the limited opportunity.

**Why this approach?**

* **Negotiation strategy:**  By starting slightly lower than my minimum, I create room for negotiation.  If Bob counters, I can adjust my price based on his response.
* **Motivating Bob:**  Highlighting the profit opportunity for Bob increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Knowing I have John's offer as a backup gives me confidence in negotiating with Bob."
