"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $8,750. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,100. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you place on it.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your continued flexibility, $9,100 is still too high for me.  We're getting closer, but I'm not comfortable going above $8,800 at this point. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both place on the product. It's a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price point. What do you think?",8800.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $8,900, which is just a little more than my last offer. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's my final offer. Let's close this deal.",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,900 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $9,050. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9050.0,Alice,9,
