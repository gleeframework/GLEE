Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while also demonstrating your willingness to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to counter with $11,125. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,125 is very close to my minimum price of $12,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $12,000, it's likely that we'll continue to haggle back and forth, and I may not reach my target.  It's better to accept this offer and move on."
