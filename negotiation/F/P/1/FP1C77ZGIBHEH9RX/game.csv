"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, considering its potential value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards closing this deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm prepared to offer $1250000. This represents a fair compromise and gives us both an opportunity to make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation and appreciate your continued interest. While $1250000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1600000. This represents a fair price considering the value and potential of the product. I believe this offer is a good middle ground and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1600000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1400000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
