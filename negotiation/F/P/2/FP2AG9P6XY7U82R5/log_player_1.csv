Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially worth far more than my asking price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle above John's offer ($800,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a decision faster.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guaranteed ""best"" offer as it depends on Bob's risk tolerance and negotiation skills.  We could start even higher and be willing to negotiate down if needed."
