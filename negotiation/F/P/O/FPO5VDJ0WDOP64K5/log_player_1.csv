"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't pay more than $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is the lowest I'm willing to go at this time.  I understand your position, so let's meet in the middle - would you consider $125?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe that $100 would be a fair price for the product. Could we possibly agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Reason: Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $100 offer.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate when I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John."
