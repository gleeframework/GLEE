Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,000,000, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I have John as a backup, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or find a better alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this work for me.  Let's meet halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a decent price while staying within my budget. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I want. I'm going to stick to my goal of $1,500,000 and see if I can push Bob a little further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value the product brings to you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,150,000 is closer, I still need to stay within a tighter budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,125,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum goal, it's still not quite there. I'm confident that I can negotiate a slightly better price in the next round, or I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, I need to stay above $1,140,000 to make this work for me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a certain price to make this work.  I'm willing to go up to $1,130,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to me, and it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While I'm close to getting my desired price from Bob, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
