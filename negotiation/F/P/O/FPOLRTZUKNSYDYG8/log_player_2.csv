"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible.  Rejecting allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this work for me.  Let's meet halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,200,000 is still outside Bob's desired range. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his target of $800,000. Rejecting allows him to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a decent price while staying within my budget. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value the product brings to you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming closer to Bob's target price, $1,150,000 is still above Bob's preferred range. He can continue negotiating, hoping to push Alice further down.  There's still room for a counteroffer before needing to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,150,000 is closer, I still need to stay within a tighter budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,125,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, I need to stay above $1,140,000 to make this work for me.  This is a small increase from your last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, $1,140,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's ideal price. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob has a good chance to get closer to his goal by continuing to negotiate.  He can make another counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a certain price to make this work.  I'm willing to go up to $1,130,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to me, and it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 1130000}
