Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's something you'd find valuable.  I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes it more likely you'll get a price closer to your ideal.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, subtly highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational, suggesting Alice is open to discussing the price further if Bob hesitates.

Even if Bob rejects the $100 offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's no risk of losing money."
