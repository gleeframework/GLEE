Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high asking price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $500,000 profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** You can then counter-offer, still aiming higher than $1,000,000. If negotiations fail, you have John as a safety net."
