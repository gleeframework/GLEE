{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still represents a reasonable starting point for negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than your desired price range. While it's a step in the right direction, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. It's worth continuing to push for a better deal, as the time limit for negotiation still allows for further rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's try $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value we both see in this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** This counteroffer shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** The price of $1,100,000 is a good middle ground between Alice's previous offer and your previous offer. 
* **Focus on Shared Value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product, implying a shared understanding of its worth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Limit:** While $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than your ideal price, it's getting closer to your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Time:** You're nearing the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Rejecting it could lead to a stalemate, forcing you to buy from John.

**Conclusion:**

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer at $1,125,000 is the most sensible choice at this point. It secures the product within your budget and avoids the risk of a higher price from John."
