"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's try $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value we both see in this product.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
