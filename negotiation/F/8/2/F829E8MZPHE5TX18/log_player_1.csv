Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $16,500 for the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still only able to go up to $15,500. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here.

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $15,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my original asking price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have John as a backup buyer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15,500. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more for it, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and we seem to be stuck. I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to haggle."
