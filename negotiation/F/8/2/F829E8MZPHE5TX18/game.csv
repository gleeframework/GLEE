"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $16,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's work together to make this happen.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still only able to go up to $15,500. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product.  Let's meet halfway at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my investment in it.  I'm confident you'll find it a great deal, and I'm open to discussing it further.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15,500. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,6,
