"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging.  This is important to maintain a good relationship with Bob even if he rejects the initial offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefit to Bob (""you'll find it very useful""). This might make him more likely to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* I want to see if Bob is willing to pay something closer to my value.
* If he rejects, I'll use the next rounds to adjust my price based on his counteroffers and keep an eye on the number of rounds left to decide whether to switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $75 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Time Remaining:** I have several rounds left, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price higher than $75 but lower than my initial offer of $100, hoping to find a middle ground. I'll use the remaining rounds to see if we can reach an agreement or if I need to switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing money.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept the offer.
* If he rejects, I'll continue to adjust my offer in the subsequent rounds based on his responses, keeping in mind the number of rounds remaining and the potential to switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been considering your offers, and I would like to propose $85 as my maximum budget for this product. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's getting closer, it's not enough for me to accept.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Bob to increase his offer.
* **Time Remaining:**  I have several rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price higher than $85 but lower than my previous offer of $90.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground. I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds remaining and the potential to switch to John if we can't agree."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $85 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about $88?  That's a small increase, and it might help us close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $3, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $88 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm still using a positive and encouraging tone, trying to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping this small increase will convince Bob to accept the offer. 
* If he rejects, I'll need to consider the number of rounds remaining and whether it's worth continuing with Bob or switching to John."

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $86 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's close, I'm not willing to lose that much money. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Bob to increase his offer just a little more.
* **Time Remaining:**  I have several rounds left, so I can afford to keep negotiating.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $86, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds remaining and the potential to switch to John if necessary."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a small decrease from my previous offer, showing I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Close to Minimum:** $87 is just $3 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the benefits for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping this small decrease will convince Bob to accept.
* If he rejects, I'll need to carefully consider the remaining rounds and whether to continue with Bob or switch to John.  If I reject his next counteroffer, I might end up with no deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the last few rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of No Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk ending up with no deal at all.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John is offering me $120, which is a guaranteed profit for me.

**Strategy:**
