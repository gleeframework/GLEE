"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $7,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing we're not quite aligned on price. I'm really hoping to work something out with you as I think you'll find this product extremely valuable.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,500?  This is a fair price that gives us both some wiggle room. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,5,
