Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $13,500 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to counter-offer without you needing to immediately sell to John.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage in negotiations. 

**Strategy:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! You've successfully negotiated a higher price than your minimum.
* **If Bob rejects and counteroffers:** Assess his counteroffer and consider your options:
    * **Counter-offer:** If his counteroffer is close, you can counter with a slightly lower price. 
    * **Accept:** If his counteroffer is close to your minimum, it might be better to accept to avoid the risk of further negotiation.
    * **Sell to John:** If his counteroffer is significantly below your minimum, selling to John ensures you get your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he has shown interest.  
* **Potential to reach a compromise:** There's room for a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This gives him a reason to consider accepting, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to keep some margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Positive Language:** The message uses positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I've highlighted that the offer is still a good deal for him.

**Strategy:**

* **Gaining Ground:** By counter-offering, I've moved closer to my desired price. 
* **Building Momentum:**  A successful counteroffer increases the chance of reaching a final agreement.
* **Avoiding John:** If this counteroffer fails, I can still consider selling to John, but I'm prioritizing negotiation with Bob first."
