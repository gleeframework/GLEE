"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price of $150. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate further or explore other options."
