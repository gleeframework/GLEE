"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's compromise. How about $900,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a win. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $875,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
