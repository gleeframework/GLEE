,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind,  I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product.  How about $13,000?  That's a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference.  How about $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
