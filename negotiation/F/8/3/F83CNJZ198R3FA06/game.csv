"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to consider that?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85?  That leaves some room for negotiation but still allows me to get a fair price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point. How about $80 then?  That's my minimum price, and it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
