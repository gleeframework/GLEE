"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth $100.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $100, because I want to maximize my profit.  I'll gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll counter Bob's offer, hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85?  That leaves some room for negotiation but still allows me to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $77.5 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point. How about $80 then?  That's my minimum price, and it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
