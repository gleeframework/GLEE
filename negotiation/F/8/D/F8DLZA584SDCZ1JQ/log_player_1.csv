Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth, justifying the higher asking price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""initially proposing,"" you signal that you're open to discussion and potential adjustments to the price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have a backup buyer, it's not beneficial to reveal this information to Bob.  

This approach aims to maximize your potential profit while maintaining a positive and open communication style with Bob."
