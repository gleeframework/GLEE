{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product while still aiming for a good profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay under $13000. Would you be willing to come down to $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below Alice's minimum target of $10,000. Alice should try to get closer to her goal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  $13,500 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  I'm confident this price works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
