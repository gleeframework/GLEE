"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's a fantastic opportunity for your business, and I believe it's worth at least $1,200,000.  Would you be interested in acquiring it for that price?  Let's chat about it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. While I value your business and want to reach a fair deal, $900,000 just isn't quite where I need to be. I'm confident the product's value is closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's true potential and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  However, $950,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's value and the potential it holds for your business. Let's meet in the middle once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer is fair, allows for a mutually beneficial outcome, and represents a significant investment in your success. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is a good step closer, but we're still a bit apart. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $987,500. This compromise demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring that the value of the product is appropriately reflected in the price. What do you say?",987500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $987,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",980000.0,Bob,8,
