Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's a fantastic opportunity for your business, and I believe it's worth at least $1,200,000.  Would you be interested in acquiring it for that price?  Let's chat about it."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, highlighting that it's a ""fantastic opportunity"" for his business. This can encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for negotiation by saying, ""Let's chat about it."" This avoids making it seem like a hard-line offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $900,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I have 10 rounds and the value of the product to Bob is significantly higher than his offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can initiate a counteroffer and potentially move closer to my desired price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still motivated to get closer to my target of $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. While I value your business and want to reach a fair deal, $900,000 just isn't quite where I need to be. I'm confident the product's value is closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  However, $950,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's value and the potential it holds for your business. Let's meet in the middle once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $987,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is of the Essence:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds (only 2 left), and I'm running out of time to secure a better price. 
* **Close to Target:** $980,000 is very close to my previous offer of $987,500, and it's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.

**Conclusion:** Given the time constraint and the relatively small gap between our offers, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision. It allows me to secure a good profit without risking losing the deal altogether."
