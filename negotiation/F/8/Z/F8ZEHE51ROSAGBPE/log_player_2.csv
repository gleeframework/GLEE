# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a good deal for Bob, but he can likely get a better price. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to go lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target of $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to make one final offer: $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's a good deal for him, as he can get the product for $850,000, which is significantly less than what John is offering.  While he could potentially continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice would budge further.  He has already come close to his desired price, and it's risky to risk losing the deal altogether."
