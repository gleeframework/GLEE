"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $700,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $800,000.  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to make one final offer: $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
