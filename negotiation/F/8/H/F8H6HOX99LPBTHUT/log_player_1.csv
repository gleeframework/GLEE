"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your belief in the product's value. However, I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both of our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
Even though I could try to negotiate for a higher price, Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. It's best to accept now and avoid the risk of losing both potential buyers.
