Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:**  A friendly and encouraging tone helps build rapport and increases the chances of Bob accepting your offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and potentially closing the deal quickly. If Bob rejects, you'll have the information to adjust your counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider meeting me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **The message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget but reinforces the value of the product. It's positive and encourages further negotiation.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while still protecting my interests.  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to consider my options more carefully, potentially moving towards selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm not willing to go above $8,000. I'd like to propose a final offer of $8,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $8,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to compromise further.  I've reached a point where selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a better outcome and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
