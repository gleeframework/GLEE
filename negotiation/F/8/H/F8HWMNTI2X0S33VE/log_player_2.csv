"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a better price than John's $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his own valuation of $100.  Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still gives her some room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I can do a bit better than that. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $115, but Bob can still get a better deal.  There's still some room to negotiate, and Bob can try to get closer to his target price of $100 by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $115 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $110. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get closer to his target price of $100. Offering $110 is a good compromise, showing he's willing to negotiate while still trying to save as much money as possible. The message emphasizes closing the deal, adding pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about buying the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $112? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112, which is only $2 away from Bob's counteroffer of $110.  This is a good deal for Bob, as he is saving $38 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation may only result in a small price drop, and the risk of Alice walking away is increasing.  It's a good time to accept the offer."
