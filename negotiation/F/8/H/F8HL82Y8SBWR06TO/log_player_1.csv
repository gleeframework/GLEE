Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""backup"" price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning there's room for negotiation. 
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit without alienating Bob and losing him as a buyer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  This price is significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves Bob with a substantial profit margin ($150,000). 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition""  subtly reminds Bob why he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're aiming for a ""fair deal,"" implying there might be some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob counters.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Have a range in mind where you're willing to go lower.
* **Relationship Matters:** Even though you have a backup buyer, a successful deal with Bob could lead to future opportunities.
