"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than $8,000 from John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is tempting and getting closer to my desired price, I still feel I can get closer to $12,000.  There are still 6 rounds left.  I'll reject this offer and try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close but $10,250 is still a little low for me.  Let's compromise at $10,750. This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the third time Bob has offered $10,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $12,000, there are only 4 rounds remaining and I'm getting closer to the ""Sell to John"" option.  I'm confident that $10,500 is a fair price given the value to Bob and my minimum of $8,000.  It's a good deal for both of us."
