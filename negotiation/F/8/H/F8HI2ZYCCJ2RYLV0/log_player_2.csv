You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice to potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you think $1,100,000 is a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still higher than what John is offering, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price with Alice.  It's best to secure the product for the lowest price possible."
