Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer him a price of $900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons of accepting his offer. If I accept, I'll make a profit of $250,000, which is a decent amount. However, I might be leaving money on the table.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price. I'll offer him a price of $850,000, which is higher than his original offer but still lower than my initial offer.
