Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'll be paying attention to Bob's reaction to gauge his interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get a higher price if I continue negotiating.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept it and secure the sale. While I would prefer to get closer to $13,500, I believe further negotiation might be time-consuming and there's a risk he might reject my next offer. It's better to close this deal and guarantee the sale."
