Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $875,000. Would you be willing to consider this?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However,  $875,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Let's meet closer to the middle - how about $910,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $880,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and the price is getting closer to our ideal range. We're still above our minimum, so it's worth pushing a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This product is incredibly valuable, and I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us.  How about we settle on $895,000? This feels like a good compromise."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $885,000. This is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now stated this is his final offer. While we could push for a bit more, it's getting risky. Accepting this offer guarantees us a good profit ($85,000 above our minimum) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely."
