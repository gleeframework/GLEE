Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a great deal and you'll be very happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum ($150) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Creating Urgency:** By offering it to Bob first, I'm subtly implying there's another buyer (John) waiting in the wings. This might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:** While brief, mentioning that it's a ""great deal"" aims to plant a seed of value in Bob's mind.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Excellent! I make a profit of $40, which is better than selling to John directly.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  I can consider a small price reduction, but I won't go below $150 as I have John as a guaranteed backup.
* **Bob Rejects:** No problem, I sell to John for my minimum acceptable price and still achieve my goal."
