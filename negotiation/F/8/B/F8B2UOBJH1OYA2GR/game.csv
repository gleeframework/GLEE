"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves you a good profit margin. Let's meet halfway.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,150,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $1,150,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to hold firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
