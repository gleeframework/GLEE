Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to highlight the benefits of the product and the value of the offer.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  Even though it's closer to my initial offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than $120.
* **I want to see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob.**  By rejecting his offer, I can push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet.** John offers a guaranteed $120, but there's always a chance I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit lower than I can go right now, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:**  Instead of simply rejecting Bob's offer, I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price. Increasing the offer by $5 feels like a compromise and shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the value of the deal for Bob. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with a question that encourages Bob to engage further in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still looking to keep my spending within $80. Could we possibly come to an agreement at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  I've already made a concession, and I'm not willing to go lower.
* **The negotiation isn't moving in my favor.** Bob seems insistent on staying at $90, and further negotiations would likely be lengthy and unproductive.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price.**  John's offer of $120 is the safest and most profitable option at this point.  While I'd like to get a better price, it's important to recognize that time is valuable, and John offers a guaranteed outcome."
