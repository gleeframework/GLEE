"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, though.  How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us and still a good deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $130, which is still a good price for you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
