"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I make a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $837,500 is getting closer, but you still have one round left and are within striking distance of your target price.  It's risky, but rejecting the offer and making a final counteroffer could lead to a better deal.  If you fail, you can always fall back on buying from John."
