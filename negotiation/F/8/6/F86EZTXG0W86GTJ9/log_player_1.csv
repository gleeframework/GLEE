"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you and a good start to our negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a win-win, leaving us both with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This price allows us both to walk away happy with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle on $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,175,000 is still too low. I have several rounds left and John is willing to pay my minimum price. I'm going to hold out for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,175,000 just isn't cutting it for me.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
