Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a win-win, leaving us both with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This price allows us both to walk away happy with a fair deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,175,000 just isn't cutting it for me.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which is the same price John offers. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice since you can get the same price from John without further haggling."
