"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for $15000. It's a great opportunity to own something that's worth a lot to you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we aim for a price of $13500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $12000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
