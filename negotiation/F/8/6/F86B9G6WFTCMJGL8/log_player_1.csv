"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in.  I'm asking $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is slightly above what I know the product is worth to me.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute maximum price, giving Bob an incentive to make a counteroffer and potentially get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for Better Outcome:**  I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John is a Backup:**  While John is a guaranteed sale at $100, I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate the counteroffer. However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $110 to $105, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Upside for Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to get me a better price, especially with only 6 rounds remaining.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While John is also offering $100, accepting Bob's offer guarantees the sale without any further risk of losing a deal."
