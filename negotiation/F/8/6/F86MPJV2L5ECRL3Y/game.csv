"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $125. Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not sure $112.50 is enough for me to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $130. Let's meet in the middle at $130.5. What do you think?",130.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm trying to be fair here.  I understand you need to make a profit, but $130.5 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That gives us both a good deal.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $135. I'm willing to give you a small concession, so I'll meet you at $127.50. That's the lowest I can go.",127.5,Alice,7,
