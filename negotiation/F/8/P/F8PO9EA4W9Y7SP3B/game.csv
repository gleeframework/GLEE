"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value and uniqueness of the product you're offering. However, I'm currently working within a budget that doesn't quite stretch to $750000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $600000? I believe this might be more in line with what we can both agree upon.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $700000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $650000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $680000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my original asking price.",680000.0,Alice,5,
