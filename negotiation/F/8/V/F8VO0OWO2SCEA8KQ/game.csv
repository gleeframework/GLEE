"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference again and settle at $760,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $760,000 yet. I'm willing to go up to $810,000, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
