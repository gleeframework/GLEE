"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $1,320,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1320000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,320,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,250,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is still a bit above your target. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. To be honest, $1,280,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,265,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1265000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,265,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight concession, though. I can sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a little further. I'm willing to offer $1,270,000.  This is a firm offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the time we've spent negotiating.",1270000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,270,000 is a serious offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I can offer you a slight concession, though. I can sell the product to you for $1,285,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price.",1285000.0,Alice,9,
