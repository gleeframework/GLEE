"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $150, but it's also higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's perceived value of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, and I believe we can both be happy with this price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer you the product for $100.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $92? I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffers again is high, and I don't want to waste any more time.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future."
