"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, and I believe we can both be happy with this price.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer you the product for $100.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $92? I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.",92.0,Bob,6,
