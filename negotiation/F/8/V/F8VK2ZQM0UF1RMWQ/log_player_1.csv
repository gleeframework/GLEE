Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations with Bob at a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth $19,000 to Bob, it hints at its value and encourages Bob to think about its potential benefits. 
* **Urgency:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might push Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a buffer between your asking price and your minimum acceptable price, allowing you to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
