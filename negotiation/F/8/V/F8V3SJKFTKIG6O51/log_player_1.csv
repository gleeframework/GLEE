Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $1,750,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a good deal for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** My goal is to push Bob towards my desired price point while keeping the negotiation open. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **I need to keep negotiating.**  I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Selling to John is an option.**  It's a guaranteed $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to try and make this deal work. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $1,600,000, which is a compromise but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to negotiate, but I'm also reiterating the value of the product.
* **Strategy:** By gradually decreasing my price, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to compromise but also ensuring that I don't undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. Would you consider $1,500,000 as a fair offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.**  This is the point where selling to John becomes a direct comparison. 
* **There's little room for further negotiation.**  I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Accepting secures the deal.**  I've achieved my minimum goal and avoided the risk of further negotiation."
