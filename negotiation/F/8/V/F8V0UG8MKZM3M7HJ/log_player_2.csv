"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $150 for it, as I believe it's worth every penny. Would you like to take a look and consider the offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You know the product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is also offering it for $150. There's no benefit to accepting her offer since you can get the same product from John for the same price."
