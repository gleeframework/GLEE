"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000. That's a significant concession from my last offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,000 is a good step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want to get the best price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,800, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can close this deal. ",9800.0,Alice,7,
