Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to start by offering a price higher than that to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance at a price favorable to me. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $170 offer isn't excessively high, which might discourage Bob completely. It leaves space for him to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than my minimum.
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** While I know Bob values the product at $80,  it's unlikely he'll reveal that information. My offer needs to seem reasonable while still aiming for the highest possible profit.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. If Bob rejects it, I can always counter with a lower price, strategically moving closer to my minimum of $150."
