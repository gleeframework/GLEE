"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a better deal than buying from John, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'd like to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  Bob is offering a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price. This signals his serious intent to buy but also shows his awareness of the product's true value.
* **Reasoning:** Bob justifies his counteroffer with a focus on fairness and mutual benefit. This approach attempts to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $850,000 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Still Above Value:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $900,000 is still above the product's value to her ($800,000).  
* **Potential for Lower Price:**  Bob can likely still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 7 rounds remaining, Bob needs to be strategic and not rush into accepting an offer that might be further reduced."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $890,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $915,000.

* **Testing Alice's Limits:** Alice has indicated this is her ""final offer"" within this range. Rejecting it will likely force her to lower the price further.
