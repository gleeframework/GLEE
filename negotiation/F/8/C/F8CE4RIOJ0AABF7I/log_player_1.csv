Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum acceptable price:** I know I can get at least $8,000 from John, so I want to try and get more from Bob.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay more, and I can potentially negotiate a higher price.

However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to accept John's offer of $8,000. This strategy balances the risk of losing a sale with the potential for maximizing my profit."
