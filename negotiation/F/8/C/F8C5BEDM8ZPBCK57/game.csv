"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,500. This still allows me to make a decent profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Let's find a price that works for both of us!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
