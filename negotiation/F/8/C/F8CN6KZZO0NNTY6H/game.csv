,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $120 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $170? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $170 is still a bit steep for me though. How about we meet in the middle at $145? ",145.0,Bob,4,
