"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $13,000 is pushing my limit. I can offer you $12,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and your valuation. Let's see if we can agree on this.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,500 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $13,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation.",13250.0,Alice,5,
