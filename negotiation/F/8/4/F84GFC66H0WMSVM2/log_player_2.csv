"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, but still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down to $125, which is close enough to my limit. It's better to accept and save a little than risk losing the deal altogether."
