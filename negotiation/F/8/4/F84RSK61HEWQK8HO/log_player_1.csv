Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer right now. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so a $12,000 price is within his potential range, but still allows for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum value:** Your minimum value is $15,000, so you are still leaving room for negotiation while also making a profit.
* **It shows flexibility:** By offering a price that's not your absolute minimum, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
 
Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response!"
