"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our flagship product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the impact it can have on your operations, I am offering it to you for $2000000. This price reflects not only the product's worth but also the exclusive access and support we provide to our valued customers. I look forward to discussing this opportunity further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in your product, but the price of $2,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is fair considering my needs. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
