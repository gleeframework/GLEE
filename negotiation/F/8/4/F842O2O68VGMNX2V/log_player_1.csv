Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in your product, but the price of $2000000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is the maximum I can afford. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is fair considering my needs. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
