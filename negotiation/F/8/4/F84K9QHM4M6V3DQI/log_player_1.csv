Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see how Bob values the product and if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it for that price just yet.  I'm going to try and get a bit more from Bob before I settle for the minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still a good price for me, as it's more than my minimum, but it's also a significant discount from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. I hope this will be a good compromise for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his initial offer, and I've already made a significant concession.  Rather than continue a drawn-out negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's my minimum, and while I'd have preferred more, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
