Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that could significantly benefit your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **High Anchor:** This initial price sets a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to $1,100,000 than your fallback price of $800,000.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value while not appearing overly aggressive, which could scare Bob away.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance, you might choose a different approach."
