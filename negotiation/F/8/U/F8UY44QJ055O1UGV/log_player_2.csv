"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $850,000 is the lowest I can go.  This price reflects the product's true value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay above $800,000.  Let's compromise at $812,500.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Alice is trying to compromise, she's still trying to get a price above your absolute limit. John offers the product at your target price, so it's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice."
