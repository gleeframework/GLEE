Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  By starting high, I give Bob a sense of urgency and motivate him to counter-offer. This allows for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Sets a high bar:** This establishes my expectation that the product is valuable and worth a significant price.
* **Provides leverage:** If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can use the potential sale to John ($1,500,000) to emphasize that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Important Note:** This strategy relies on the assumption that Bob is motivated to buy the product and might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation if he sees the potential value. If Bob is unwilling to negotiate at all, I will need to consider selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer for the following reasons:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product, and there's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Avoiding a suboptimal outcome:** Selling for $1,200,000 would leave me significantly below my desired profit.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the leverage of selling to John for $1,500,000. This gives me a strong position during the counteroffer phase.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than $1,200,000 but still lower than my initial offer of $1,800,000. This will keep the negotiation moving and test whether Bob is willing to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is $1,600,000.  Here's why:

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not immediately dropping to $1,500,000, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and have some room to negotiate.
* **Signal of seriousness:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also expect a fair price.

This strategy aims to:

* Encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer if he's truly interested.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I can  either make another counteroffer or choose to sell to John, knowing that I've at least tried to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below John's offer. At this point, the negotiation seems to be going nowhere.

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Guarantee a good price:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired profit, avoiding a potential loss.
* **Time is money:** Continued negotiation with Bob might lead to a better price but could also result in a delay and further decrease in value.
* **Avoiding further frustration:** Bob's repeated rejections suggest he might not be serious about a deal.  

**Conclusion:** While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John provides a safe and efficient way to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  It's time to move on and secure a deal that meets my financial goals."
