"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $1,000,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you encourage her to potentially offer a better deal."
