"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and the reduction from your initial offer. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm open to negotiation, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
