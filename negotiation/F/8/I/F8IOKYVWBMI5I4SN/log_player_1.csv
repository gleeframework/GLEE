Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's highly valuable and would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (John), I have room to negotiate. Starting at $20,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. This can make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know what you think!"" suggests flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
