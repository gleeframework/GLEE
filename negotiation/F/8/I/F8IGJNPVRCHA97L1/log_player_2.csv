"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer and sell it to you for $750,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you have other options, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that beats John's $800,000 offer at this point.  Further haggling is likely to yield minimal returns and could risk losing the product altogether."
