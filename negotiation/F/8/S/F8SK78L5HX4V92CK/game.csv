"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $10,500?  That still leaves a good amount of profit for me while being a fair price for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
