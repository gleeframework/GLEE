Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still lower than the value the product holds for Bob. This gives Bob an incentive to accept, but also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to offer a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $125. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already rejected his offer twice, and it seems like he's not willing to go higher.  Since John is also willing to buy for $120, I'll just sell to John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob if he won't budge."
