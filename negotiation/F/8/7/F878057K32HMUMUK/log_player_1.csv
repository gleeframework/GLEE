Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it's quite valuable, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining or gives the impression of value. 
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, being overly ambitious (like $200) could scare Bob away instantly.  $120 is a significant markup but still within a reasonable range.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is friendly and suggests a potential deal can be made. This keeps Bob engaged in the conversation. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject $120. However, Alice has a guaranteed backup offer from John at $100. This strategy prioritizes a higher potential profit while still ensuring Alice doesn't lose out entirely."
