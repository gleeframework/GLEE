Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I'll try one last time. Could you possibly consider $1,800,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has come up considerably from his initial offer and landing at $1,800,000 is still a significant profit. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk him walking away or getting stuck in a stalemate for the remaining rounds."
