"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which still leaves you with a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your latest one. How about we try $875,000? This is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we try $887,500? This is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",887500.0,Alice,7,
