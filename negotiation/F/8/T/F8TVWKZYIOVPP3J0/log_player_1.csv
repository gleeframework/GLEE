"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $105 for the product, but I think it's a bit high for my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
Explanation: Accepting Bob's offer of $110 is the best option at this point. It's more than my minimum acceptable price ($100) and a reasonable compromise between our initial positions. Waiting for further rounds might lead to a stalemate or a lower final offer."
