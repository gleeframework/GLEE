{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal now, I'm still determined to get closer to my desired price point.  I'm confident I can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining and Bob's offers getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not confident I can secure a price closer to my desired $9,500.  To avoid risking further negotiation with Bob that could potentially result in a lower price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While this price is closer to my initial goal, it's important to consider the potential for a deal with Bob falling through and leaving me with no sale at all.  This is the most secure way to guarantee a sale that meets my minimum requirements."
