"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which holds immense value to both of us. I understand its significance to you, as it is worth $1,500,000 to you personally. My goal is to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement that respects the product's true worth while also ensuring a fair return for me.

I propose to offer you the chance to purchase this product at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount from its market value, allowing you to secure a high-quality asset at a competitive price. I believe this offer presents a unique opportunity for you to capitalize on the product's value and potentially realize substantial returns over time.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product or the offer. I am here to assist you throughout the process and provide any additional information you might need to make an informed decision.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly above the product's worth to her ($800,000). While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal to Alice that I'm looking for a better deal, potentially bringing her closer to her actual valuation."
