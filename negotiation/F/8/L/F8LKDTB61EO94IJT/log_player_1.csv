Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 allows for potential negotiation down to a price that's still very profitable for you.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you subtly introduce a time constraint that might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal that's significantly better than your fallback option (John at $10,000)."
