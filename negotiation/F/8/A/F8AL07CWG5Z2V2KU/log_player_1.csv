Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 gives some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly.

**Why not higher?**

Going too close to $1,000,000 (like $990,000) risks Bob rejecting the offer outright. Even if it's a great deal for him, people are often hesitant to accept offers that seem ""too good to be true"" or leave them with almost no profit margin."
