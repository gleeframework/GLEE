"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy in negotiation to start with an ambitious but justifiable offer. This leaves room for potential concessions while anchoring the discussion around a higher value. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's initial reaction and understand his perception of the product's value. His response will guide my strategy in subsequent rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 at any time. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my investment. I'm proposing a price of $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I want to reach a deal, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to steer the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and providing your perspective. I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  I'm holding firm above my minimum price of $800,000 to ensure profitability.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Concession:** While significant, the decrease from $1,000,000 to $900,000 shows a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Time Consideration:** We're still in the early rounds, so I have room to negotiate without feeling pressured to accept a less favorable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely that Bob will go much higher. Accepting this offer ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away from the deal entirely."
