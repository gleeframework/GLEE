"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"

# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer the product to you for $10,200. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to work with me. I still think $10,000 is a more reasonable price. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at that price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can offer the product to you for $10,250. It's a small step closer to your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer is still above his budget, and he has already made several counteroffers without success. It's likely that Alice won't go lower than $10,000. Buying from John is the most efficient option at this point."
