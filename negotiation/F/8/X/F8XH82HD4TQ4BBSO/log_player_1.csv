Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it leaves some room for negotiation and still represents a good value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a decent price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe $1,400,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  It's also significantly higher than what I would receive from John. It's time to close the deal."
