"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. While the product sounds great, $200 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $170. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference at $140? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $140, Bob. I can do $160, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
