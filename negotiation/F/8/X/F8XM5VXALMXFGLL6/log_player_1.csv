Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in your product, but  $11500 is a bit higher than I can go right now. Would you be willing to consider $10500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
