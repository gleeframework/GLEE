"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in your product, but  $11500 is a bit higher than I can go right now. Would you be willing to consider $10500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10500 is a good starting point, but I'm still looking for a little more to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $11000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate that.  $11000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm getting closer. How about $10750?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow me to move forward with the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10875? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to move forward with this purchase.  What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
