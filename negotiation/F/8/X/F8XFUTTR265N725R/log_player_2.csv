Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $8,500 and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000."
