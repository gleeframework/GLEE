"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Could you possibly do $7,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
