"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to offer $8,000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still above his budget. While he could accept this and still be below Alice's minimum, he should try to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, as that's the absolute most I can realistically spend.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9500, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a good value for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is not willing to come down to a price that Bob can afford.  He's already gone over his initial budget and is unlikely to get a better deal from Alice.  It's time to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
