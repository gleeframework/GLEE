"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you and I'm happy to part with it at that price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try negotiating a lower price first before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's a negotiation tactic to start with a significantly lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a much better deal.
* **Target Price in Mind:** Remember, your goal is to buy the product for as close to $8,000 (its worth to Alice) as possible, while staying under your $12,000 limit. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By offering $6,000,  you signal that you're serious but also expect Alice to move on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is way too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $8,500 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's a good chance you can negotiate further. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  You have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting an offer that isn't ideal. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  Remember, you always have the option to buy from John for $12,000 if negotiations with Alice don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? It's a win-win for both of us. "",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to a potential agreement. Offering $7,500 is a significant jump from your previous offer but still leaves you room to negotiate.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While you have rounds left, it's good to start creating a sense of urgency to push the negotiation along. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  Keep the communication positive and collaborative, emphasizing that you're looking for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids the risk of us not reaching an agreement.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **At Alice's Value:** Alice has come down to her perceived value of the product ($8,000). It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Saving Money:** You're getting the product for significantly less than John's offer ($12,000) and saving $4,000. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** Trying to negotiate further is risky. Alice might not budge, and you could miss out on this price."
