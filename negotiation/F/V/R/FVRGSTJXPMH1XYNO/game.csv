"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you and I'm happy to part with it at that price. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is way too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm happy to meet you halfway.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? It's a win-win for both of us. ",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids the risk of us not reaching an agreement.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
