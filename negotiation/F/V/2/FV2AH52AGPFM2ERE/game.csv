"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the significant savings it offers compared to buying from John.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
