# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'm also not in a rush, so I can afford to play a few rounds to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
