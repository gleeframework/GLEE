"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  There's no need to accept Alice's offer at $1,400,000. It's better to counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is too far below my value for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise, and gives you a significant savings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  You're still closer to your goal price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  The longer you wait, the more likely Alice is to come down in price to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still looking for a slightly lower price. How about $1,300,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer. $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This would allow us to both walk away satisfied with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  You're getting closer to your target price.  It's likely that you won't be able to get it lower than $1,325,000. Accepting this offer gives you a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice walking away."
