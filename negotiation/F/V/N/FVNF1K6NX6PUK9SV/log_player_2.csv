"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $13,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  While $13,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above his ideal price point. He should try to get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth a considerable amount more to me than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,500 is a good price for him, as it is well below his maximum price of $15,000 and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  While he might be able to get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, there is a risk that Alice will walk away, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
