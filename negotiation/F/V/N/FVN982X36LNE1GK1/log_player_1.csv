"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a strong opening offer that allows room for negotiation.  It's important to remember I'm valuing the product at $800,000, so anything above that is a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept his first counteroffer. He's starting low, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better price.  I'll see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm price in mind.  I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm going to reject this offer. It's still too low, and I have several more rounds to work with.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that he needs to offer closer to my valuation if he wants to get the product.  I'm going to try and counter again, but I'm also starting to consider if selling to John for $800,000 is a more secure option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  It's lower than my previous offer, but still above John's offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob is clearly not willing to negotiate any higher, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed profit, and I'm not comfortable with the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me."
