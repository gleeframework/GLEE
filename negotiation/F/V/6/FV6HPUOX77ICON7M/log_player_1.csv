Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting significantly higher at $2,250,000  leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing Alice's minimum price. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further"" signals to Bob that Alice is willing to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. While this strategy maximizes potential profit in this specific scenario,  real-world negotiations often involve multiple rounds and require a more nuanced approach."
