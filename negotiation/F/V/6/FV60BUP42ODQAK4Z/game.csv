"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $1,200,000. Given its value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a slightly tighter budget. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $950,000. I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go. I'm hoping we can make a deal work at that price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is the highest you can go, and I appreciate your honesty. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is still a compromise but closer to the product's true value. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
