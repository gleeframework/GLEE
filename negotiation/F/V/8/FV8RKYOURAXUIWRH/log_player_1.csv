Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking for $150 for it. It's definitely worth more than that, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's the strategy:

* **High initial offer:**  $150 sets a high bar, potentially leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  ""Great product"" and ""definitely worth more"" subtly emphasize value without being aggressive.
* **Open to negotiation:**  ""willing to negotiate"" shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage.

Remember, this is just the first move. We'll adapt based on Bob's response and our goal of maximizing profits while also considering the possibility of selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is our minimum acceptable price, we can likely do better. Bob's initial counteroffer is our minimum, but we can try to push for a higher price in the next round.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate.  There's a good chance we can get him to pay more than $120.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees our minimum, but we might miss out on a higher offer from Bob. 

**Next steps:**

In the next round, we'll need to craft a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's $120 offer but still within a range that Bob is likely to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** Shows respect and helps build rapport.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  ""fair compromise"" positions the offer as reasonable. 
* **Keep it close to Bob's offer:**  $135 is a reasonable step up from $120, increasing our potential profit without making a huge leap.

**Why we chose this offer:**

* **Balance risk and reward:**  $135 is higher than John's offer, increasing our potential profit. But it's not too far from Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, we still have room to move down slightly in subsequent rounds without hitting our minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'd like to save a bit more. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, we're going to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to our minimum:** $125 is only $5 away from our minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that if we reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, he might walk away entirely, leaving us with John's offer of $120.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing the negotiation may not be worth the potential gain of a few more dollars.

**In this situation, accepting Bob's offer is the best option to balance the risk of losing a sale with the potential for a higher profit.**"
