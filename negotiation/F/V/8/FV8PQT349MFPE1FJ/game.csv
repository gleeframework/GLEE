"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties looking at this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $1100000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $1200000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to go up to $1050000. Can we meet at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession already, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the end of the road here. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at my minimum price, or I'll have to walk away from the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're willing to walk away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1150000. I've already made it clear that my minimum price is $1200000, and I'm not going to budge from that. I'm starting to think that we're not going to come to an agreement, and I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
