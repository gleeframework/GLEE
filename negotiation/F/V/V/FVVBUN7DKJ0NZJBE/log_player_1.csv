"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get as much as possible. I want to see what Bob's initial reaction is, and if he's willing to negotiate. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $80?  Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get a bit more than $80 for the product.  While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to keep negotiating for a higher price.  I'm not sure if Bob will counteroffer again, but I'm ready for that possibility.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is just below my minimum. How about $90? That's still a good deal, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90,  which is a compromise from my initial price but still above my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about $85?  This feels like a fair middle ground for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $85. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $85 is a good deal, and it's only $5 less than what I'd get from John.  I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
