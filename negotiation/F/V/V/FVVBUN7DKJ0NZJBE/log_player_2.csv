"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to pay up to $100, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. It's too early to accept Alice's offer, so I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $80?  Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer ($20 lower) to signal that I'm serious about getting a better deal. 
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:**  My message expresses a desire to find a mutually agreeable price. This keeps the conversation open and avoids appearing too aggressive.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $80 is still within my acceptable range, giving me room to go higher if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is just below my minimum. How about $90? That's still a good deal, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum, I'm still not ready to commit. I can try to get a lower price by counter-offering again.  There are still several rounds remaining, so there's room for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about $85?  This feels like a fair middle ground for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental counteroffer:** I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount ($5) this time, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing $85 as a ""fair middle ground"" to appeal to Alice's sense of compromise.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging to maintain a good rapport with Alice."
