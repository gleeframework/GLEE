{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my valuation and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  While I would like to sell the product, I am not willing to accept a price that is significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and agree on $11,250? Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
