"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'd like to propose a price of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe this price still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal, while also reflecting the product's true value. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1150000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1250000 is a more realistic price for this product. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
