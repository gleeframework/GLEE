"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being a fair starting point for us both.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your need to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's work towards a deal at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've made a significant concession by offering you the product for $1,150,000, and you're still not willing to meet me at a higher price. I'm starting to think that we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. However, I'm willing to make one final attempt to reach a deal. I can offer you the product for $1,120,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
