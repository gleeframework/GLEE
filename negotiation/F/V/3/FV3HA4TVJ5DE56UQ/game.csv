"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $10500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11800. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",11800.0,Alice,3,
