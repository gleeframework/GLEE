Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will counter his offer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. John is already willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
