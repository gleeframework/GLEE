"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice's minimum is likely around $1,200,000, there's room for both sides to find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to secure a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a better deal. It's possible that Alice might be willing to lower her price further.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,325,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to try to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,325,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than his initial budget of $1,500,000 and allows him to save $180,000.  While a bit more negotiation could potentially save Bob another $20,000, there's a risk of Alice backing out of the deal or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer at this point minimizes risk and secures a good deal."
