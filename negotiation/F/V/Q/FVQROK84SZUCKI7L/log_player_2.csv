"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product ($1,000,000), it's still lower than what you'd pay John ($1,200,000). Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
