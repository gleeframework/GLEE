Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim higher with Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 gives you the potential to earn an extra half a million dollars.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, attempting to justify the higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential reward of a significantly higher sale price outweighs the risk of going straight to your backup buyer."
