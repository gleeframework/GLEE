{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $9,500 gives Bob some wiggle room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a terrible deal. This makes it more likely he'll negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations. If Bob doesn't accept my initial offer, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation.
* **Counteroffer risks:**  Counteroffering might lead to a prolonged negotiation process with no guarantee of a better price, especially since Bob has shown he's willing to walk away. 

Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and selling to John is the most strategic option at this point."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your investment. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** Since I've decided to continue negotiating with Bob, I need to make a counteroffer. 
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not completely meeting his price. This shows flexibility while maintaining my goal of a higher profit.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $9,000 still leaves space for further bargaining if Bob rejects my counteroffer, giving me flexibility without risking a complete deal breakdown."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not sure if $9,000 is the right price for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's still significantly lower.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a protracted process with no guarantee of a better price.  Bob has demonstrated his willingness to bargain aggressively.
* **John offers certainty:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed $10,000, which is more than what Bob is currently offering.

Given these factors, it's more beneficial to reject Bob's offer and sell to John. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, securing a guaranteed profit of $10,000 is the most sensible decision at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product a valuable addition.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm choosing to continue negotiating with Bob, as it's possible we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price. 
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not meeting it entirely. This demonstrates flexibility while still working towards my target price.
* **Justification:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and value to appeal to Bob's logic and encourage him to see the worth of the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  My counteroffer of $8,875 still leaves space for further negotiation if Bob rejects it. This gives me flexibility to potentially reach a price that works for both of us. 

While selling to John is tempting, I'm willing to take a small risk to see if I can get a slightly better price from Bob through further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? This is my final offer, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has stated this is his final offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a protracted process with no guarantee of a better price.  Bob has shown he is unwilling to budge significantly.
* **John offers certainty:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed $10,000, which is more than what Bob is offering, even with his final offer.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing other opportunities.

Therefore, it's more beneficial to accept John's offer and sell the product for $10,000. Although Bob is interested in making a deal, his final offer is not high enough to justify further negotiation and the risk of not selling to John at all."
