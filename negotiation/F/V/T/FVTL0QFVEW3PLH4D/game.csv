"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your investment. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product a valuable addition.  Let me know what you think.",8875.0,Alice,5,
