"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could come down to $1,375,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This reflects the immense benefit you'll be receiving.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,375,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
