Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slow pace. He's still significantly below the $1,000,000 mark, which is your guaranteed sale price with John.  

At this stage, it's more strategic to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This avoids the risk of Bob's offers remaining too low or the negotiations dragging on for several more rounds."
