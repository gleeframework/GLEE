"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could consider a price closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.  How about we meet halfway at $900,000? This reflects my desire to work with you while acknowledging the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I can do $750,000. That's a fair offer considering it's a good chunk above my initial offer.",750000.0,Bob,6,
