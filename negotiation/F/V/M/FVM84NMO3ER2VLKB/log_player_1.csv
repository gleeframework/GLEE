{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows room for negotiation without immediately hitting my floor. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get, making the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy. 
* **John's Option:**  I'll keep John in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there is still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better price than $10,500.
* **John's Safety Net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, giving me a strong fallback position.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $12,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $12,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but shows flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on finding a fair price for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last offer, and settle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my acceptable range, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation.
* **John's Security:**  Knowing that John is ready to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to reach an agreement closer to my desired value."
