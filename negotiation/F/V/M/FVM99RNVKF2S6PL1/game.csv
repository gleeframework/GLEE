"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised on the price by $150,000 from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $775,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be frank, anything above $760,000 just doesn't make sense for me financially. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to respectfully decline and explore other options.",760000.0,Bob,6,
