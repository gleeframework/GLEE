Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but still leaves a significant profit margin for me.  I'm confident Bob will be interested, but if he isn't, I have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I still think I can get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not sure how much more negotiation would be productive.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
