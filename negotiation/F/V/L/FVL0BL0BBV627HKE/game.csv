"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we aim for $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're not making much progress here.  I'm willing to bump my offer to $10,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering your initial asking price and the value it holds for me.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value I've put into this product. How about we aim for $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be realistic. My budget is firm, and I can't go any higher than $10,500. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be realistic, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I've been very clear about my budget constraints. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,500. Take it or leave it, I'm done here.",10500.0,Bob,10,
