"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $1600000 for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000.

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1650000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.
