"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $15,000. This is a high starting point, but it allows for room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. 

I also recognize that I have a backup option with John, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my price to $12,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. This counteroffer should gauge if Bob is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle.  It also keeps the pressure on him, as he knows I have a backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  It's better to continue the negotiation and see if I can push Bob a little higher. I'm confident that with more rounds, I can get a better deal. It's still better than selling to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my price to $11,000, getting closer to Bob's offer.  This demonstrates that I'm flexible and willing to find a solution that works for both of us. It's also still above my minimum price of $10,000.  This is a strong position, as I can always accept John's offer if Bob continues to refuse."
