{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Alice and Bob, there's potential for a deal that benefits both parties.  By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can open the door to a potential lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a price that Alice might be willing to consider, given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to her.  It's a good starting point for negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer. While $1,190,000 is a better price than her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a lower price.  I have 7 rounds remaining, so I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,150,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still trying to get a good price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now only $20,000 away from my counteroffer. It's worth continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to pay a little more, but I'm confident I can get a better price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1160000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,160,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still trying to get a good price.  We are getting closer to an agreement, and this counteroffer is a reasonable step towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has only moved up by $500 from her previous offer.  I'm now within $20,000 of my initial counteroffer and only have 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing.  The $1,180,500 price is still a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than John's price."
