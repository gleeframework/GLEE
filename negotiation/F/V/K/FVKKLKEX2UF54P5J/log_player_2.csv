"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for a price closer to his desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his desired value as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer that is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation. This also shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is very close to Bob's ideal price point.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential benefit of a few hundred dollars in savings. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
