Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately turned off by the high price, you know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, it suggests he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have the backup option of selling to John for $120, so you're not desperate and can afford to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $120, so there's no need to settle for less.  You'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This counteroffer shows Bob you're willing to move from your initial price, but not drastically.  
* **Staying Above Minimum:** You're still aiming for a price higher than your minimum ($120) to maximize potential profit.
* **Encouraging a Response:**  This offer encourages Bob to counter again, keeping the negotiation alive. He might be willing to go slightly above his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $130. Would you consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 now matches your minimum acceptable price and the amount John is willing to pay.  There's no benefit to further negotiation or risking losing Bob as a buyer. Accepting this offer secures you the best possible outcome."
