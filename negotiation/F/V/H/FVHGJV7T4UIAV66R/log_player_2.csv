"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested. However, if you decline, I'll need to move on to another buyer who is willing to pay the full $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is a bad deal.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, which is less than Alice's offer. Never accept a higher price when you have a guaranteed lower price elsewhere."
