Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($120) and to Bob ($120). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum.  I'm confident Bob will at least counteroffer since he values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $110. While it's above my minimum of $120, I'm hoping for a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130. This is halfway between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $110.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise and might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $115. While it's still lower than I initially hoped for, it's above my minimum of $120 and  the negotiation seems to be stalling.  I don't want to risk further counteroffers and potentially end up selling to John for the same price."
