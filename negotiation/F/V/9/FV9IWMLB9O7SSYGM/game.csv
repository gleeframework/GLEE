"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000. Can you meet me halfway?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1400000 is below my desired range, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm prepared to reduce the price to $1750000. This price still reflects the product's significant value and offers you a considerable opportunity. Let's continue this conversation and explore a mutually agreeable solution.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at this price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
