Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is more than he's willing to pay, and he has a backup option in John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10500?  I'm confident you'll find the product worth that investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's counteroffer is still above his maximum price, and John is offering a better deal."
