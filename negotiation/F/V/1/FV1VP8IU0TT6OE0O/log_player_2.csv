Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It demonstrates a strong interest while leaving room for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $105 is better, there's still room for negotiation before going to John.  We'll counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to move a bit more."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $97? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",

This counteroffer aims for a price closer to our target while acknowledging Alice's compromise. It keeps the negotiation moving and maintains a collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll give you a slight discount and offer it to you for $102. It's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  At $102, we're getting a decent discount and it's not worth the risk of her walking away for a potential $2 savings with further haggling."
