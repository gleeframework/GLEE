"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $750,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,3,
