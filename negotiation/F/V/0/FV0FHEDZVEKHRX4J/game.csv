"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $20000. It's a great deal considering its potential worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 at this time. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8000 is unfortunately too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $12000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to make a decision based on your response.",12000.0,Bob,4,
