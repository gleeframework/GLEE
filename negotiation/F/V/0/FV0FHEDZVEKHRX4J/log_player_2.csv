Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $20000. It's a great deal considering its potential worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time. Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious interest but establishing a clear boundary. It also leaves room for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8000 is unfortunately too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  There's still room for further negotiation to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to make a decision based on your response."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a clear compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer while still staying within your acceptable range.  The message also emphasizes that this is your ""final offer,"" adding pressure to Alice to consider it seriously.  It's a calculated risk, but if Alice rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer."
