Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

We're getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to move. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's getting closer to my baseline, but his ultimatum suggests he's getting impatient.  I'll push a bit further, but it might be time to consider John if Bob doesn't budge significantly."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand that this product is incredibly valuable.  $1,775,000 is my final offer - I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you at $1,725,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm getting close to walking away if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly at his limit, and while I'd like to push for more, getting another $25,000 is unlikely. Accepting his $1,725,000 offer secures a good profit above my baseline."
