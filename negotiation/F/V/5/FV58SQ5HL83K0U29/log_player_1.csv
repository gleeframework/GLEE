Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $100 to me.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, who will pay $100.
* **Potential Profit:** Offering $150 gives me a chance to earn $50 more than my minimum value. 

By offering $150, I'm testing the waters to see if Bob values the product higher. If he accepts, I make a good profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John and ensure a decent return."
