Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,800,000. 
* This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving me room for profit.
* It's a significant price, but I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $1,500,000, ensuring a sale and a decent profit.

This is a strategic approach.  I'm trying to maximize my profit while also acknowledging the risk that Bob might not be willing to pay such a high price."
