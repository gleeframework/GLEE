"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $9,800. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,200. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I think it's worth considering.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still sticking to your offer of $8,500, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  $9,000 is closer to what he's willing to pay, but he can still try to get it lower. He's still got 3 rounds left, so there's time to see if he can get Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9,000 is a better offer, I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my previous offer of $8,500.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to pay $8,750.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to reach a price he's comfortable with. He's offering a price that's a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. He's hoping this will convince Alice to accept, as he only has two rounds left before he's forced to choose John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to get a deal with Alice before he's forced to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $8,900 is only $400 more than Bob's last counteroffer and is a much better deal than what John is offering.  It's time to close the deal and secure the product at a price that's still a good value."
