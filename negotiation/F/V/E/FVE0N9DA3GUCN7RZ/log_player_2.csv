"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I value at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a great deal for you, as you value it at $100, and for me, as I'm confident I can sell it to someone else for $100.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
