Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get as much as possible. However, I'm aware that Bob is likely to counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob $10,500. This is closer to what I'm willing to accept, and I'm hopeful that it will be agreeable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is too far below my minimum threshold.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
