"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this unique product to you. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's budget ($2,200,000 vs. $800,000). It makes sense to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,200,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, the value of this product far exceeds $800,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement, but I need a price within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, and I recognize your commitment to finding a solution. Let's meet halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,500,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still way above Bob's budget.  While it seems they are getting closer, the negotiation is taking longer than expected. Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $800,000,  it's the most logical decision to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at a much lower price."
