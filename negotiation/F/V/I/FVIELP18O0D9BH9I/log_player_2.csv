"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm interested in buying the product, but I'm trying to save as much money as I can. Since Alice is willing to sell it to me for $140, which is $10 less than what I'm willing to pay, I think I'll accept her offer.
