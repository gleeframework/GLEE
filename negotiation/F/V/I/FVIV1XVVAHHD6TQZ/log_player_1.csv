Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell for $750,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit further.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $825,000 is a good deal considering Bob's budget.  It's closer to my initial offer and a significant improvement over his previous offer.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and would be happy to sell for this price."
