Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  The ideal scenario is to sell to Bob for more than $1,000,000 but less than or equal to $800,000.

**Possible Offer Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can take a slightly bolder approach with Bob. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You start high ($1,200,000) to gauge Bob's reaction and leave room for negotiation.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting exclusivity can make the offer more appealing.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Focus on the benefits to Bob, not just the price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Ending with ""Let me know your thoughts"" encourages Bob to counter-offer and keeps the negotiation open.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject your initial offer. 
* **Your Walk-Away Point:** Remember, your absolute minimum is $1,000,000. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet a price that's beneficial for you. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore other offer strategies or scenarios!"
