,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product is $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's a win-win situation for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $100, which is the market value of the product? It's a fair price and would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
