I believe its true worth exceeds $1000000, but I am willing to consider a reasonable offer from someone who appreciates its significance.

This is a significant discount, allowing you to secure an asset that could potentially appreciate in value over time. I understand that the value of such a product may be subjective, and I am open to discussing the price if you feel it needs further negotiation.
