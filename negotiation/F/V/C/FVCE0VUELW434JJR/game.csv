"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000, which would be $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
