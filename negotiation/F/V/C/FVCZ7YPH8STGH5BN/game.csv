"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value this product brings, especially tailored to your specific needs, is far greater. I can come down to $1,025,000, which I believe is a very competitive offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I respect your position, but calling $925,000 your 'final offer' seems premature.  We're both aware of the significant value here. Let's land on a win-win - how about $985,000? This reflects my willingness to find common ground, while still recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering.",985000.0,Alice,5,
