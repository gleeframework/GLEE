"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something I've been working on for a long time, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me, but I believe in the potential of our partnership. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
