I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's a strong starting point, giving me a good chance of getting a price closer to my desired $1,500,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to get the sale done, I cannot accept such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves a profit margin.  I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility while remaining firm on a price that is closer to my desired value."
