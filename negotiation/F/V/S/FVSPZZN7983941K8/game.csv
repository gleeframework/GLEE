"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, but $11,500 is simply too far below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $12,500 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $12,250. Can we meet at this price?",12250.0,Bob,6,
