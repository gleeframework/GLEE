Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I think would be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than Bob's counteroffer, but I'm not going to give up too much. I'll see if I can get him closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $16,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit to $18,000 to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating and possibly get a bit more, Bob's counteroffer of $17,000 is close enough to my minimum threshold of $15,000. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal and I want to avoid the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price or losing Bob completely."
