Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Value Unknown:** Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's important to leave room for negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob.  I can always fall back on John if the negotiations fail. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter with a price closer to his offer (but still higher than John's offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is still significantly higher than John's offer, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** While accepting Bob's offer would be a quick win, I'm aiming for a higher price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's but still leaves some profit for me. 

**Next Step:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than Bob's offer (e.g., $1,450,000) to signal my willingness to compromise while still attempting to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $1,450,000, I am leaving room for potential further negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Balancing Risk:** This strategy allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's desired price while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully evaluate Bob's response. If he rejects, I will consider another counteroffer, keeping in mind the risk of losing the sale to John. However, if Bob accepts, I will have secured a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 lower than my previous counteroffer. The gap between our desired prices is closing.
* **Significant Profit:** Even at $1,425,000, I am still securing a significant profit over John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Loss:** Further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, and there's a risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away.  

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing the sale and secures a substantial profit."
