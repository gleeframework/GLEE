"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $130. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $130.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $130, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $140. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",140.0,Alice,5,
