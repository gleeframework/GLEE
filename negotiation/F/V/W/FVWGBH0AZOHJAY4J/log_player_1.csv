Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It shows you're open to negotiation, but also serious about getting a good price.

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's reaction and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less profit margin. You can likely push for a higher price, especially since you know Bob values the product at $12,000. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. This shows you're willing to negotiate, but also demonstrates that you believe the product is worth more than $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still hoping to get closer to your asking price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your current offer. How about we try $10750? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is getting closer to your desired price.  While it's still lower than your preferred amount, it's a decent compromise, especially since you're already in a few rounds of negotiation. 

**Considering the Alternatives:**

* **Rejecting and counteroffering:**  There's a risk that Bob might not budge further, and you could end up in a stalemate. 
* **Selling to John:** You'd get your minimum price, but you'd be leaving potential profit on the table.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure a sale, earning a respectable profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential losses."
