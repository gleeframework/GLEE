"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $107?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit below $100 in my budget, so I can offer $102. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and it's better to secure the $102 profit than risk him walking away for a potential $2 extra from John."
