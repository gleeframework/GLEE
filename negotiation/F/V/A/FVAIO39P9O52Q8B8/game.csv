Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000. What do you think?,1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my valuation of the product at $800000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our respective valuations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1025000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your valuation. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my valuation of the product. I am unable to agree to $1025000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $975000. This still allows us to come closer together while respecting my valuation.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $975000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1015000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
