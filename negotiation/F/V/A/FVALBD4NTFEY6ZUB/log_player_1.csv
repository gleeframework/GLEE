"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing it as a great deal to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers and further discussion. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still being open to a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **More rounds available:** I have 9 rounds remaining, and there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Potential for a counteroffer:**  I can make a counteroffer closer to my initial price, aiming to find a middle ground. 

While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I'm not willing to give up on potentially earning more with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500?  This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Highlight value for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that $10,500 is still a good deal for him, framing it as a win-win.
* **Maintain my bottom line:** $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,800 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I have 6 rounds left and I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob, considering his willingness to compromise. 
* **John is a secure option:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I'm still aiming for a higher price with Bob.  

While I'm open to compromise, I won't settle for a deal that significantly undervalues my product.  I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While I'm open to working with you, $9,800 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  Let's aim for a compromise at $10,200. This would still be a very good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain my bottom line:**  While $10,200 is below my initial desired price, it's still above my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Show flexibility:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on win-win:** I'm highlighting that $10,200 is still a good deal for Bob while also emphasizing the need to make this profitable for me.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that could lead to a successful deal in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to 4 rounds and the offers are getting closer to my minimum, but still not high enough.
* **Risk of losing out:**  I'm at risk of ending up with a price I'm not happy with if I continue negotiating.
* **John guarantees a good price:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value of $15,000, and it eliminates further negotiation and risk.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a mutually beneficial deal with Bob, securing $15,000 with John is a safe and financially sound decision."
