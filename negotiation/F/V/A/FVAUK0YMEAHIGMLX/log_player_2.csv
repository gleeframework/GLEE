"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to get the product for as low as possible, and $130 is still above your maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $110. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range for both of us. It's a good starting point for negotiation and will likely cause Alice to reconsider her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, I'm still not willing to pay $125. I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice, or I can buy from John for a guaranteed $120.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me more options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $115. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a better price than Alice's last offer.  It's also a good middle ground that might be acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $122 is very close to my maximum budget.  However, I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Alice is not going to go any lower.  Buying from John for $120 guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
