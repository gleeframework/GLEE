"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a middle ground!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still hesitant to reach $1050000. I would like to propose a price of $1000000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is more acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
