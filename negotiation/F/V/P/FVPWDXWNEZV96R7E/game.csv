"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $9,500 to make this work. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,250. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price we both agree on.  While $9,250 is closer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my last offer. How about we split the difference and go with $9,375? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,187.50. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9187.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  $9,187.50 is a good starting point.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,281.25. It's a small difference, and it brings us closer to a deal. What do you say?",9281.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, but $9,281.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,260.625. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9260.625,Bob,8,
