"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no reason to accept an offer that exceeds your budget, especially since you have a backup option with John."

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price point, it's still above your budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you have a guaranteed alternative with John.  You can try to meet her halfway again or propose a lower price closer to your budget."
