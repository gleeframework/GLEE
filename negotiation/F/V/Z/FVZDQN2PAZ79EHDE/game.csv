"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth considering. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $9500, which would be $10750. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to reach a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession: I'll meet you halfway between $10000 and $12000, which would be $11000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still trying to reach a deal, but I think $11000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront, as I mentioned, and I'll offer $9500 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",9500.0,Bob,6,
