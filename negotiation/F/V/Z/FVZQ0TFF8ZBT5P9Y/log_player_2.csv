"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,000,000), but still within your budget.  It's a good starting point, but there's likely room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,125,000?  I believe this still reflects a fair deal given the value this product brings.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but it's still above your ideal price point.  There's still potential for further negotiation, so rejecting her offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your target."
