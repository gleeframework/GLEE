I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profits.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, as he values the product at $1,200,000. We'll see where the negotiations take us from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,550,000, which is still above my minimum and closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough to satisfy my minimum profit requirement. John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than what I'm willing to risk for further negotiations.  It's time to end this negotiation and sell to John."
