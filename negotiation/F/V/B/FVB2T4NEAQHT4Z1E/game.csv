"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. I believe its value to you aligns perfectly with its importance to me. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1200000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value to me is not quite at $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This would allow both of us to achieve a good outcome. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $950000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $950000 still falls short of what this product is worth.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
