Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) establishes a strong anchor point. Even if he negotiates down, you're more likely to land above your minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The message implies you're open to discussion, which can be disarming for a potential buyer. 
* **Backup plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and potential counteroffers."
