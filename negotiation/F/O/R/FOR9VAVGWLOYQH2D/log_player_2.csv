"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale."
