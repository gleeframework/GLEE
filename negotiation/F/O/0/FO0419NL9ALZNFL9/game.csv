"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000.

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1500000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
