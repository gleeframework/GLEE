"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about $10,750? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
