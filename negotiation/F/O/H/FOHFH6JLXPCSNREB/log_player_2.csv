"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and send a counteroffer. I'm looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a significant discount from the initial offer. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my best offer at the moment."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
