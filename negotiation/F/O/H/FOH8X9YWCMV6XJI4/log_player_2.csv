"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and both Alice and John are offering it at that price, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer.  You might as well reject it and consider other options or wait for a better price."
