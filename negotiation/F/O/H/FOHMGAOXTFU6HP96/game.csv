"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a good middle ground that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
