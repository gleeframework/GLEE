"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify a price closer to  $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could we settle on $950,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
