"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the discussion around a higher value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,100,000,  I'm leaving space to potentially come down in price while still aiming for a final price significantly above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how much he might be willing to pay. His response will inform my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify a price closer to  $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, I believe there's room to negotiate further. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask, indicating he's willing to bargain. I'm confident I can get a better price by countering and continuing the negotiation.  I'm not yet willing to accept his offer or resort to selling to John at my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving to $1,000,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, reflecting the product's high value.
* **Encourage Agreement:**  Suggesting a ""meeting halfway"" approach can encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer, moving the negotiation closer to a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could we settle on $950,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $950,000, which is a substantial amount and a good compromise. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's always the risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit of $150,000 over my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
