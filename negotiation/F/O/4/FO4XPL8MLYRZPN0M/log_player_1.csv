Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 gives you the potential to make a $300,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate if he's truly interested.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This strategy assumes you don't have extensive information about Bob's financial limits or how much he might value the product beyond $1,200,000. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might adjust your opening offer to be slightly less aggressive."
