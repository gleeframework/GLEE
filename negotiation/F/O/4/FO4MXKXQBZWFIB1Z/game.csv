"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. I'm still a little hesitant at $9,000.  Let's split the difference - $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $9,200, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make it work.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're very close! $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go to $8,900. Let's make this deal happen!",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're really close now, Bob! I can see you're making a strong effort to get the deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, but that's as low as I can go. Let's shake on it!",9100.0,Alice,7,
