Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice, potentially ending up with a higher price or missing out on the product altogether.  Buying from John guarantees you the best price you're willing to pay."
