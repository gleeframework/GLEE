**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's limit.  Continuing to negotiate is likely to be a long process, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product at his maximum price, saving time and potentially further negotiation fatigue."
