"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth more than you realize.  Let's start with this offer and see where we can go from here.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my price. I'm proposing $950000. Let's keep the negotiation going and find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit above where I'm comfortable.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to be closer to $950000. How about $925000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $912500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both get what we need.",912500.0,Bob,6,
