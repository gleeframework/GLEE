"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider the price.
* **Open Ended:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for counteroffers and keeps the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. While $100 is a decent price, I believe I can still do better. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Bob's counteroffer leaves room for me to negotiate.  
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not yet desperate enough to accept John's offer of $80. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial asking price, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Value Proposition:** I remind Bob that $110 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's value.
* **Clear Price:** I'm stating a specific price to keep the negotiation focused."
