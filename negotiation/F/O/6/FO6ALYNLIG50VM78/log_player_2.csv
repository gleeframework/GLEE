"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$120 is too high for me.** I'm willing to pay no more than $150, and Alice's offer is already close to that. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** I have 10 rounds, so I can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly find a price that's in both of our ranges.
* **Justified offer:** $100 is still well within my budget and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm being polite while still stating my position clearly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $110 is a reasonable compromise, especially since I have 10 rounds to negotiate.
* **Good deal:**  $110 is a good price for me, as it's still under my budget.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting avoids further negotiation and saves time."
