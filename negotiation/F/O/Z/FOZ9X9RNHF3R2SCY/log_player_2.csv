"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still worthwhile to see if I can get it for even less. I'm not yet sure of the product's value to Alice, so I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating and gives Alice some room to counter without feeling like I'm disrespecting her offer.  I'm aiming for a price that's still a good deal for me, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. However, I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer. $110 is still a good price for me, and I'm not sure I can get it much lower.  Since I'm within my budget, I'll accept her offer.  I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy this product at a good price, especially with John's offer still available."
