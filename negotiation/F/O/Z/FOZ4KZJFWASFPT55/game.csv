,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider a price of $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline at $1350000. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet that price. I would like to continue our discussion and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my maximum offer of $1200000. Could you consider revising your offer to accommodate my budget?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your financial constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to continue the discussion. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1300000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $1300000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1250000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final counteroffer of $1250000, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that it's going to be a profitable deal for me. I'll meet you at $1260000, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
