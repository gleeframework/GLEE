"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $120 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50?",122.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $122.50 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle again at $123.75.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product.",123.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I can go as high as $123.75. How about we try $123?,123.0,Bob,6,
