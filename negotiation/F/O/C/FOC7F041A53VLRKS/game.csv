"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. How about considering $132 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us.",132.0,Bob,4,
