"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth to me. How about we set the product price at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still allows me to get a good return while giving you a fair price.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your position, but I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about we set the product price at $825,000? It's slightly above your last offer but still below the original price. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",825000.0,Bob,4,
