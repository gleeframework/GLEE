"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $8,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're the only interested buyer right now. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a great product at a price I can afford. Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $9,250? This would be a great compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.  Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Bob,6,
