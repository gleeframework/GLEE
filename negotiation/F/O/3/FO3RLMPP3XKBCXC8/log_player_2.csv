# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it at an exclusive price of $100. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best value while also allowing me to share in the product's worth. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than John's price of $120, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. She might be willing to lower the price further to make a sale."
