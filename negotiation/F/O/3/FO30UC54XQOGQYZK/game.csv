"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
