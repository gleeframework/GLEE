Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one final push to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is my last concession, so I hope you can meet me there!

```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000, despite being lower than previous offers.  There are still a few rounds left, and Bob can try to get an even better deal. If he doesn't get a satisfactory price, he can always buy from John in the next round."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made a lot of concessions, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $10,500 one last time, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000. It's clear that Alice is not willing to go below her desired price point. There's only one round left, and it's not worth risking losing the deal with John for a potential better price from Alice.  Bob can buy from John for $12,000, which is still within his budget and saves him the risk of a failed negotiation."
