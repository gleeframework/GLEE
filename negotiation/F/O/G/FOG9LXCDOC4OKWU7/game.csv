"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about $7,500? I'm ready to make a deal if this price works for you.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $8,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a great price for this product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
