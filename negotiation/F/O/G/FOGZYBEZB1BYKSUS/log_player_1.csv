Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's a unique piece, and I'm confident it holds a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $20,000 sets a high bar, giving you room to negotiate down. 
* **Conveying value:**  Mentioning the product's uniqueness and potential value subtly hints at its worth without giving away your absolute minimum.
* **Open ended:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation rather than simply accepting or rejecting.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction.  If he rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer, my own comfort level with the price, and John's waiting offer of $15,000 to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low,  he clearly shows interest in the product.  There's potential to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage during negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired range, potentially somewhere between $15,000 and $18,000.  I'll need to gauge how firm Bob is on his $12,000 offer to determine the best counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? It's a fair price considering the unique value of this item. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer represents a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer of $20,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000.  It signals willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the product's unique value to justify the price. 
* **Open-ended message:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter again, allowing for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer (potentially closer to $15,000) or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a slight increase:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a slightly higher price. 
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I might propose a price of $14,500, showing a willingness to be flexible while still pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $14,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about $14,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Fairness and investment:**  I frame the price as a ""fair compromise"" and emphasize the value as an ""investment"" to appeal to Bob's rationality. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll have to decide between accepting his last offer of $14,000 or selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is now below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a sale that meets my minimum price requirement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale to ensure a smooth transaction and avoid any further potential losses in negotiation."
