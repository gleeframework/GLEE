"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $14,000 is close, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum value of $15,000. I think I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is very close, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While Bob is willing to go up to $13,500, that's still below my minimum value. John is willing to pay my minimum value, so it's a better deal for me to sell to him."
