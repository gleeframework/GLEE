"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? That's the best I can do.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is very close, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",13500.0,Bob,6,
