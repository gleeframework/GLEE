``` 

This offer starts at a point where I'm getting a decent profit, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing your product, but I can only offer $9,500. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my goal, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to accept $9,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9750}
