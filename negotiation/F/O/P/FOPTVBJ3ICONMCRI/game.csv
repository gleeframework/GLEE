"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to get a reasonable price.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
