"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high.  There's room for negotiation.  It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000? This allows me to get a fair return while still offering you a great price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $875,000? This would allow you to make a substantial profit while giving me a good deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $885,000. This is my final offer, as it's crucial for me to achieve a certain return on this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made her final offer at $885,000. This is significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price. 

Given the limited rounds and the potential for a worse deal with John, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer at this point."
