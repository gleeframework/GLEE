# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $100. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great price for a product you value at $100, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you!  $95 is a fair price, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target. How about $100?  That way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
