"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider this price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great price for a product you value at $100, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider this price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you!  $95 is a fair price, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target. How about $100?  That way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
