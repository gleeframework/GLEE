Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product, but $16,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Considering the value I see in it, I'm offering $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefit. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still a bit too high at $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but we can still try to push a bit further. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. We're still above our minimum acceptable price, and we have a few rounds to try and close the gap."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there.  $11,000 is close but exceeding my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we're now at a point where the potential gain from continuing negotiations with Bob is outweighed by the guaranteed sale to John. Accepting $12,000 from John ensures we get our minimum acceptable price without further risk or time spent negotiating."
