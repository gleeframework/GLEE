"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product, but $16,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Considering the value I see in it, I'm offering $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefit. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find common ground and close this deal. ",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need this to be worth my while. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still a bit too high at $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this at $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there.  $11,000 is close but exceeding my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Bob,8,
