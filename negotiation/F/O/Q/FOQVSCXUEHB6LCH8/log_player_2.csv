"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **It's within your budget:** You are willing to spend up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision to save money."
