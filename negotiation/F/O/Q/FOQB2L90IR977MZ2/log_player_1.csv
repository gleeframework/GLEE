Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity and I think you'll be thrilled with it."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum.  This leaves room for potential bargaining and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more to others.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, there might be factors you're unaware of that could make him willing to pay a premium (e.g., urgency, lack of alternatives).
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
