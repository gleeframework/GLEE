"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product more.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room to potentially lower the price if Bob counters, while still getting a good profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to engage.

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes negotiation. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to potentially get closer to the product's true value. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and how many rounds remain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $8000.  This product is worth that to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $8,000 is my minimum, and I'm not willing to settle for that right away. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore getting a higher price.
* **Time is on my Side:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to be patient and try to get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his. This shows I'm open to negotiation, but also that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I'm lowering my price to show I'm willing to negotiate, but not by much.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" to emphasize a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

By taking a smaller step down in price, I'm hoping to get closer to a deal while still maintaining a comfortable profit margin. I'll keep a close eye on Bob's response to see if this counteroffer is enough to close the deal or if further negotiation is required."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Goal:**  $9,000 is very close to my desired profit margin, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal.
* **Time is Running Out:**  I've already gone through four rounds, and time is becoming a factor. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Maintaining Relationship:** Accepting this offer maintains a good relationship with Bob, which could be beneficial for future transactions.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to get closer to $10,000, I'm willing to compromise to close the deal.  This offer is a good balance between getting a decent profit and ensuring a sale."
