{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at Bob's maximum valuation ($12,000) might make him feel cheated and less likely to accept. 

By setting the price at $11,500, Alice increases her chances of a sale while still securing a significant profit above her minimum acceptable price ($10,000)."
