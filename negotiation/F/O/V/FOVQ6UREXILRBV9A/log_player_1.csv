Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to find a price that works for both of you.
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting too high could scare Bob away. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my goal of $12,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strong justification:**  I've highlighted the value of the product to Bob to emphasize why my counteroffer is still reasonable.
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on finding a solution that works for both of us, fostering a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000 and it shows that Bob is serious about buying the product. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
