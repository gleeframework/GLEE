"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a little below what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider my revised offer?",92.5,Bob,4,
