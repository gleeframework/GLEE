Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $12,000 value as possible.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy it for $12,000 provides a safety net. You won't accept anything less from Bob.
* **High but Appealing:** $11,999 is a high price, but it leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight discount. The odd number makes it feel less like a rounded estimate and more like a carefully considered price. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. However, it positions you to maximize potential profit while still having John as a backup buyer."
