"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  It's  significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it allows me to achieve a strong profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price of $1,000,000.  I can potentially save more by negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low.  $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me to sell this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you. It's a significant profit for you, and we can both walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above my target price of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to pay more than $1,050,000 at this point.  I'll counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is just below my counteroffer of $1,075,000.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to my target of $1,000,000,  it's a good deal for me. I'm saving significantly compared to buying from John.   It's worth it to accept the offer and end the negotiation."
