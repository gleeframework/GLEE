"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that $9,000 is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to get a good price for your product while staying within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",10000.0,Alice,5,
