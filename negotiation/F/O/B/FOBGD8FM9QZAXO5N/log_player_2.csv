"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's offer is a significant move, but still within a reasonable range. It shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a better deal. 
* **Sets the Stage:** This counteroffer establishes a negotiation range, and provides a clear starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's preferred price of $11,000, and it's still a good deal considering the product's value to Bob. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 10 rounds, accepting this offer is a smart move. It's unlikely Bob will get a significantly lower price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Risk of John:** Buying from John for $15,000 is a higher risk, as there's no guarantee Bob will get a better deal with Alice."
