"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially offering it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your lower value. Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This price reflects the product's true value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
