Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product, based on its potential and applications, is far greater than your initial offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of what's being offered.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000

# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm proposing $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's unique value and potential.
