Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still a decent profit for me, and it might be appealing enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still too low for me. While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'll sell to John for $120 and ensure I reach my minimum price."
