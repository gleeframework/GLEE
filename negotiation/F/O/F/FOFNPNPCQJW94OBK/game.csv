"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal and I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. If you're open to that, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! $105 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $115? I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
