"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1000000.0
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,4,,
