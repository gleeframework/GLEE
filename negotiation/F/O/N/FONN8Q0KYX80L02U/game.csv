"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is too far below my expectations.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle around $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $12,500 is still quite a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000 as a final offer.  Let's close this deal, I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. I'm getting closer to my limit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? I'm eager to finalize this and get the product.",12750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to finalize this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $12,875. This is my final offer. Let's make this happen.",12875.0,Alice,7,
