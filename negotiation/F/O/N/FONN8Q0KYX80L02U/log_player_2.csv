Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is too far below my expectations.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. I'm getting closer to my limit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? I'm eager to finalize this and get the product."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're eager to finalize this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $12,875. This is my final offer. Let's make this happen.

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,875.  While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal compared to John's guaranteed price of $10,000. It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
