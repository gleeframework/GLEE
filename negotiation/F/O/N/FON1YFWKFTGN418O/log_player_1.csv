"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,600,000. This is a steal considering its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point and leaves room for potential concessions. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" I aim to justify the high asking price, even though I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room:** The high starting price allows for me to potentially negotiate down while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell at any price, which strengthens my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. I would like to counteroffer at $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is quite good, I believe there's still room for negotiation. We are early in the process, and I started high, so a rejection here is expected and keeps the negotiation moving. I'll aim to counter with a price closer to my minimum while still leaving some wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you recognize the intrinsic value of this product.  However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000. Would you consider $1,475,000? I believe this is a fair and attractive offer."",
""product_price"": 1475000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob. However, I've coupled it with a justification (""intrinsic value"") to reinforce the product's worth.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The $1,475,000 counteroffer keeps me above my minimum while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Urgency:** By suggesting this is a ""fair and attractive offer,"" I subtly introduce a sense of urgency for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to find a middle ground. I would like to counteroffer at $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 represents a significant profit margin above my $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Time Value:**  We've had four rounds of negotiation, and while I have more rounds available, securing the deal now carries value. Prolonging the process might not yield significantly better results.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or the negotiation could stall. Accepting a strong offer now mitigates this risk."
