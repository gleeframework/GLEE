"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work.  This is a great price for a product that you value at $15,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there. $13,500 is a good offer, but I need to get at least $14,500 to make this work. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping you can see the value in making this deal happen.  What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",14000.0,Bob,6,
