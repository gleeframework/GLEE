Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work.  This is a great price for a product that you value at $15,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider a fair price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find common ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there. $13,500 is a good offer, but I need to get at least $14,500 to make this work. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping you can see the value in making this deal happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
