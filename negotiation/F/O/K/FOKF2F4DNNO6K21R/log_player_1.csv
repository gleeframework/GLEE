Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but leaves room for negotiation.  By saying it's a ""great deal"" and mentioning the value, I'm trying to subtly emphasize the worth of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to sell the product, it's worth at least $12,000 to me. I'm going to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I'd need to see at least $11,500 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $11,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely or me having to sell to John for $12,000. It's also a good compromise, as Bob has shown willingness to negotiate."
