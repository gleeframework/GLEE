"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still gives you a good price, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $10,900 is my final offer. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to walk away with some profit. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",10900.0,Alice,5,
