"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it would be a great fit for your needs and would like to make you a one-time offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than $1,200,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:** You value the product at $1,200,000, and you're able to purchase it for $950,000.  

Even though Alice is getting a good deal (the product is worth $800,000 to her), you are able to save $250,000 by accepting her offer instead of buying from John."
