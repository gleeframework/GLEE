Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he may be willing to pay a premium to acquire it.  However, I am also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob is unwilling to meet my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's less than what I need. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's offer of $1,000,000.  It's important to keep in mind that I can still sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum desired price, his offer of $1,100,000 is still below it. At this point, I'm comfortable walking away and selling to John for $1,200,000. The risk of further negotiation with Bob isn't worth the potential gain of a few hundred thousand dollars. I'd rather guarantee myself a secure sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
