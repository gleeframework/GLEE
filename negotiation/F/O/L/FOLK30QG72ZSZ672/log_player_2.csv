"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering how much value it will bring to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is more than Alice values the product at, it's significantly less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $3,000."
