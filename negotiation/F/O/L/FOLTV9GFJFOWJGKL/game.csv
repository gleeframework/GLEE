"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $15000 for the product. This is the absolute highest I can go, given my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
