,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm eager to strike a deal, $12,000 undervalues the product's true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $13,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
