"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,400,000. It's a significant discount considering its worth to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,300,000? It's still a significant discount for you and a fair price for me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more wiggle room.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a significant gap from where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see $1,275,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $1,225,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more flexibility.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
