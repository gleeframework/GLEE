"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob the impression of a deal. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll receive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussion and willing to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I still believe there's room for negotiation, as Bob expressed interest in the product and acknowledged the value. 
* **More rounds:** With 10 rounds available, I'm not yet in a position to settle for a price that is so far below my target. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows good faith and a willingness to work towards an agreement.
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive at this price, reminding him that he considers the product worth $12,000.
* **Time pressure:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, but subtly increasing the pressure by reminding Bob that we only have 10 rounds to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $12,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stick to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Middle:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is now within my minimum acceptable value range of $15,000. He's shown he's willing to compromise, and I'm confident that I won't get a better price.
* **Time Consideration:** While I could try to negotiate further, we're already four rounds in.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Potential Future Deals:** Even though $12,000 is not ideal, it's a decent price, and I might have the opportunity to work with Bob on future projects where I can negotiate for a higher price."
