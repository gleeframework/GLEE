"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,3,
