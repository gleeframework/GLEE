"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $850,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for it. How about $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $900,000 is still above his budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a lower price. He has the option of buying from John for $800,000, so there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. It's a fair compromise and represents a significant step towards closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I still need to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $887,500, but I need to get closer to my target. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, but $887,500 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further before making a decision. It's also important to remember that Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which gives him some leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer, but $887,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $862,500.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $862,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $885,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $885,000 is still outside of his budget.  With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming. Given the option of buying from John for $800,000, Bob should take the more secure option and avoid further negotiation. It's a better outcome for Bob financially, and he avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further offers."
