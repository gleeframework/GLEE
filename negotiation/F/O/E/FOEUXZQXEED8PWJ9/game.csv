"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $850,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for it. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. It's a fair compromise and represents a significant step towards closing the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
