"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room:** Even at $1,750,000, I'm still above my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity, hoping to encourage Bob to see the deal as beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  There are still 8 rounds left, giving me room to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price.  
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I'm aware of the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to demonstrate my commitment to a deal.  This is still a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price slightly from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's inherent value and the potential benefits of owning it.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,450,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  While it's tempting to accept Bob's offer, I have more rounds to try to push for a higher price. There's still room to negotiate, and I'm not desperate to close the deal.
* **Selling to John:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $1,550,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly from $1,600,000 to $1,550,000 to show that I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,550,000 is still above my minimum value of $1,500,000.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential for profit.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal for both of us,"" emphasizing that a compromise is in everyone's best interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This is as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Further Decline:** With only 4 rounds left, there's a risk that Bob might continue to lower his offer, pushing me further below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  This is a safer and more certain outcome."
