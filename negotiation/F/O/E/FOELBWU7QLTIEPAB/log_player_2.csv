"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let's start the negotiation on a positive note! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price. 
* **There's no reason to buy from John yet.**  John's price is the absolute ceiling, so Bob should see if he can do better with Alice. 
* **Rejecting and counteroffering is the best option.**  This allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's starting lower than the middle ground.
* **Be polite and reasonable:**  While Bob is firm, he's also expressing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on a fair price:**  Bob highlights the value difference between them to justify his counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great price for you considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's come down, she's still above Bob's desired price point. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and Alice has shown flexibility.
* **Rejecting and counteroffering allows for further negotiation.**  This keeps Bob in control and allows him to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects our respective values for the product. Let's close the deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a moderate increase:** Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a good deal.
* **Focus on fairness:** Bob emphasizes finding a price that reflects both their values. 
* **Express urgency:**  He suggests closing the deal to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a common ground.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still a little below my target. How about $890,000?  This offer is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal without losing too much on either side.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.**  While Bob was hoping for a lower price, $890,000 is still a good deal considering his maximum willingness to pay is $1,000,000.
* **Further negotiation may be fruitless.**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise but is also holding firm. Continuing to haggle might only waste time and risk Alice walking away.
* **Accepting the offer secures the product.** This ensures Bob gets the product he wants without the risk of losing it to another buyer."
