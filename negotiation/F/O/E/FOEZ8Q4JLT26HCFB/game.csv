"Alice, $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13500 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $12750? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $14000, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
