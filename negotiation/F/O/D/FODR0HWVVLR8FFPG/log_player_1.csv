{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $150 to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him. However, I'm ready to negotiate further if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is still above my minimum value, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my original offer, to show flexibility and hopefully reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about $135? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a good value for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth $120 to you 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $132 is a good price, considering it's only $2 less than my previous offer. I'm also aware that Bob may be willing to walk away if I reject his offer again.  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal completely."
