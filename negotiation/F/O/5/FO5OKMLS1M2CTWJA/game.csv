"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $17500 to make this work. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",17500.0,Alice,3,
