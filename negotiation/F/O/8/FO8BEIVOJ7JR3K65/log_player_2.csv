Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $975,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While it is a step in the right direction, I'm not ready to accept it. I will counter with a lower price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."
