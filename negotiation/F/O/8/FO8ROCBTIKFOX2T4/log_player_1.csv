Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  This gives me the best chance of getting a price I'm happy with while still keeping the door open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and also below what John is willing to pay. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
