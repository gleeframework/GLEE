Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob.  
* **Aiming for Above Bob's Value:**  The goal is to get Bob to pay more than his perceived value ($10,000). A starting price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be higher than what Bob initially thinks, potentially justifying the price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have some leeway to go down in price, knowing you have a backup buyer."
