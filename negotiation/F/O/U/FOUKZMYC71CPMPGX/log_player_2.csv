"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
