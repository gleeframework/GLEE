Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Confidence:**  The message implies the product's value without explicitly stating Bob would be getting a ""deal."" 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We don't know Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay over his perceived value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will outright reject the offer, and you'll miss out on potentially earning more than $15,000. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price is there."
