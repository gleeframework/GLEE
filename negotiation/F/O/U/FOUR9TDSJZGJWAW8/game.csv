"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's agree on $1,150,000. This reflects the product's value while still offering you a considerable gain.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
