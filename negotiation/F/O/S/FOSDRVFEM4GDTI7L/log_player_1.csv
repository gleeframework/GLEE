Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a very special price. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. That's a great deal, and it's still a good price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $12,000. This is higher than Bob's value of $8,000, but lower than my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""special price"" and highlighting the value to Bob. This might encourage him to consider the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting it with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John.  While I could offer a lower price and increase the chance of Bob accepting, I'm prioritizing maximizing my profit.  If Bob rejects, I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum value."
