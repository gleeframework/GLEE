Round 4
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers and we're getting closer to my minimum price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still thinking $1,275,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently increasing his offer, and we're now at $1,275,000.  While I could push for a slightly higher price, the difference is becoming less significant, and there's a risk that Bob will walk away if I push too hard. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale to Bob altogether."
