"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I think you could be the perfect fit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, you can potentially get it for even less. You can counteroffer and see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

You should accept Alice's offer.  You're able to get the product for $1,075,000, which is still less than the $1,000,000 you would pay John.  There's no guarantee that you could get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
