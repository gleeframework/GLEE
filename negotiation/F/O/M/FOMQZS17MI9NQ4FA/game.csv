"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value the product holds for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
