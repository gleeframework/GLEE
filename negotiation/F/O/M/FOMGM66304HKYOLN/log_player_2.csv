"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,500.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget of $8,000.  I'm not willing to pay that much, but I want to see if I can further negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
