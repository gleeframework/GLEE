Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,500.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise and gives you a good deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed price.  It's unlikely Bob will reach $12,000 in a reasonable timeframe.  It's better to secure the guaranteed sale with John."
