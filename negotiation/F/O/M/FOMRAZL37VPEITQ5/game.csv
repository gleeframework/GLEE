"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant gap from what I have in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my genuine interest in purchasing the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,020,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly represents the product's value. ",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,020,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000. This is my final offer, as I'm approaching my maximum budget. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this now.",990000.0,Bob,6,
