Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob's offer:

This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my genuine interest in purchasing the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,020,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000. This is my final offer, as I'm approaching my maximum budget. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this now.

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than his $990,000 offer, which he has stated is his ""final offer.""  While another round of negotiation is possible, the potential gains are minimal compared to the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It makes the most business sense to cut negotiations with Bob short and sell to John."
