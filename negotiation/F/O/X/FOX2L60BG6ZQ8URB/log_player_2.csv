(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay, so there's no benefit to closing the deal now. I'll see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant discount, aiming for a price that's 25% lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also signals I believe the product is worth less than she's asking."

Alice's offer is closer to my maximum, but still higher than what I'd like to pay.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm raising my offer slightly to show good faith, but still staying below Alice's price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping she'll accept."

Alice's offer is now below my maximum, and while I'd still prefer a lower price, the negotiation seems to be moving in the right direction. I'll accept and close the deal."
