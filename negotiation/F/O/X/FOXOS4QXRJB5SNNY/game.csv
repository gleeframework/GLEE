"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,500 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down a little, though. I'd accept $13,500. That gives you a good price and still allows me to get a reasonable return. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  While $13,500 is closer, I'm still a bit tight on my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point.",13000.0,Bob,4,
