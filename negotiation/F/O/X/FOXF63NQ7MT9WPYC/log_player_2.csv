"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  Bob wants to get the product as close to his $8,000 limit as possible.
* **Reasonable Counteroffer:** Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a deal, but it's also not an unreasonable price considering the product's value to Alice.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  The message is phrased to keep the negotiation open.  Bob expresses willingness to negotiate, but it also sets a firm stance on his initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $8,500 is below what I'd ideally like, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's closer to his limit, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  By buying from John, Bob gets the product at his maximum price point and avoids the potential of Alice rejecting another counteroffer, forcing him to pay even more."
