"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we potentially settle on $900,000?  That would work much better for me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a more comfortable price for you, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about we settle on $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there. However, to be completely transparent,  $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can justify spending on this.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a hard limit for you, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
