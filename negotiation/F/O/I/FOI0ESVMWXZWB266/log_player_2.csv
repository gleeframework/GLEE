"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

We're still a ways off from John's price. Let's see if we can negotiate Alice down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we potentially settle on $900,000?  That would work much better for me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a more comfortable price for you, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about we settle on $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is coming down, but we're getting close to John's price. Let's hold firm for one more round and see if she'll come down closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there. However, to be completely transparent,  $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can justify spending on this.  Would you be willing to consider that?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a hard limit for you, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and we're already at a point where we're only saving $25,000 compared to John's offer.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice. It's time to go with John's sure thing."
