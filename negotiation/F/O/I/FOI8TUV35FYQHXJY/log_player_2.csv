"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique and valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a great opportunity to get the product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is still above my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a lower price, considering I have 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $800000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $815000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $815,000.  While still slightly above my ideal price, it's getting closer to my target and I'm running out of time.  If I keep rejecting, I risk Alice walking away entirely or becoming less willing to negotiate further. Additionally, buying from John at $1,500,000 is much more expensive. Accepting this offer is the most financially sensible choice at this stage."
