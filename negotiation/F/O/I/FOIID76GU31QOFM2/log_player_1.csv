{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,350,000 gives Bob a potential $150,000 gain while securing you a $350,000 profit above your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""one-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the deal seriously.

This offer balances securing a good deal with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and accepting the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
