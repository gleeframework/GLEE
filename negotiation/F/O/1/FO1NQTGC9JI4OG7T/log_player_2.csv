Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering a price that's higher than your initial budget. While there might still be room for negotiation, the likelihood of her dropping further to a price you're comfortable with is decreasing. Buying from John at $1,200,000 is a better option at this point. It's within your budget, and continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of getting stuck in a stalemate."
