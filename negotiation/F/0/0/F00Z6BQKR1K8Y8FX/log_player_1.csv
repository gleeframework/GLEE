Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's value, hoping to find a middle ground. This gives me some room to negotiate down if he counteroffers. I'm also leaving the door open for John, who is willing to pay my minimum price, in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, but it's closer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round. I have some room to negotiate before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $108? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget of $100 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of needing to make a sale.  It's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing him completely.  Accepting his offer is the best option to secure a sale."
