"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We begin significantly above both Bob's valuation and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valuable.
* **Justification:** Offering a vague but positive statement about ""unique value"" and ""potential"" avoids revealing specific features while justifying the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  By stating this is an ""initial offer,"" we signal our willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.**
2. **Potentially secure a very favorable deal if Bob accepts immediately.**
3. **Set the stage for a negotiation where we can gradually lower the price while still staying above our minimum.**

Remember, we have John as a backup option, so we can afford to be somewhat bold in our initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer for the product is $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to our target, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Accepting now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. 

Here's why we reject and continue negotiating:

* **Room for Movement:** Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate above his initial valuation of $1,200,000.
* **Time Advantage:** We have plenty of rounds left, and there's no rush to settle.
* **John as a Safety Net:** We can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably.

By rejecting, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and are prepared to hold out for a better deal. We'll aim to meet somewhere between $1,800,000 and our starting price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you're serious about this product. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the significant value it offers while acknowledging your budgetary considerations."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down $100,000 from our previous offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Target:** This price point keeps us well above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and positions us for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Framing:**  We highlight the collaborative nature of the process (""find a solution that works for both of us"") and acknowledge Bob's constraints. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Maintain momentum:** We want to keep Bob engaged and prevent the negotiation from stalling.
2. **Test Bob's flexibility:** This counteroffer will reveal how much higher Bob is willing to go.
3. **Position for a favorable outcome:** We're moving towards a potential agreement while still leaving room for a final adjustment in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us. My counteroffer is $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, now at $1,750,000. However, we're still a significant $250,000 above our guaranteed sale price with John. This indicates there's likely more room for negotiation.

Here's why rejection is the best strategy at this stage:

* **Testing Bob's Limit:**  We need to determine how high Bob is willing to go. By rejecting, we encourage him to reveal his true upper limit.
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** Accepting too quickly might signal that we're willing to go even lower, potentially leaving money on the table.
* **Time is on Our Side:** With several rounds remaining, we can afford to be patient and continue strategically negotiating for a better price.

We'll use our next counteroffer to inch closer to an agreement while still aiming for a price above our absolute minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground here.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,825,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while acknowledging your offer."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Splitting:** We're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,750,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,900,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on a price above our minimum.
* **Positive Language:**  We're emphasizing progress (""finding common ground"") and framing this as a mutually beneficial ""compromise.""
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** We're still reiterating the ""product's value"" to prevent Bob from anchoring too low.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Encourage a Deal:**  The price is getting attractive enough that Bob might accept, getting us closer to a favorable agreement.
2. **Maintain Negotiation Leverage:** If he rejects, we still have room to maneuver in the following rounds without dropping below our guaranteed price with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I'm glad we're making progress. My counteroffer is now at $1,775,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,775,000 is now very close to our walk-away point ($1,500,000 with John). While we *might* be able to squeeze out a bit more in further negotiation, the risk of Bob walking away and the potential gain from a slightly higher price aren't worth it at this point.

Here's why accepting is the best decision now:

* **Strong Profit Margin:** $1,775,000 represents a substantial profit above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to push Bob could backfire, leading him to potentially reduce his offer or walk away entirely. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner rather than later allows us to utilize the funds for other opportunities. 

While we always strive for the best possible outcome, it's crucial to recognize when the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risks involved. Accepting Bob's offer secures a very good deal and ensures a successful outcome."
