Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John for $150, I think I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $175 is a reasonable offer.  It's better than selling to John for $150, and continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely."
