Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to you. My initial asking price is $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm aware that John is a guaranteed sale at that price.  There's no point in risking the negotiation falling apart further and losing time."
