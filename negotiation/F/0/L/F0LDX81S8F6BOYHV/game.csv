"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it'll be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000, reflecting its true potential.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 doesn't quite reflect the value we've both acknowledged.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the significant benefit this product will bring you. Let's work together to find a solution that's beneficial for both parties.",850000.0,Alice,3,
