"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13500.  It's worth more than $15000 to you, so this is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $15,000.
* Alice is offering it for $13,500, which is less than your valuation.
* Buying from John would cost you $15,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John."
