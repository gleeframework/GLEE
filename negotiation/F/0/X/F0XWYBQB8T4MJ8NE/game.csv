"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This is my best price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $11,500? This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
