Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable offer:** It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A higher offer could risk immediately turning Bob off.
* **It leaves room for counter-offers:** This allows for back-and-forth negotiation and potentially a mutually beneficial outcome.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while also being open to negotiation.  You can adjust the offer based on Bob's response, and always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum desired price of $12,000.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiations and potentially secure a higher price from Bob or simply move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but shows a willingness to compromise. It positions you to potentially reach a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,200 is still below your desired price, it's getting closer to your minimum.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be more time-consuming and might not result in a significantly higher price.  Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal and secure a decent profit without jeopardizing the potential sale to John."
