You can do better than $900,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's original offer, but still above her desired price.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still saving you a good amount of money."

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting progressively higher, making it clear she's unwilling to come down to a price you find acceptable. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John, even though it's more expensive, rather than risk further rounds of negotiation with Alice that could lead to an even higher price."
