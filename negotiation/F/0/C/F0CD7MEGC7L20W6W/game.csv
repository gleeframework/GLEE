"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this price.  If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000, which is still a substantial profit for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for being flexible.  While I appreciate you meeting me halfway,  $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This feels like a fair price that would allow us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
