"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's considerably below the product's true worth. To be fair, let's meet in the middle – how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still too steep for me.  Could we agree on $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm ready to be more flexible, but I need to see a more significant move on your end.  How about we land at $1,300,000? This is a substantial reduction and a fair offer considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see the value, but I have a firm budget. My final offer is $1,050,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be honest – $1,050,000 is too far off from what I need for this.  If you can meet me at $1,250,000, we have a deal.  I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
