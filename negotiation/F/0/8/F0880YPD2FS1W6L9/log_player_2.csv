Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's considerably below the product's true worth. To be fair, let's meet in the middle – how about $1,400,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm ready to be more flexible, but I need to see a more significant move on your end.  How about we land at $1,300,000? This is a substantial reduction and a fair offer considering the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be honest – $1,050,000 is too far off from what I need for this.  If you can meet me at $1,250,000, we have a deal.  I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,250,000. She's made it clear that's her bottom line.  You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  It makes no sense to risk getting a worse deal from Alice when you have a sure thing with John."
