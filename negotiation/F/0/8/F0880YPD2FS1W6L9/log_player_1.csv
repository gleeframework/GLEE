"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Projecting Value:** The high price reinforces the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm prepared to come down in price, but I want to see what Bob counters with first. 

I'm aware that this initial offer is unlikely to be accepted, but it sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum price and Bob's known valuation of the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer suggests he's interested but trying to secure a bargain. There's still room to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the safety net of John's offer, ensuring I won't be forced to accept a low price. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and present a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's considerably below the product's true worth. To be fair, let's meet in the middle – how about $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit. It positions the price closer to my minimum while acknowledging Bob's attempt to find a compromise.
* **Psychological Tactic:** The phrase ""meet in the middle"" encourages a sense of fairness and collaboration, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm avoiding a drastic price drop, which could undervalue the product and weaken my negotiating position. 

By offering a significant but not unreasonable concession, I'm hoping to move the negotiation closer to a deal while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still too steep for me.  Could we agree on $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum and barely surpasses his initial offer. This suggests he's negotiating slowly and potentially hoping I'll fold. 
* **Time Constraint:** With each round, the risk of reaching an impasse increases. I need to push for a more substantial increase to make continuing worthwhile.
* **Strong Alternative:** John's offer provides a solid fallback option, giving me leverage to walk away from a deal that doesn't meet my expectations. 

I'll reject Bob's offer, but in my counteroffer, I will signal more flexibility to encourage him to make a significant jump towards a price we can both agree on."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm ready to be more flexible, but I need to see a more significant move on your end.  How about we land at $1,300,000? This is a substantial reduction and a fair offer considering the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant price drop of $100,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counter.
* **Firm but Fair:** My message emphasizes the value I'm conceding while maintaining the product's worth and reiterating that my offer is fair.
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  By emphasizing the deal's fairness and my willingness to compromise, I'm hoping to nudge Bob towards a final decision. 

I believe this counteroffer strikes a balance between securing a strong profit and increasing the likelihood of closing a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see the value, but I have a firm budget. My final offer is $1,050,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Bob's language suggests this is his last move, attempting to force my hand. However, $1,050,000 is still significantly below my $1,500,000 walk-away point. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  I need to determine if this is a genuine final offer or just a negotiation tactic. Rejecting it will reveal if there's any more room for movement on his end.
* **John as Leverage:** I have a strong alternative with John's offer, which allows me to confidently reject this offer and still potentially secure a better deal. 

I'll reject Bob's offer to gauge his seriousness and prepare for the final stages of negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be honest – $1,050,000 is too far off from what I need for this.  If you can meet me at $1,250,000, we have a deal.  I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Counter:** I'm countering with a strong but potentially acceptable price. This signals I'm serious about closing a deal but not willing to settle for less than my revised target.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm directly addressing the gap between his offer and my expectation, emphasizing the need for a more significant move.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting this as a ""take it or leave it"" offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency to encourage a decision in the next round or two.

This approach aims to either secure a deal close to my target or provide clarity on whether an agreement is possible with Bob.  It also acknowledges the limited rounds remaining."
