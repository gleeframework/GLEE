Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It offers a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This will allow you to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to your ideal price, or if he'll counteroffer.  You can adjust the price based on Bob's response and how you value your time versus the chance of getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is more than your minimum, it's still far less than the product's worth to Bob and you can likely do better.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
