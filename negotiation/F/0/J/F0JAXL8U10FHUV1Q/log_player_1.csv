"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $85. Since $85 is higher than my minimum price of $80, I'll consider accepting his offer. However, I can also try to negotiate further to get a better price.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $87.50.
