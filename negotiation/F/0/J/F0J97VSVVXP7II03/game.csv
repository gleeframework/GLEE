"Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12000.  That still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
