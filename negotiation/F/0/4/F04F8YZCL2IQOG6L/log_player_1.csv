"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer and avoids mentioning my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Open-ended Question:** The question at the end invites Bob to respond and provides an opportunity to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While it's tempting to take $1,200,000 right now, I'm not in a rush. I have 10 rounds and the option of selling to John for the same price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to potentially get a better price.  Even if I end up selling to John, I've gained valuable information about Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting, I show Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and might be able to increase his perceived value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the unique value of this product, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing a counteroffer that's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""unique value"" of the product to appeal to Bob's interests and justify the higher price. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message explicitly seeks a ""middle ground"" to show flexibility and encourage further negotiation. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm again asking Bob for his thoughts to gauge his reaction and potential for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  However, I'm still not in a rush to sell.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  We've had several rounds of negotiation, and Bob is clearly interested in the product. I believe there's still room to increase his offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, I maintain my leverage and signal that I'm confident in the product's value. This could lead to a better offer in the next round.
* **Maintaining Options:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, which acts as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a fair price.  How about we split the difference? I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,325,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise. This might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the ""significant compromise"" on my part to highlight the value of the offer and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing ""reaching an agreement"" to create a sense of shared goal. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm again seeking Bob's feedback to gauge his interest and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my perspective. I would like to propose a final offer of $1300000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has made his final offer, and it's only $25,000 higher than my minimum acceptable price. There's limited potential for further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could keep negotiating, the risk of getting a lower price or no deal at all is increasing.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000. It's a safe and reliable option, especially considering the limited time remaining. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 4 rounds left, the possibility of getting a better offer from Bob is diminishing. 

**Conclusion:**  It's strategically better to accept the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than to risk losing the sale altogether."
