"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite a bit higher than that for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $11,500. How about we try $9,800? That's my final offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle if you're willing to come down a bit more.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,800 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,900? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
