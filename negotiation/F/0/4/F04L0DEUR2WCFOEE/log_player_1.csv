Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price that allows me to earn a decent profit while still leaving some room for negotiation with Bob. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm confident I can get a better counteroffer from him, knowing the product is worth $120 to him. However, if the negotiations drag on or become unfavorable, I can always sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $95 is a good deal. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a quick sale and a decent profit. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that the negotiations will stall or become unfavorable. It's better to secure this offer while I can."
