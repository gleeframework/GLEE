"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This still allows me to make a profit, while being a more reasonable price for you. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to come to an agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards an agreement.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get what I need, while also being within your budget.  Let's close the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
