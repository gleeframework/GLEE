"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a very competitive price, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
