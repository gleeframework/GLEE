Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I could make a deal at $11,000. What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a very competitive price, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to haggle Alice down further, $12,500 is close enough to my $12,000 limit. It's not worth the risk of her retracting the offer or me running out of rounds."
