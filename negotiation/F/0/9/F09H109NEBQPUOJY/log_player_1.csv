Bob's offer:

``` 

While we could push further, accepting $1,700,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** Even at this price, we're well above Bob's perceived value and securing a healthy profit margin.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging negotiations out risks souring the deal. Accepting shows goodwill and a desire to close.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  John's offer is secure, but there's always a slight chance something could go wrong. Taking a strong offer now eliminates that risk."
