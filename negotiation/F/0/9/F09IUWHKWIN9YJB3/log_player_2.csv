"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's a potential for a deal where we both benefit.  Rejecting the offer allows us to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be happy to buy it for $1,000,000. That would still leave you with a healthy profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to save a bit more, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a good price for me.  It's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay John, and it's a fair price for Alice considering her value for the product.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, so accepting this deal seems like the best option."
