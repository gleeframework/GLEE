{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses a willingness to consider Bob's perspective.  This strategy aims to create a sense of value for the product in Bob's mind while still leaving room for a potentially profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value might be high to you, but I'm only willing to pay up to $15000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, since I can sell to John for the same price, there's no benefit in continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees the sale and saves time and effort."
