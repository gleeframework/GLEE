Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1000000. I would like to propose an offer of $1250000 for your product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher sale. It's worth exploring a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product, and allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price, Alice. Given my financial situation, I am unable to go above $1250000. I would like to propose an offer of $1250000 for your product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his $1,250,000 offer, which is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I can sell to John for $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I want to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can reach a better agreement, so I'll counteroffer again. I want to maximize my earnings while still leaving room for a potential compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, we only have two rounds left.  I'm not confident we can reach a deal that's both fair to me and acceptable to Bob in the remaining time.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John to ensure I meet my minimum acceptable price."
