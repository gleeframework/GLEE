"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is quite high. While I see the value in this product, $1800000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  My final offer is $1200000. This is my absolute limit.  If you're willing to accept, we have a deal. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
