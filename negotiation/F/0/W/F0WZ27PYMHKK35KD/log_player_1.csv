I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him rather than John, his offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While Bob's offer is still below what I initially wanted, it's a decent price and closer to my bottom line.  It's also better than selling to John at $15,000 and I prefer to work with Bob if possible.  I'll take the deal."
