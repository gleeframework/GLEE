"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it now. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your offer. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was based on that value. To move forward, I could consider $1,150,000. This still offers you a competitive advantage while recognizing the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. I'm ready to close the deal at this price. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a million, we are still in a good position to negotiate. Accepting his offer now would be leaving potential profit on the table. We are only on round 4 out of 10, so we have time to continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to our desired outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm simply not comfortable going over $975,000. This is a very strong offer that reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget. Let's close this deal now at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer, he is very unlikely to reach $1,000,000. The increments are getting smaller, and we have a guaranteed offer from John for our desired amount. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the deal with John."
