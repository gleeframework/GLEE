"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it now. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your offer. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was based on that value. To move forward, I could consider $1,150,000. This still offers you a competitive advantage while recognizing the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. I'm ready to close the deal at this price. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm simply not comfortable going over $975,000. This is a very strong offer that reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget. Let's close this deal now at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
