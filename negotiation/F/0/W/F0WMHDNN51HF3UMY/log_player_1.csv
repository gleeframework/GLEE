Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$125 is a reasonable starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but lower than your minimum ($150).  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profit. 
* **The message is friendly and inviting:** This sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizing potential profit:** This strategy aims to get a price closer to your desired value ($150) while still being attractive enough for Bob.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  By offering a price within a reasonable range, you're less likely to immediately reach a deadlock.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This strategy allows for back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $100, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm not willing to accept that low of an offer just yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $110 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a little more. Let's meet halfway between my last offer and yours -  how about $117.50?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 117.5} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is strategic:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum than Bob's offer, but still within a reasonable range. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm lower limit.
* **Message remains friendly and positive:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Focuses on finding a compromise:**  ""Let's meet halfway"" emphasizes the idea of a win-win solution, making the offer more appealing.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that both parties are comfortable with, potentially leading to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $115 is only $5 away from my previous counteroffer of $117.50.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $150.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale.  I'm also considering that continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, and potentially ending up selling to John for $150, which would be a worse outcome."
