"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still a significant value for you, and allows me to earn a good price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is above your maximum price.  You can get the product from John for your maximum price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy."
