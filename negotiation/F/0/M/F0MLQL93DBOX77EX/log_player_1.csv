Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate.  I'm also leaving myself some wiggle room in case he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell the product for significantly less than what it's worth to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering to sell the product for $850,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it still leaves me some profit. I believe this is a fair price that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not a good enough deal for me.  At this point, I'm worried that the negotiations might drag on indefinitely.  Selling to John guarantees me a fair price and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
