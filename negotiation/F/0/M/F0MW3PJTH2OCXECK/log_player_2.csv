# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its true worth.  I understand it's a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly profitable for you. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.
