"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $10,500? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000, which is still a good price considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
