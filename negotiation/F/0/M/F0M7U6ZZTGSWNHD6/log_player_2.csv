"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price. Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows you to see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, about 25% lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my willingness to negotiate and hopefully prompts her to consider a lower price. If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue bargaining and potentially secure a better deal.  I'm confident I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about buying the product but also won't overpay.  It's a good strategy to try and meet in the middle."
