Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price ($120) creates a sense of urgency and a perceived bargain for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window open if Bob wants to negotiate, potentially getting you even closer to $120."
