# Alice's message: I appreciate your commitment to this negotiation, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to accept $695,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and the price difference is relatively small. While there's a chance to negotiate further, it's getting close to the point where the potential savings might not be worth the risk of Alice walking away or the deal taking more rounds.  Accepting at $695,000 secures a good price and avoids the need to buy from John at $800,000."
