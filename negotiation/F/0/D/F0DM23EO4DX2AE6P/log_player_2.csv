"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $90. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's better to negotiate and see if we can get a price closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product while clearly stating our budget limitations. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** Our goal is to buy for less than $80. Offering $60 gives us some wiggle room to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is my absolute minimum.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $75 is still a bit high. We're getting close to John's price, but there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $75 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $67? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 67
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're aiming for a compromise by suggesting a price directly in the middle of our last offer ($60) and her counteroffer ($75).
* **Justification:**  We're providing a reason for our counteroffer (""a fair deal for both of us"") to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Maintaining Interest:** We still want to convey that we're motivated to buy the product. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer keeps us well below John's price ($80), giving us some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $67 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $70.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $70 is a reasonable price and significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has consistently lowered her price, signaling a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a lower price (e.g., $68 or $69) might be possible, but there's a risk Alice could walk away, leaving us to pay the full $80 to John. 

At this point, accepting the $70 offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
