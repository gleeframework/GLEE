Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I believe a price of $12,000 is fair, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $12,000, you set a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's less likely they'll go below $10,000.
* **Openness:**  Saying you're ""open to hearing your thoughts"" encourages Bob to engage in negotiation and potentially reveal how much he's willing to pay.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000.  Offering it at $12,000 might seem unreasonable to him initially. 
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared to negotiate! If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $10,000 minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, which puts you in a stronger negotiating position."
