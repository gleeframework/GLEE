"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the value you place on it. However, my budget for this purchase is limited, and I am looking for a price closer to $8000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
