Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 offer is:
    * Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), leaving room for negotiation.
    * Attractively below our guaranteed sale price, incentivizing Bob to consider it.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, highlighting value and inviting discussion rather than presenting a hard ultimatum.

**Outcome:**

This approach gives Bob a chance to counter-offer, potentially leading to a sale above $1,200,000. If Bob rejects the offer, we haven't lost anything and can proceed with the guaranteed sale to John."
