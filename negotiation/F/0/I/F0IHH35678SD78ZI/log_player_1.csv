Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I appreciate your initial offer. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a tight budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 again. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and has now offered $1,200,000 twice.  We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate and we're aiming much higher. It's time to hold firm and see if he's willing to budge further."

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position.  However, I need to be upfront about the product's value. I'm willing to accept $1,225,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this is a fair deal given the potential return on investment you stand to gain."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I respect your position on the product's value. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 once more. This remains my best offer, and I hope it will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his $1,200,000 offer.  While we could push for more, we're already significantly above our minimum. It's unlikely we'll get much closer to $1,250,000 without risking the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a great profit."
