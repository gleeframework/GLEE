{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further in a subsequent negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
