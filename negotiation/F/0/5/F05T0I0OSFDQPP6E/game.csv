"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I have a budget in mind. How about $12,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  While $12,000 is an improvement, it's still a bit below what I can realistically accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $12,500? That's a good compromise that brings us closer to the middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I understand your budget, but I need to be closer to $13,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,800. It's a small step up from your offer, and it keeps us on track for a successful deal.",12800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you working with me. However, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $12,600?  That's my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",12600.0,Bob,8,
