"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) and to Bob ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the deal aspect. 
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, encouraging a back-and-forth. 
* **Leaving the door open for John:** I'm prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way and sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I believe I can't afford $9,000 right now. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  $8,000 is my absolute minimum. Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my goal, but it's still below my minimum.
* **Negotiation space:** By rejecting the offer, I keep the negotiation open and can potentially get a higher price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not risking too much by rejecting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,750. It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Re-emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'd like to keep the negotiations moving forward. Can you consider $8,600 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,600 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, meaning there are only 6 rounds left. There's a risk of losing the deal if I keep rejecting.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough that I can potentially push for a small increase in a later round. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $8,000, so accepting this offer gives me a profit."
