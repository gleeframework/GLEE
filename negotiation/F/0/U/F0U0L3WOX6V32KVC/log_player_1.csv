Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is below what I can accept. This product has significant value that I'm confident will deliver for you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a reasonable price point. We're still leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table if we accept his current offer.  We have room to negotiate and should try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal here. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. I believe this reflects the value you're getting and allows me to feel good about the deal as well. What do you say?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,090,000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,060,000? This would be a fair deal for both parties and avoids having to go to John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is very close to our acceptable range, but we still have room to negotiate. His latest offer represents a significant jump from his previous offer.  This indicates he's willing to move closer to our price point. We'll push a bit further, but selling to John is looking more appealing if we can't get closer to $1,080,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I value finding a fair deal with you, and I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle at $1,080,000?  This feels like a good compromise where we both feel good about the agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,070,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal before I need to consider John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,070,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will significantly increase his offer. 
* **Strong Offer:** $1,070,000 is a substantial profit above our minimum.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to squeeze another $10,000 out of Bob risks losing the deal entirely.  We could end up with nothing, or having to take John's offer anyway. 

It's a good business decision to accept a strong offer now rather than risk losing a substantial profit by being too greedy."
