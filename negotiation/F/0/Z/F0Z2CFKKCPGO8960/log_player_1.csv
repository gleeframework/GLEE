"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and see value in it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a much lower price.  I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get my minimum value."
