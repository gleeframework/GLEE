Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. However, it's also high enough that I still make a substantial profit. 

I'll be prepared to counter any offers Bob makes, aiming for a final price as close to $1,500,000 as possible. However, if negotiations stall, I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my initial proposal but still represents a decent profit. However, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiations moving and try to close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but not by much. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm confident in the value of my product. I believe this price will be enticing enough for Bob to consider while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price. While continuing negotiations might lead to a better outcome, the risk of further rejections and potential deadlocks is too high. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a decent profit and eliminates the uncertainties of continued negotiations."
