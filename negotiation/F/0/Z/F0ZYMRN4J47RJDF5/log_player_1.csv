Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a lower initial price, I can encourage Bob to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  I also want to keep in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come to an acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than his initial counteroffer.  It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also ensures I get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's still a good deal.  I'm willing to take the risk and accept his offer, as it's close to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially losing Bob."
