"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's better to try and negotiate a better price before accepting or selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for a better price.  I'm not going to accept yet and will try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,000? This would ensure a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not reaching my minimum.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, the negotiation will drag on, potentially ending with me getting less than what John is offering. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
