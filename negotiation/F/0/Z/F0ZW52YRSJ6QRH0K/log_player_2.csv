Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still not a price that works for me.
