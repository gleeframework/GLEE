"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I have to make a profit. I can do $135, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a great deal for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we do $130? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $118 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I may need to explore other options.",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make one last concession. I can do $125, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Alice,7,
