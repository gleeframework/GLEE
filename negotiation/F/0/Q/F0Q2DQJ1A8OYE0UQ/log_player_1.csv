Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price while still aiming for a deal. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, leading to selling to John at $1,000,000. However, the potential gain from securing a higher price from Bob outweighs this risk."
