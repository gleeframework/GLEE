Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $10,000 is a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $10,000 is still a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether or having to settle for John's lower offer."
