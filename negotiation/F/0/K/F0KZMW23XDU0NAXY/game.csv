,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair deal considering the product's worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",9500.0,Bob,4,
