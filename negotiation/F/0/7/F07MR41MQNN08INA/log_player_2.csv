Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 just doesn't work for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer again in the next round.  I'm still hoping to get the price closer to my limit of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $95 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
