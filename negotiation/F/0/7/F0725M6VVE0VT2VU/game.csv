"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for my asking price. Would you like to purchase it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from $100.  However, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $90 for the product? I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $90 is still a little above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Considering the value of the product to you, Bob, how about we settle on $89? This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price given the product's worth to you.",89.0,Alice,5,
