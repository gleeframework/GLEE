"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your company. Based on my research, I understand its worth to you is considerably higher than what I'm willing to sell it for. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price allows you a significant return on your investment while ensuring a fair deal for me. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your operations. Please let me know your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While you could try to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will agree, and you risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John."
