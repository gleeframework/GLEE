Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $7,600, which is within my budget of $8,000.  We're down to only three rounds, and while I'd love to push for a lower price, there's a risk of reaching a stalemate or having to buy from John at a higher price. It's time to secure the deal and accept the offer."
