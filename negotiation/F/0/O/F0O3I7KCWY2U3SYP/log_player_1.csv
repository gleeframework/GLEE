"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $80?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

``` 
I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer of $80. It's less than my minimum value and I think I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
