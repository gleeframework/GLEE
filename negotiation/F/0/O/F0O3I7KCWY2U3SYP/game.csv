"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $80?  It's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is my lowest price.  Let's meet in the middle!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $95 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a fair compromise considering my minimum value.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $98, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $98 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference?  $101.50 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal.",101.5,Alice,7,
