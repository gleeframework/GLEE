I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I want to see if he's truly interested in the product and what his upper limit might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm countering with $1,300,000.  This is still a decent profit for me, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's counteroffer is still too low, and it's clear that we are not going to reach an agreement. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I would prefer to get a higher price, $1,200,000 is still a good outcome, and I can move on to other opportunities."
