Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to sell for at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering it slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the chances he'll accept. A price of $130 leaves room for you to profit significantly while still being attractive to Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price attractive to Bob and one that maximizes your potential earnings."
