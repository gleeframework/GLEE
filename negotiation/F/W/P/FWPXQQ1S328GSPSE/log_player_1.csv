"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's true worth is considerably higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects its quality and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I agree the product has potential, $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. Would you consider $950,000? That's a substantial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both our valuation and John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate and time is on our side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to let go of the product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this product in your hands."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* We're getting closer to John's offer, but we're still aiming to secure a deal above that baseline.
* This counteroffer represents a substantial decrease from our previous price, signaling to Bob that we are serious about making a deal, but not desperate enough to go below John's offer. 
* This price tests whether Bob is willing to move significantly from his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for adjusting your price. I'm getting closer to what I can manage.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob is getting closer to our acceptable range, we still have four rounds left and he's moving in the right direction.  
* Accepting his offer now would leave potential profit on the table. 
* We need to signal that our previous concession was significant and we're not going to dramatically drop the price again."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting close.  However, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 for this to make sense for me. Let's make this simple â€“ $1,150,000 and we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're holding our ground close to John's offer, signaling this is our bottom line.
* **Simplified Offer:** Removing the back and forth might make Bob more decisive.
* **Urgency:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation window, and Bob should be aware that we have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  It's a fair price, and it lets us both walk away with something.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Bluff:** Bob mentioning John is likely a pressure tactic. He's trying to create a sense of urgency and competition that doesn't really exist. We know John is a guaranteed sale.
* **Not Worth the Risk:**  While $1,075,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below both our initial asking price and John's offer. The difference of $125,000 is too much to concede at this point.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John represents a guaranteed sale at our desired price. It eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing us in the remaining rounds."
