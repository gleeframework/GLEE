Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me some wiggle room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to potentially entice Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to find a price point that's acceptable to both of us, ideally closer to my desired price. 
* By leaving room for negotiation, I'm hoping to avoid having to sell to John, which would be less profitable. 
* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit too steep for me right now.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.** Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **There's still potential for negotiation.**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it's clear he's interested in the product. I can try to reach a more favorable price with a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** However, I'd prefer to see if I can secure a higher price with Bob first. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob,  I appreciate you taking the time to counteroffer. $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $100, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $60.  
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to show flexibility and maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Strategy:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm aiming to close the gap and find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have to make a profit, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.** While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob seems to be willing to compromise, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.**  

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $130 or $100.  I will try to emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to work with him to reach a fair agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $75 is still a bit low for me, but I want to make this work. How about $90?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $75.
