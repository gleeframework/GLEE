Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob,  I appreciate you taking the time to counteroffer. $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $75 is still a bit low for me, but I want to make this work. How about $90? It's a fair middle ground, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and I'm trying to stay below $80.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John."
