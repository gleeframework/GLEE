"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit too steep for me right now.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob,  I appreciate you taking the time to counteroffer. $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you have to make a profit, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $75 is still a bit low for me, but I want to make this work. How about $90? It's a fair middle ground, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us! ",90.0,Alice,5,
