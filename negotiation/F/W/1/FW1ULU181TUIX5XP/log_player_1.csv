Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me some room to negotiate and still make a decent profit. I'm also being friendly and engaging in the message, hoping to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and go for $82.50? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll love the product!"", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $78? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's getting close, but I'm not sure I can get him to budge further. Since I can sell to John for $80 right now, I'm going to take that option to ensure I get my minimum price."
