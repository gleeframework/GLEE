"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This will allow me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially make some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking $8000 is a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge from his price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that I'll run out of rounds and be forced to accept his offer.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so that's the safest choice."
