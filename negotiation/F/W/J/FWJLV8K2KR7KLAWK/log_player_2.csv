Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price point. Would you be willing to meet me at $11500? This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still within your budget and a decent deal. 
* While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next offer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a significantly higher price.
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking a higher cost."
