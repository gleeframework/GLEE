"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $12500. Can you consider this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not at a comfortable price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $14000. Can you consider my offer of $13000?",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $13000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $14500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $12000. I'm starting to think that buying from John for $10000 might be a better option for me. Can you meet me at $12000 or I'll have to walk away?",12000.0,Bob,8,
