"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's definitely below its true value, but also a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together - I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal for Bob:** $12,000 is significantly less than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer:**  While Bob could reject and potentially find a lower price from John, there's no guarantee.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Alice's offer is a safe bet, ensuring Bob gets the product at a good price without the risk of having to pay John's higher price."
