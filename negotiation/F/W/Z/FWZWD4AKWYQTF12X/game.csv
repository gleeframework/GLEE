"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a bit closer to what we're looking for.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. That way, I can still get a good deal on the product, and you'll still get a decent price for it.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go lower than $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're serious about buying it, let's meet at $90.  Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm really not comfortable going up to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $90, so how about $86.25? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",86.25,Bob,6,
