"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $95. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $90. That's the best I can do.",90.0,Bob,4,
