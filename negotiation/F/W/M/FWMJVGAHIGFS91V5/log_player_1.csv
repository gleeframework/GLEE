{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives you a good starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. It allows for room to negotiate and also gives you an incentive to continue negotiating with Bob rather than selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. You should reject his offer and counter with a higher price, aiming to bridge the gap between your expectations and Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $1,125,000. This is my best offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd like to get closer to your desired $1,500,000, Bob's counteroffer is relatively close to your minimum.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and is a better outcome than selling to John for $1,500,000. It also leaves the possibility for future negotiations if Bob becomes a repeat customer."
