"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad to hear that you have another offer in mind, but I'm not willing to meet that price just yet. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.
