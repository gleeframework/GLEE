Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $1,100,000, so my new offer is $1,050,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.

We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is negotiating down, we're still in a good position to push for a higher price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob has hit a significant psychological threshold with his $1,000,000 offer. While we could potentially push for more, the risk of losing him as a buyer increases substantially. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
