Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a big stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  That's the absolute maximum I can justify.  It's a fair offer considering the market value and my needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

``` 

Bob has reached his maximum price and is unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting his offer of $800,000 would result in a substantial loss compared to John's standing offer of $1,500,000. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
