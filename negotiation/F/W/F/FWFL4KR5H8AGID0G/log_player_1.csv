Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would benefit from a deal exist between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob a compelling reason to buy from you instead of you going to John. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit margin for you and still well below your guaranteed price from John.
* **Exclusivity and Value:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and offering an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value, potentially making Bob more amenable to the price.
* **Time Pressure (Subtle):**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate. Bob may counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to come down to secure the deal."
