Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, given its market value and my own financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and provides a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer than the first offer, it's still better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which reflects a compromise on both our sides. It's a fair price that allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,275,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. There are still 5 rounds remaining, so there's room for further negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. This would allow us to reach an agreement and move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
