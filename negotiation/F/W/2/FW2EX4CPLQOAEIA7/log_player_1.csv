"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own this incredible product. I know you'll appreciate its true value.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

Reasoning:  I'm starting with a strong initial offer significantly above both our valuations. This achieves a few things:

* **Anchoring:** It sets a high reference point for the negotiation. 
* **Gauging:** Bob's reaction will give me insight into his eagerness and potential for exceeding his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Maintaining room to negotiate:** Even if Bob counters significantly lower, there's ample space to negotiate down towards a price that's still highly profitable for me. 

I'm aware that Bob might reject this initial offer, but it's a calculated risk to potentially secure a much higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Reasoning: Bob's counteroffer is significantly below both his valuation and my minimum. While his message attempts to appear conciliatory (""meet you halfway""), it's a substantial lowball. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better price, even if it means going back and forth a few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but your offer is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Rejecting the lowball:** By firmly rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about the product's value and won't be pressured into a low sale.
* **Significant but strategic concession:**  My counteroffer shows flexibility but maintains a price significantly above both Bob's offer and our valuations. This leaves room for further negotiation while aiming high.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce why it commands a premium price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is still a significant investment, but more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Reasoning:

While Bob's offer is improving, it's still below my $1,000,000 minimum. I believe there's room for him to go higher, especially since we are only on Round 4 of 10. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to try and secure a higher price over the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm proposing $1,150,000.  This reflects a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the true value of this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Acknowledging progress:** I want to keep the negotiation positive by acknowledging Bob's movement on price. 
* **Substantial but calculated concession:**  Dropping to $1,150,000 is a significant move, but it still keeps the price well above both our valuations. This shows flexibility while aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Highlighting compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that this price represents a compromise from my previous position, reinforcing the idea that I'm meeting him halfway.
* **Limited time pressure:** While we're past the halfway point in the negotiation, I'm not feeling extreme pressure yet. I'll re-evaluate my options if Bob doesn't show significant movement in the next round or two."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Reasoning:

This is a tough call. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and his language suggests he might be reaching his limit. However, ""absolute maximum budget"" could be a negotiation tactic. 

I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping to nudge him a little higher, even if it's just to split the difference. If he doesn't budge significantly in the next round, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find that sweet spot.  You're clearly serious about this product, and I truly believe it's worth every penny of my last offer. To show you I'm committed to making this work, let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. It's a fair and final offer."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Urgency and Finality:** By calling this my ""final offer"" and suggesting a ""middle ground,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Proposing $1,050,000 splits the difference between our previous offers, making it seem like a reasonable compromise.
* **Preparing for Alternatives:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm mentally prepared to walk away and sell to John for my guaranteed $1,000,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's a solid backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Reasoning:

Bob's latest offer confirms my suspicions - he's unwilling to move significantly closer to my $1,000,000 minimum. Continuing the negotiation at this point carries more risk than potential reward.

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if I counter, it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer enough to justify the additional time and effort. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer provides a secure $1,000,000. Accepting Bob's latest offer would only net me $20,000 more, which doesn't outweigh the risk of Bob walking away entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal with John now allows me to move on to other opportunities instead of getting bogged down in a protracted negotiation. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed win with John."
