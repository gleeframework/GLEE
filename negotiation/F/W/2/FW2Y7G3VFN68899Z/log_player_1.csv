Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $120 is a good distance from your minimum price of $80, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Is attractive to Bob:** The price is still lower than the product's value to him, giving him incentive to accept.
* **Is fair:**  It's not a completely unreasonable price for you, allowing you to potentially earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering it's worth $80 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly below your initial offer. You have the chance to make more money by counteroffering, so rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $95 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your desired price, $92.50 is still below your minimum goal of $80. Since you've already negotiated for a bit, it's worth trying to push for a higher price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite at $92.50. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $94. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to pay $94. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $91 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum desired price, you've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's looking like reaching a mutually acceptable price will be difficult. Since you have a guaranteed sale to John for $80, it's the most reasonable decision to avoid further negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
