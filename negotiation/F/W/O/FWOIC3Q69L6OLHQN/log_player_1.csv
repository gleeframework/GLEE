{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation while ensuring I get a good profit.  I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! While the product looks great, $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $105 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you maybe do $95? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I want to get for this product. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $100? This way, both of us get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
