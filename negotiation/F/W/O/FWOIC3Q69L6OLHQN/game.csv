"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for offering, Alice! While the product looks great, $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $105 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you maybe do $95? That's the highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $100? This way, both of us get a good deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
