"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $150?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. How about $137.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to negotiation, but $137.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $143.75?  I think that's a fair compromise.",143.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $143.75 is still above my budget. How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
