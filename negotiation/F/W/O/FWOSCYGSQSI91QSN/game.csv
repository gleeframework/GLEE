"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $8000 for this product.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my minimum. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
