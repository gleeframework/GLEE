"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $900,000.  This is a significant investment on my part and a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're both invested in finding a solution.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000. However, I value our negotiation and believe this product can be transformative for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal go through.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. That other offer does not impact my valuation. I can tell this product means a lot to you and that you are making compromises.  To meet you halfway, I can offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
