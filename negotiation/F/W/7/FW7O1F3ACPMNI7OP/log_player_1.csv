"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you aim to set a high anchor point. This might shift his perception of the product's value upwards. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides ample space for negotiation over the next 10 rounds. It allows you to gradually decrease the price while gauging Bob's reactions and counteroffers. 
* **Confident Tone:** Using language like ""unique potential"" and ""significant benefits"" aims to reinforce the product's value in Bob's mind, even with the high initial price.

This strategy seeks to maximize your potential profit while staying aware of Bob's valuation and the alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for you. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for such a low price. You have room to negotiate and John's offer serves as a strong backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  You're lowering your price by $300,000, signaling flexibility but still staying well above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** You're continuing to emphasize the product's value proposition to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's reaction and determine his negotiation range. His response will guide your strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $900,000.  This is a significant investment on my part and a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer increased by only $100,000, indicating he might be negotiating slowly and cautiously.
* **Below Your Minimum:**  $900,000 is still significantly below your $1,500,000 threshold. 
* **Time for a Stronger Stance:**  You've made two significant price reductions. It's time to hold firmer and see if Bob is willing to move closer to your range. You have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're both invested in finding a solution.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000. However, I value our negotiation and believe this product can be transformative for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal go through."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealing John's Offer (Partially):** By revealing you have another offer at a specific price, you establish a credible bottom line without completely showing your hand. This adds pressure on Bob to make a more serious offer.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** Emphasizing your significant price reduction and desire to close the deal positions you as flexible and solution-oriented, potentially encouraging Bob to reciprocate.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the price significantly above Bob's offer, but the smaller reduction (compared to previous rounds) signals that you're approaching your limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. That other offer does not impact my valuation. I can tell this product means a lot to you and that you are making compromises.  To meet you halfway, I can offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,000,000 is his final offer, and he has not been swayed by your mention of John's offer. This strongly suggests he is unwilling to go higher.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away. Even if you could negotiate him up slightly, the potential gains are minimal compared to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures you achieve your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 without further negotiation or uncertainty. 

While you could try to negotiate further with Bob, the potential upside is likely not worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer."
