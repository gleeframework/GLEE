"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  We're offering a price that's closer to Alice's estimated value of $800,000. This shows that we are serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably from her original price. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she'll reject your counteroffer, forcing you to pay John's higher price. At $875,000, you're getting a good deal and saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
