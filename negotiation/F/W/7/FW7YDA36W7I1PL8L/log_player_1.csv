Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $10,000, you can gauge Bob's interest. If he readily accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you have the option to come down while still staying above your $8,000 minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer at $8,000, ensuring you won't be forced to sell below your minimum."
