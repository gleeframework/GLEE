"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, as it leaves room for us both to potentially benefit. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into setting a fair price. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking to receive while staying within my financial limits.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet halfway and settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $1,075,000? This would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limits.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
