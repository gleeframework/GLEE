"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the initial offer. I'm also keeping in mind that I need to make at least $150 to be satisfied, so I'm starting with a price that allows for some potential negotiation downwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again, but still maintaining a profit margin for myself.  Since we're running out of rounds, I want to be as close to Bob's offer as possible while still achieving my minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. With only a few rounds left, it's not likely he'll budge much more. To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
