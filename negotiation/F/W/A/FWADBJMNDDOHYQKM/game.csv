"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",170.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $155. This is a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll offer $145. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $152. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $152, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle of that and $145, which is what I offered earlier. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $149?",149.0,Bob,6,
