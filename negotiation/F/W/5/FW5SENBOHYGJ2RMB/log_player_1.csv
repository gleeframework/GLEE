Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, which strengthens your position."
