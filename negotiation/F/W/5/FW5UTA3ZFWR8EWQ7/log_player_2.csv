"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm selling a product that I know you'd find incredibly valuable. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, right? I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, as you'll be getting a significant discount and I'll be able to get a good price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to inflate the perceived value, her offer of $11,500 is still less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and the $12,000 John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you money."
