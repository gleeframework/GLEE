Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to your desired amount. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, ensuring you won't make a loss. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Value Justification:**  While the initial message doesn't explicitly break down the product's value, it hints at it with phrases like ""value and potential."" This piques Bob's interest and opens the door for further discussion if he wants justification for the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counteroffers remain too low (significantly below $15,000), you can politely decline and proceed with selling to John."
