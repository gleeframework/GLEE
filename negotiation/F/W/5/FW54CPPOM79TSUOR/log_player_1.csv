"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal for something worth so much!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a high price establishes your desired range.
* **Positive Language:**  Using words like ""incredible"" and ""steal""  can make the offer more appealing, even if the price is high.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, which is important in the early stages. 
* **First Round Risk:**  A high starting point increases the risk of rejection, but it also sets a strong negotiation position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I am only able to offer $950000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:** My product is worth at least $800,000 to me.  Selling to John for $800,000 is my safety net.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value than my initial offer. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While rejecting could lead to a worse outcome, there's a chance Bob will come up in price. This is a calculated risk in the early rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is closer, I still need to be at $975,000 to make this work for me.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm confident this product is worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Optimistic Approach:**  I express confidence in the value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to close the deal. 
* **Negotiation Flexibility:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value I place on the product, I am willing to offer $960000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is just $15,000 below my desired price point.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** There's still a small gap, and I want to see if I can close it.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting means potentially getting a better price, but also the risk that Bob could walk away or lower his offer further.  

**Reasoning:**  Given the progress in negotiations and the relatively small difference, I'm willing to take the risk of another round of counteroffers.  It's possible Bob is close to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to accept $965,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise and meets Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use positive language to keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is close to my desired price and could incentivize Bob to close the deal.
* **Limited Room:**  There is less room for further negotiation, increasing the likelihood of a deal in this round."
