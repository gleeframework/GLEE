Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low for me, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
