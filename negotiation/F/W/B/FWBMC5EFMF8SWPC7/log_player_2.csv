# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $12,000. There's room for a deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay above my minimum price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

You're still closer to John's price, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice. There's still room to lower the price to a more acceptable level."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a little out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  How about $10,875? This would be a fair compromise and allows me to still earn a decent amount for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $10,875 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. It's better to stick to your initial goal and buy from John for $10,000 to save money."
