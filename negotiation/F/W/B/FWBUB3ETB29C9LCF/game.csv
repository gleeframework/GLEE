"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can we consider this a fair price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable, and this price reflects that.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",92.0,Bob,6,
