"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $130 to $120, which is a good price for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge again, and he'd end up paying $150 to John.  Accepting the offer at $120 is the best option for Bob to save money."
