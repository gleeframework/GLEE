"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you will be even greater.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000, a figure I believe is fair considering its potential for you. Let's talk.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I respect that. However, $600000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price reflects the value of the product and provides us both with a good outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll go down to $800000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  If you're serious about this deal, I urge you to consider this offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $800000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",650000.0,Bob,6,
