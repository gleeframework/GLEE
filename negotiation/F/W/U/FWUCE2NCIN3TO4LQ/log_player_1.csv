Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, as I believe Bob values it the same. This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I'm confident that even if Bob doesn't accept initially, I can still reach a good price through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than my minimum, it's still below what I know the product is worth to Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is a compromise, offering Bob a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than his counteroffer. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering both our valuations and the potential of going back and forth further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll get more. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and clean deal at my desired price point."
