Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures that I don't immediately lose out on potential profits. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, my goal is to maximize my profit. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob and see if I can get a better offer from him or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but closer to his offer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come up a bit more, as it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a fair price for the product."
