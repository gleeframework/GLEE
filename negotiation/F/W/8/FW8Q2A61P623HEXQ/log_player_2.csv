"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, Bob can still get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his target price of $10,000 as possible. He's offering $10,500, which is still a decent discount for Alice, while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down slightly to $11,000, but Bob has already established that he can get the product from John for $10,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as the potential savings are not significant enough to justify the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer."
