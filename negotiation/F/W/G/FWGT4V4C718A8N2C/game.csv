"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested but only within my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a better price than my initial offer, but still reflects the value the product holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we settle somewhere around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
