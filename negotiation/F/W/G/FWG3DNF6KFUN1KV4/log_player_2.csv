"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and developed over years of research and innovation. This product is not just an item; it's a solution that can significantly enhance your operations or personal needs. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than its face value. Considering all these factors, I would like to extend an exclusive offer to you for $1200000. I am confident that this investment will pay off in numerous ways for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no incentive to negotiate further as you can get the product for the same price from John. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but there's no guarantee, and it could take time and effort. It's more efficient to buy from John and avoid the uncertainty."
