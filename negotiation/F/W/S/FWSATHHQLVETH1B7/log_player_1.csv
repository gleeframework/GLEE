Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also leaving room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  If he rejects this, I'll consider his counteroffer and then decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is better than selling to John, but I think I can do better.  I'll counteroffer with something closer to my original price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,000. It's a bit closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my original asking price. I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $13,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good deal, especially considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and possibly ending up with John's offer of $10,000."
