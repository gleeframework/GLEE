# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still within the range where I can likely negotiate further.  I want to see if I can get Alice to drop the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}

# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
