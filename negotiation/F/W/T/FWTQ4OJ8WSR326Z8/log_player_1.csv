Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Backup Option:** We know John will buy the product for $10,000, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob declines."
