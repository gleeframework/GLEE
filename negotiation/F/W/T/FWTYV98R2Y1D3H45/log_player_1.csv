Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance Bob will pay more than my minimum ($150).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $140 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation if he's very interested.
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing money. I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150."
