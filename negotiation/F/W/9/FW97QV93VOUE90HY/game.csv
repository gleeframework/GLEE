"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my range.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking of a price closer to my original offer. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a bit stretched at $11,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it puts us both closer to our target.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $11,200? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession to make this work.",11200.0,Alice,5,
