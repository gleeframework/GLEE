"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering your asking price and my needs. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my side, and I believe it's a fair price given our previous discussions. Let's make a deal!",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,200,000, which is my minimum price. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and it allows us to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
