"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, you can potentially get it for cheaper. You know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $10,000, but I'm not quite comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is very close to my limit of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer or the deal falling through altogether is high.  It's better to accept her offer and secure the product for a price that's only slightly above my budget."
