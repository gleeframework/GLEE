"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraint, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $9500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
