"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $750000 is significantly lower than the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $825000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $825000. How about $787500?",787500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $787500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $800000. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll be selling to John. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
