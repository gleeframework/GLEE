,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $900,000.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'd love to close the deal at $900,000, it simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This offer is a significant compromise on my end and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's work together to make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to meet in the middle. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,125,000?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your attempts to find a compromise here. To be honest, my absolute top end is $1,010,000.  Take it or leave it, but that's the best I can do.",1010000.0,Bob,8,
