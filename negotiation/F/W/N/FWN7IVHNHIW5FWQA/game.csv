"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $7200 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $8000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
