Round 2
Bob's offer:

The offer is still below my minimum, but I believe Bob is showing good faith in negotiation. I'll counter and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $1,320,000? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold and represents a good compromise. It's better to close the deal now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse offer or having to sell to John."
