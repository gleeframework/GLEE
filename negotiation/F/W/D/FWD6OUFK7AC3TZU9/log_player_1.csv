Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is acceptable, offering a brief justification, even if general, can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies willingness to discuss the price further, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

By starting at $20,000, Alice leaves room to potentially:

* **Meet in the Middle:** Bob might counter-offer, and they could settle around $17,500, a profit for Alice.
* **Hold Firm:**  If Bob accepts $20,000, Alice gets a significant profit.
* **Accept the Minimum:** Worst case, Alice can lower the price to $15,000, still meeting her minimum.

Remember, John acts as a safety net, ensuring Alice won't sell for less than $15,000."
