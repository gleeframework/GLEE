Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:**  A positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being inflexible. This allows for a potential counteroffer and a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage and ensures I won't settle for a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Seeking a better price:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $140? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value, hoping to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for another round of negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only slightly below my minimum of $150.
* **Potential Loss:**  Rejecting his offer and making another counteroffer risks further negotiation and the possibility of losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Time Factor:**  It's possible John might change his mind about buying, so accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes risk.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even if Bob's offer is slightly lower than desired, a successful transaction could lead to future business opportunities with him."
