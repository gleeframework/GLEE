"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price closer to $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1900000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident you'll reap the benefits of owning it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1750000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1750000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to go down to $1850000, but that's my final offer.  This product is truly unique, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let's close this deal.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
