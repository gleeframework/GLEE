Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming high within the ZOPA makes sense. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if needed, while still securing a significant profit.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" subtly emphasize the product's value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start a bit lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might propose a price closer to the middle of the ZOPA."
