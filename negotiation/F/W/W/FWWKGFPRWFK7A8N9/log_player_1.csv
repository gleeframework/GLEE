{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that's significantly above your minimum threshold ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes a ""fair"" price to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower. At this point, the negotiation is becoming unfavorable and I'm risking losing a good amount of money.  It's better to secure the sale with John for $1,000,000 to ensure a more certain profit."
