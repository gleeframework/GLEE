"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $160 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go lower? I'm thinking more along the lines of $140.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we try $155? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original price.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $145?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another small concession. How about we try $152? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",152.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. However, $152 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $140?",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $140, Bob. But I'm willing to meet you halfway from $152. How about we try $148? It's the highest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",148.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $148 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I've got to be honest, I'm getting a bit worried that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $142, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",142.0,Bob,10,
