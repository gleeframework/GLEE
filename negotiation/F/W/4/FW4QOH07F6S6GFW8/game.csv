"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal closer to $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is as low as I can go without losing too much profit.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
