"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. $14,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  Could you do $13,000? I think that's a fair price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I think this is a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,5,
