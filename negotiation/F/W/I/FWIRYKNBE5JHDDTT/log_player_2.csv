```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $135, which is still below my maximum price of $150.
* It's a good compromise, as it's closer to my target price of $120. 
* Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk is that Alice might reject my offer and I'll end up buying from John for $150. 
* Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
