"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a concession to get it into your hands. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal (saving $200,000), there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, and I do see the value in this product. However,  $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and at $750,000, the deal is still a good value for Bob, saving him $250,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and the possibility of needing to buy from John at a higher price outweigh the potential for a slight further price reduction."
