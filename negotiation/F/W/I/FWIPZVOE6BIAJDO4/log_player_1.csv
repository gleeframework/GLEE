"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product. I believe it will be incredibly beneficial to you. Given its immense value, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer that's slightly below Bob's perceived value. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter and feel like he's getting a deal, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **Polite and Professional:** The tone is important.  Being respectful and acknowledging the product's value to Bob helps foster a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a deal that's more in line with the product's actual value. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it, given its potential benefits to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our target and his perceived value. We have room to negotiate and can likely reach a better agreement.  We're willing to counter-offer and continue the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and what it can achieve for your business.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,050,000.  This offer reflects the product's immense value while still providing you with a significant return on investment. "",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm but Fair:**  We're moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still anchoring the price above a million.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value proposition to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price.
* **Finding a Compromise:** This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a fair price, considering the potential benefits to my business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong price and meets our goals for this negotiation. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the final price or reaching an impasse."
