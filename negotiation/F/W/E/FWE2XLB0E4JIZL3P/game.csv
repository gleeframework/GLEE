"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start closer to market value? I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're continuing to discuss the price, Bob. However, $925,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. Let's try $975,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",975000.0,Alice,5,
