"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $9,500 for the product. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit stretched at $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm ready to make a deal at that price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, so I'll do $9,750. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",9750.0,Alice,5,
