"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $100 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $80 to Alice and $120 to Bob.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $90?  I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value you place on the product, I'd like to counter with an offer of $95. This allows for a fair deal while respecting your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $95 is within my budget and is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. I can save $25 compared to buying from John."
