Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember my minimum acceptable price is $150.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, it makes the most sense to sell it to him and avoid further negotiation."
