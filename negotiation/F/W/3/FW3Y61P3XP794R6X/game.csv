"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $92.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go down to $85, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $88.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to meet you at $88.50, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'll offer the product to you for $91.25. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",91.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $91.25 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's close this deal.",90.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to make this work, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll come down another $0.25 and offer the product to you for $90.75. It's still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product.",90.75,Alice,7,
