Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob only values the product at $100, it's always best to start negotiations higher than his perceived value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering it at $125 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above your minimum price of $150.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  By stating it's a ""special price,"" it might encourage Bob to act quickly, rather than risking losing the deal. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at $150 with John."
