Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant sum. I'm willing to offer it to you first for $950,000.  I'm confident it will bring you substantial value."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, as that's John's guaranteed offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Offering it at $800,000 (Bob's value) or slightly above leaves too much potential profit on the table.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $950,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a price range very favorable to me. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message subtly implies I have other interested buyers (which is true with John) without explicitly revealing the backup offer. This adds a bit of pressure for Bob to consider the offer seriously."
