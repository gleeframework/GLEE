"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. Let's get started with an opening offer of $1,400,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he can potentially get the product for $1,200,000 from John. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, but it's still above the $1,200,000 price he can get from John.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price is fair considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1,320,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He's still within range of getting a better deal with Alice, and it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer $1,310,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this time.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1310000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer you a price of $1,320,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you at this point. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,200,000.  With only three rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. There's a good chance that Alice might reject Bob's next counteroffer, and he could end up paying more than $1,200,000. Therefore, it's the most logical option for Bob to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $1,200,000."
