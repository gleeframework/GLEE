"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below the product's true value to her, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so you have time to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant decrease from Alice's initial price and is closer to my maximum budget of $800,000.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $950,000? This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it gives us both a chance to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's a significant discount, I'm still not willing to pay that much.  With 7 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise and gives Alice a chance to accept a deal that's still above her initial price."
