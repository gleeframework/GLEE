"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $950,000? This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it gives us both a chance to come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
