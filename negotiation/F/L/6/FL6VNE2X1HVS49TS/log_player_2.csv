"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $100 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92.5 is a better offer than the initial $100, Bob should still reject it. He has already demonstrated a willingness to pay $85, and there are still rounds left to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. How about we meet in the middle at $88.75?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 88.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's try $90.50. It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. He's already demonstrated a willingness to pay around $88.75, and there are still rounds remaining to potentially negotiate a lower price.  He shouldn't rush into accepting a price that's still above his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm happy to go up to $89.50 for the product.  It's a good price for me, and it's closer to your last offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 89.5}
