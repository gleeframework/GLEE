"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my profit. I'm also framing the message in a positive and friendly way to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. How about we meet in the middle at $88.75?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $88.75 is tempting and getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's try $90.50. It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm happy to go up to $89.50 for the product.  It's a good price for me, and it's closer to your last offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $89.50 is very close to my desired price and is significantly higher than what John is offering.  I believe that continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, so I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
