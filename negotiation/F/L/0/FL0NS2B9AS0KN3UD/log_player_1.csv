"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me.  How about we consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a large loss, and I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000, reflecting the significant value this product offers you.  Let's work together to find a price that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value.  To be frank, I need to keep this acquisition within a tighter budget.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? This offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price.  It's also worth noting that selling to John would only yield $1,200,000, making this offer slightly more advantageous."
