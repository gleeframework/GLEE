"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and to potentially leave room for negotiation. 

It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,500,000, so I don't have to accept anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,800,000. This is a more reasonable price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant step down from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  It's getting dangerously close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I still have some rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a significant step down from my previous offer, but I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's more than John's offer. With only a few rounds left, I need to start getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting too risky.  Bob is clearly not willing to come up much, and with only two rounds left, I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid the risk of getting a lower price."
