"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can agree on a price that's a bit more manageable for me. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to say that $700,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,3,
