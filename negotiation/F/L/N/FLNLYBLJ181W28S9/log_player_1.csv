Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $190. I think you'll find it's worth the price, but let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 190
}
``` 

My reasoning:

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $190 offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to $170-$180.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but makes it clear that I believe the product is valuable. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
