"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's perceived value of $800,000 and meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but still leaves some room for further negotiation.  I believe this is a fair price considering both of our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him to a better price in the next round. While $920,000 is close to my minimum value, I'm hoping to get closer to my preferred price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm going to stick with my strategy of slowly closing the gap.  $940,000 is a reasonable compromise and shows I'm willing to be flexible.  I believe this price reflects both of our positions fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $915,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little further. We're getting close to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}
```

I'm going to counter with $930,000.  This is another small step towards meeting Bob's price, but I still believe it's a fair price considering my minimum value.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, so I'm hoping this offer will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 2 rounds left, and Bob's offers getting closer to my minimum value, I'm feeling the pressure. However, I'm confident I can still get a better price with John.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,200,000, and it's worth the risk to avoid settling for less."
