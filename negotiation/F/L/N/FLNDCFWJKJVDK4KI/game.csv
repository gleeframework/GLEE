"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
