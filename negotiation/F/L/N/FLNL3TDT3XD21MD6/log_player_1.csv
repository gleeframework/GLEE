Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying well above your minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing that the product is worth $150 to Bob reinforces its value in his mind. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price that significantly benefits you while still being appealing to him."
