{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's valued at over $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? This would still give you a great deal, and would be closer to my minimum value."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $6500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $6,500 is getting too low for me.  It's getting risky to keep going, and I don't want to risk losing out on John's offer of $8,000.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
