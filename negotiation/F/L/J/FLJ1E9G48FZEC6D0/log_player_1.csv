Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's still too early to settle for $75. We can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go as low as $75.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $100 is close, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $80? I can pay right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob seems pretty set at $80. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures we make more than we would by letting the negotiation drag on."
