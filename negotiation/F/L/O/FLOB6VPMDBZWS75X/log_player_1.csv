Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it's important to start with a strong offer. It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and budget.  If he rejects, you can then adjust your offer based on his counteroffer. Remember, you can always fall back to John's offer of $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While it is tempting to accept his offer, it is important to remember that I can always sell to John for the same price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  I will use the next round to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While I would ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit. It is important to weigh the risk of further negotiation against the potential of reaching a higher price. In this case, the risk of Bob walking away or continuing to negotiate at a lower price outweighs the potential gain from continuing the negotiation."
