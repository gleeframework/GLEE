"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see its worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, his ""final offer"" is still significantly below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
