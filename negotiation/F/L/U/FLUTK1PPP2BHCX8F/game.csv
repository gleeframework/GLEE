"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $100 for it, as that's the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate you being interested in the product, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.  Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $120.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it's the most I'm willing to spend.  Let's see if we can make this work.",120.0,Bob,4,
