Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but not outrageously so.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive and Open:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Knowing My Floor:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $150, so I won't go lower than that. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter.
* I'll always keep John's offer in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $100 for it, as that's the value I see in it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $100 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I know I can always sell to John for $150, so there's no pressure to accept Bob's low offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, hopefully finding a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate you being interested in the product, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Reasonable Price:** $135 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product will bring to Bob, which could incentivize him to pay more. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message still signals openness to negotiation, but it's clear that I'm not willing to go much lower than $135. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer, or counter again, always keeping John's offer in mind as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $120.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it's the most I'm willing to spend.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below it.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Although I could counteroffer again, there's a risk that we'll get stuck in a protracted negotiation.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $150 is a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't lose money.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's a better outcome than selling to Bob at a price below my minimum."
