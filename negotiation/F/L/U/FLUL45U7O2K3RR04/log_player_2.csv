"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to me, but I understand its true worth to you might be even greater. I am offering it to you for $12000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between respecting its value and making it accessible to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. If I buy from her, I'll be paying $12,000, but I can get it for $15,000 from John. I'd rather save the extra $3,000.
