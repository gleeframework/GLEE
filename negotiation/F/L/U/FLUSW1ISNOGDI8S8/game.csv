"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its worth to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also open to selling to another buyer who's willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I believe it's worth to me. How about $950,000? I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,075,000 is a bit high. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose $1,050,000. I hope this offers a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
