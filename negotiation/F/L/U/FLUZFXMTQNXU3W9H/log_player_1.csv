"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm open to negotiating a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price, but I'm being friendly and leaving room for negotiation.  This is a good starting point to see how Bob reacts and if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between these prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still only able to offer $120 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford, and I hope it aligns with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is sticking to his $120 offer, which is lower than my minimum price of $150.  It's clear we won't be able to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's best to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
