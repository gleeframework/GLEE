Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for $1,200,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Sense of exclusivity and urgency:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer""  might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value, mentioning its worth subtly implies a reason for the high price.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer."
