"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're getting started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. I hope this revised offer is more acceptable to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you have another offer on the table, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,025,000.  It's better to secure the known deal with John at $1,000,000 than risk further negotiation with Alice for a relatively small potential savings."
