Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.
