Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me some room for negotiation.
* **Showing flexibility:** My message emphasizes that this is a good deal for Bob, implying I might be willing to adjust the price slightly.
* **The backup option:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $12,000, so I'm not pressured to sell to Bob at a significantly lower price.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your confidence in the product's value,  $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** Even though I'm not eager to go lower, I still see potential for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to pay more than his initial assessment. 
* **Leverage with John:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to push for a better price from Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is halfway between my last offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). It shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining value:** $10,250 is still significantly above Bob's initial assessment of $10,000.
* **Clear communication:** The message reiterates the value proposition for Bob and keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Backup plan:**  I'm confident in my ability to sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept Bob's initial offer."
