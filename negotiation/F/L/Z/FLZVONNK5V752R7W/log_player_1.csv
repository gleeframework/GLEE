Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($120),** giving you a chance to make a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum price ($150),** leaving room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encourages a response.** 

By starting with a slightly lower price, you encourage Bob to consider the offer while still leaving room for negotiation if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great deal considering what this product can do for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my minimum price.** This leaves room for a potential agreement. 
* **Message is friendly and highlights the value of the product.** This helps keep the negotiation positive.
* **Remains firm on a higher price.** This shows I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $137.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $137.50 is still below my minimum price of $150. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already had a few rounds and it's clear that Bob is not willing to pay close to my desired price.  John is offering me my minimum price, so it's best to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
