"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a better price than $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price. He knows Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer is a starting point for further negotiation. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, but it establishes Bob's desire to get a significantly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer, and still higher than Bob's desired price.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob another chance to make a counteroffer and push for a lower price.  It's still better than buying from John at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer ($1,250,000) but still significantly lower than her initial offer.  This shows Bob is willing to negotiate but still wants a price closer to his target of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate further. It's likely Alice is willing to go lower than $1,300,000. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's last offer, showing flexibility.  This counteroffer is a compromise, suggesting Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway.  It's still significantly lower than her initial price, giving her some room to negotiate while still being a good deal for Bob compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good price for Bob. While he might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up with John's higher price ($1,500,000) outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price while avoiding any further risk."
