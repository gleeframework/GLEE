"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
