Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still higher than Alice's minimum.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better price. He still has room to counteroffer and potentially get closer to his goal of $8,500."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Buying from John is now the better option as it avoids further negotiation and ensures he gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
