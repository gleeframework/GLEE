Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price ($1,200,000).** While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal. 
* **I have 10 rounds and can still counter-offer.**  There's time to work with Bob and potentially increase his offer.
* **Selling to John is not ideal.** It would be a significant loss compared to what I believe the product is worth. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and signal my willingness to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's aim for a quick agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1280000. I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'd like to get a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price ($1,200,000).** While it's very close, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum.
* **Selling to John is still not ideal, but it's becoming more tempting.**  I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I may not have enough time to get Bob to my desired price. 
* **I'm still hopeful I can get Bob to budge.**  I'll need to make a counteroffer that is more attractive, but not too low.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have a chance to secure a better deal. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a little above $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,290,000. This is a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1290000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.** I need to find a middle ground that allows me to secure a reasonable profit.
* **I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.**  I need to start closing the gap and make a more tempting offer.
* **John's offer is becoming increasingly appealing.** If this round doesn't result in a successful deal, I might be forced to take John's offer.

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise further while still maintaining a profitable sale. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer to avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1290000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1275000. I'm getting close to my target price, and I'd like to see if we can meet there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price ($1,200,000).** Even though we are nearing the end of the negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum.
* **We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds.** With only four rounds remaining, there is a high chance that we won't be able to reach an agreement with Bob, and I will lose more time.
* **John's offer is now the most profitable option.**  It guarantees a sale and secures a price that is closer to my desired price than what Bob is offering.

Selling to John is now the best course of action to ensure a successful sale and a reasonable profit.  It's a difficult decision, but with limited time left, I need to prioritize a guaranteed sale over further negotiation with Bob."
