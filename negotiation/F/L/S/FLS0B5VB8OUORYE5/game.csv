"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand we both value this product, and I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while reflecting the product's true value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would allow us both to make a fair deal while still respecting the value of the product. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
