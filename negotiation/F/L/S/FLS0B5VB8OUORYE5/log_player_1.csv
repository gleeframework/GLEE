Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
