"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but I'm confident the product's value to Bob justifies it.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $900,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a reasonable amount considering the product's value to Bob. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's inching closer to my minimum, I'm going to keep pushing for a better price. I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in finalizing the transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit too low, but we are getting very close. I am going to reject his offer and make another counter offer, hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product. We're almost there, and I want to finalize the deal before we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm worried I won't be able to get a price I'm happy with.  I'd rather secure the $1,000,000 from John than risk a lower price with Bob."
