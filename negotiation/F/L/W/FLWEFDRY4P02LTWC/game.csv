"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to the right buyer. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential for substantial returns. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, reflecting the potential value this product holds for you. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
