"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to your business.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price gives you a significant advantage and allows me a strong return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
