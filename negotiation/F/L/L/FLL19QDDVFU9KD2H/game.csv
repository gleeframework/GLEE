,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your new one? Would $102.50 work for you?",102.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $102.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $115? It's a fair compromise and closer to what I'm aiming for.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying my best to make this work, but I have a hard limit.  Would you be willing to do it for $105?",105.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference at $110? I think that's fair for both of us.",110.0,Alice,7,
