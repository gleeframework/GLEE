"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price still gives you a significant value for the product, while also being fair to me.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  How about $950,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a fantastic deal. Let's make this happen, I believe this is a good compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy we're narrowing the gap. I'm going to have to stick to my budget, though.  Let's compromise and settle on $925,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,6,
