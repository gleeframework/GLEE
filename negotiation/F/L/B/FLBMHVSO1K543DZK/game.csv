"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's keep the negotiations going.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's find a way to reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value to me. I'm confident we can find common ground and reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
