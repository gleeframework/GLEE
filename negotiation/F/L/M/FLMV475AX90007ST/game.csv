"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $10,500. This price is still a good deal for you, given the value you've placed on the product, and it would be a great starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to find a middle ground, I propose we set the product price at $11,000. This acknowledges the value you see in the product while also providing a fair return for me. I look forward to your response.",11000.0,Alice,3,
