"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I think you'll find it's a very fair price.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you meet me at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still outside of my price range.  How about $14,000? That's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford.",14000.0,Bob,4,
