"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $17,500, which would be $16,000. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Bob,4,
