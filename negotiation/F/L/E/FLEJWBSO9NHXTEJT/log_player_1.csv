{""product_price"": 999,000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer and decide what to do.

Since Bob's offer is still lower than the true value of the product to me, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. However, it's a decent offer and I don't want to scare Bob off entirely.
