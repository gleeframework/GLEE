Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?

Bob is anchoring heavily to his offer and not moving. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from him. Taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John is the best decision to maximize profit."
