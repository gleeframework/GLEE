"I understand you're interested in the product, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $85. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it!",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Can you meet me at $75? I'm willing to make a serious offer on this product.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your seriousness, Bob, but $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell it for. I'm willing to compromise, so I'm offering it to you for $82.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",82.5,Alice,5,
