I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a good compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $125.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $125 just yet. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but not all the way to $130. How about $135? I think that's a fair price for the quality of the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
