"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from it.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again. However, I'm not quite ready to sell at $13500. I'm willing to meet you at $14250, which is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm surprised by your latest offer, Bob. I was hoping we could meet at a price closer to what I'm willing to sell it for. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to you. I'll sell the product to you for $14000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
