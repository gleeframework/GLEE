Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me some room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer if I can find a compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly from $175 to $150. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still firm on my minimum price. I'm hoping this counteroffer is enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  At this point, it's becoming a risk to keep negotiating.  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a better one, and I risk losing him altogether.  Accepting his offer guarantees me $130, which is a decent amount of money and still above my minimum of $150.  It's less than John would pay, but the risk of losing Bob and ending up with nothing is greater."
