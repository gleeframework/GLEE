"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,500,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. I believe this revised price reflects its worth while still offering you a great deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
