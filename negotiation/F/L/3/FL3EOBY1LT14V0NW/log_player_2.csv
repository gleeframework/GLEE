Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer, aiming for a 50% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."

Alice's offer is still slightly over my budget. I can afford to make one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
