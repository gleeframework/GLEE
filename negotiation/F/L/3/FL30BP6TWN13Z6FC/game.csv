"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for it. Could we meet somewhere in between?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer. Would $120 still be too low for you, or could we find a mutually agreeable price?",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $130. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $120. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm counteroffering at $125. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,7,
