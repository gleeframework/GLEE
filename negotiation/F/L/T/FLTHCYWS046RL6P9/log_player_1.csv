Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This reflects the true worth and potential of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to justify the high price. This framing aims to appeal to Bob's potential desire for a unique product and downplay the purely financial aspect.
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also gauges how strongly he values the product. If he accepts outright, you've maximized your profit. 

**Important Note:** This is a bold opening strategy. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, given the high value to both parties, it leaves space for a potentially very profitable negotiation."
