Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**The Strategy**

Since Bob won't pay above his perceived value, a direct negotiation is unlikely to work. You need to either:

1. **Convince Bob the product is worth more:**  This is difficult with the information given.
2. **Accept a price below your minimum:** This only makes sense if you gain something else.

**The Offer**

Given the constraints, it's best to leverage your guaranteed sale to John:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I finalize a deal with another buyer.  While my asking price is typically above your stated valuation, I'm willing to consider a discounted price of $1,450,000 for a quick and decisive sale."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity and Urgency:** Creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act fast.
* **""Typically above your valuation"":** Acknowledges Bob's perspective without devaluing the product.
* **""Discounted price"":** Frames the offer as favorable.
* **$1,450,000:**  While below your guarantee, it's a significant profit if Bob accepts. 

**Important Notes:**

* **This strategy is a gamble.**  Bob might call your bluff or simply decline.
* **Be prepared to walk away.**  If Bob doesn't bite, sell to John as planned.
* **Real-world negotiations involve more factors.** Consider relationships, reputation, and potential future deals."
