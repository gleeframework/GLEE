Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above Bob's budget. While there's a possibility that further negotiation could bring the price down, Bob is running out of rounds.  To guarantee a purchase within his budget and avoid the risk of a deal falling through, it's best to buy the product from John for $8,000."
