Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $100, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $90 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, while still securing a good profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John ($80), so you're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
