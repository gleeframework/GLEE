"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives us both some room to move.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $75? That's a fair jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're on a budget, but $75 is still quite far from what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a reasonable compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I need to stick to my budget. How about we settle at $80? That's a fair price, and it saves us both from further negotiation.",80.0,Bob,6,
