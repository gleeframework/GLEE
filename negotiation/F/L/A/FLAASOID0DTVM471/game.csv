"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
