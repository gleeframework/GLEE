I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value. This allows for some room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm making another slight concession, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob.  This price is closer to his offer, but still gives me a decent profit."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's not guaranteed that Bob will be willing to increase his offer further, and it's risky to continue with the negotiation. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring that I get my desired value."
