{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find great value in the product. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm also willing to negotiate. I believe this price is attractive enough to Bob while still allowing for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's initial offer, I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower offer than my original proposal. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, but still aim for a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm hoping for $1,150,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I would like to propose $1,125,000 as my counteroffer. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate might get me a slightly better price, but the risk of Bob walking away or me losing time is too high.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and brings me closer to my target."
