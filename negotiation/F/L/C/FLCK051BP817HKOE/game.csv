"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm hoping for $1,150,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
