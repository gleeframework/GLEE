"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $82? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we try $79? It's still a compromise, but I think it's closer to my original price point.",79.0,Alice,5,
