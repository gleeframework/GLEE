"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's start our negotiations here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep talking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price of $950,000 or higher.  Rejecting this offer allows me to keep negotiating and potentially get a better price. I also have the safety net of selling to John for $800,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident that this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
