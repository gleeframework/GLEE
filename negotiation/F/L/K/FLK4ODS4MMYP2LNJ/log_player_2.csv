"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's start our negotiations here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep talking."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident that this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and higher than Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a potential for a deal.  While Bob might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of further negotiation leading to a breakdown or a higher price from John outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
