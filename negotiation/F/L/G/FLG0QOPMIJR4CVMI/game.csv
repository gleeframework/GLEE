"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm a bit of a bargain hunter, so I was hoping we could meet in the middle.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is way too low for the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the product is worth more than $60, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $90 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
