Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm a bit of a bargain hunter, so I was hoping we could meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is way too low for the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"",
""product_price"": 140

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you think the product is worth more than $60, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $90 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price far below the product's value to me.  He's unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to continue haggling with Bob."
