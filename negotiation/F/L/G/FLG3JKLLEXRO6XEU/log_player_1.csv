I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $135? I'm confident you'll still get a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum price and it's a good compromise. I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
