"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, so even at $1,200,000 you are getting a good deal.** You are paying less than what the product is worth to you."
