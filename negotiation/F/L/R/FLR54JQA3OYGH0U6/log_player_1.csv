Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you value highly. Given its unique benefits, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd theoretically pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($1,350,000) maximizes your potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150,000). This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob instead of resorting to John's lower offer. 

The message is framed as a mutually beneficial proposition, emphasizing value and inviting Bob's perspective."
