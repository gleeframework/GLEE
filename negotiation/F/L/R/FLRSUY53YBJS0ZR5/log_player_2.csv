"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant saving compared to the market value of $12,000. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, it's still higher than what John is offering.  You can use John's offer as leverage to try and get a better price from Alice."
