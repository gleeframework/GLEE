This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's more likely Bob will counteroffer, giving me a chance to refine my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low.  My product is worth more than that, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $7,500? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow me to purchase today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
