"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. I should try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still aiming for a price well below John's $8,000 backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low.  My product is worth more than that, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still higher than John's price. It's worth making one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $7,500? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow me to purchase today."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer and my ideal price. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, though.  How about $8,000?  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met my bottom line. There's no point in rejecting her offer to try and get a lower price, as it's the same as John's."
