"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's compromise and find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to stay above $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
