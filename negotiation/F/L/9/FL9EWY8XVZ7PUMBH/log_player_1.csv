{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving the product away for less than what it's worth to you. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation. 
* **It's a fair opening offer:** It doesn't seem overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal if he accepts. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than the price you'd prefer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more for my product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
