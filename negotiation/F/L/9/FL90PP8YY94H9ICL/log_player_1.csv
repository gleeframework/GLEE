Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $750,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I'll consider it. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'm not too keen on accepting his offer. However, I don't want to lose the deal entirely, so I'll make a counteroffer.

I'll send a counteroffer of $725,000, which is slightly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.
