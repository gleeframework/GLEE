"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
