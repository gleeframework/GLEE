"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth a higher investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  Perhaps we could agree on $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, but I need to be upfront.  $11,500 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but if we can't find agreement soon, I'll need to explore other options for selling this product. My final offer is $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, and I respect that.  However, I also have a budget I need to stick to.  $12,000 is the absolute most I can offer for the product. If you're unable to accept that, I understand, but I'm ready to finalize a deal one way or another.",12000.0,Bob,6,
