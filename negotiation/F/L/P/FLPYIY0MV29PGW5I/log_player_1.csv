**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge beyond $1,075,000. This is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer.  Continuing negotiations with him is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
