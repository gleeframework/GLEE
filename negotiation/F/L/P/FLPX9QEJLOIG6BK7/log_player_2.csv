# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can use the information about John's offer as leverage to push for a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value I place on the product and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget.  You can likely negotiate a lower price. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can reach a price closer to your $800,000 limit. Remember, you always have the option to buy from John if you can't get a better deal with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $990000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  While it's closer to your desired price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is offering the product at your maximum budget, and it's a safer option to avoid the uncertainty of more rounds of negotiation with Alice."
