"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850000. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the potential benefits I see in this product. I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I need a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value I place on the product and the benefits it will bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1100000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $950000. This is a fair compromise that respects both of our needs and brings us closer to a deal. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for me, and I'm eager to finalize this purchase.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $990000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on my investment.",990000.0,Alice,5,
