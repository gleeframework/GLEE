"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more than I was hoping for.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $90 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, so I'm thinking $85. Can you do that?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $85 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference again and go with $90. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to budge on $90, and I'm still not willing to pay $85. Let's meet in the middle from $80, which is the price I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking $87.50. Can you do that?",87.5,Bob,6,
