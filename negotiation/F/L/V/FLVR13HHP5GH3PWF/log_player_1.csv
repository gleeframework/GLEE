Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation, but still significantly lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $80, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's better to reject and try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more than I was hoping for."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $90 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, so I'm thinking $85. Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd prefer.  You're likely to get a better deal if you keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $85 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference again and go with $90. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to budge on $90, and I'm still not willing to pay $85. Let's meet in the middle from $80, which is the price I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking $87.50. Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation has gone on for a while, and Bob is clearly unwilling to go above $87.50.  While it's close to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John."
