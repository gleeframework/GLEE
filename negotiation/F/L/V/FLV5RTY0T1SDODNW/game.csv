"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be a good fit, $14,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand this is a valuable product Alice, but $13,000 is still more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle again at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,750. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I'm still looking for $12,800. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",12800.0,Alice,5,
