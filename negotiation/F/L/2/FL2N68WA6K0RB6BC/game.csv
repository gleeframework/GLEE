"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
