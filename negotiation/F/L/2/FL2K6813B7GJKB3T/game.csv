"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is my final offer on that price point.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm going to take a closer look at my pricing strategy and come back with a new offer. For now, I'll meet you at $15,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's find a way to make this work.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $15,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,7,
