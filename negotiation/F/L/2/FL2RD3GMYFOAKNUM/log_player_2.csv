Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,500? It's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still slightly above your maximum price point of $12,000. Since you're willing to pay $12,000, you should reject this offer and see if you can get Alice down to your target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final offer. It's your maximum budget and hopefully appealing enough for Alice to accept.  This puts the ball in Alice's court and lets her know you're serious about buying the product, but at your price."
