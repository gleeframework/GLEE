Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This allows some room for negotiation and hopefully, we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I will try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise from my previous offer and closer to Bob's offer. It's still a price that is above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've already shown a willingness to negotiate but Bob doesn't seem willing to meet me halfway.  Selling to John for $120 is the best option for me at this point."
