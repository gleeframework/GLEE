"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $120 to Bob, and it gives me some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $130.  I'll see if I can find a compromise with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $125. This is a small compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a profit while potentially closing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge on his price.  I've already gone down to $125, and there are only 6 rounds left.  Rather than risk further negotiation and the chance of not getting a deal, I'm going to sell to John for $120.  It's a guaranteed sale and my minimum price."
