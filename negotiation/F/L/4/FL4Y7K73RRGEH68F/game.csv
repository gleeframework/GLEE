"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I have to say, $900,000 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your transparency about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
