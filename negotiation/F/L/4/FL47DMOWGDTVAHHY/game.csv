"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we start with $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a reasonable profit.",875000.0,Bob,4,,
