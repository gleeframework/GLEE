"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we start with $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $925,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counter-offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with $925,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and I can likely secure a lower price by rejecting this offer and continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I think $912,500 is a fair price that balances our interests. I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. Let's meet at $912,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is getting closer to my desired price range, and while it's still higher than I'd prefer, I'm starting to run out of room for further negotiation.  The risk of continuing to bargain is that Alice might get frustrated and walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, as it saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
