"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $120 is less than what the product is worth to Alice, you can get a better deal from John for $100."
