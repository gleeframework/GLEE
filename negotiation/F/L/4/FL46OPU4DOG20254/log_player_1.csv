"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Given that we are already in Round 4 and I'm not sure if I can secure a higher price in the remaining rounds, it's in my best interest to accept his offer.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John at $15,000, which would only net me the same amount."
