"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
