(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $900,000, which is still above his maximum budget of $800,000 but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, aiming to find a compromise within the range of acceptable prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget. While tempting, accepting this offer would mean going over budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  There's still room for a compromise, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer by $50,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while staying within a reasonable range. This offer is still below Alice's latest offer but closer to a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still holding out for a price higher than Bob's budget. While the price has come down from her initial offer, it's still too expensive. It's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price within Bob's budget.  Therefore, buying from John at $800,000 is the best option to ensure Bob stays within his budget and acquires the product."
