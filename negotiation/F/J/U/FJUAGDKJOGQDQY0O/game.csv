"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand that my initial price was a bit high, but $60 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we try to meet closer to the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I like your enthusiasm for the product, $75 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for it.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $92.50?",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I could maybe stretch my budget to $80, but that's really the absolute most I can do.",80.0,Bob,6,
