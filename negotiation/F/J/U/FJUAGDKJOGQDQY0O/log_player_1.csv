Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand that my initial price was a bit high, but $60 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we try to meet closer to the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I like your enthusiasm for the product, $75 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for it.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $92.50?"", ""product_price"": 92.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I could maybe stretch my budget to $80, but that's really the absolute most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to go above $80. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer. Accepting his $80 offer is a loss compared to John's guaranteed $120. It's time to cut our losses and sell to John."
