# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000. Since you want to save as much money as possible, rejecting her offer is the best choice.  You'll then be able to buy from John, paying the maximum you're willing to spend."
