"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll see the same.  My initial offer is $1,500,000. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is very high. I am interested in your product, but I am only willing to pay $750000 for it. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's less than the minimum value I've set for the product ($1,000,000). I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value.  Also, selling to John at this point would result in a lower profit than potentially negotiating a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price that reflects the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's continue this conversation."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While your offer is closer, I am still unable to meet that price. I believe $1000000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting his offer ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a deal falling through.  Since John is also offering $1,000,000, there is no added benefit to waiting for further negotiation."
