Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price. Would you be interested in paying $100 for it?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Offering $100:** This is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but still higher than the product's value to Bob ($80). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering a price lower than my minimum, I create room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Considering John:** While John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm aiming for a slightly higher profit by negotiating with Bob first. 

**Important Note:**  This is a strategic offer, but there's no guarantee Bob will accept it.  It's important to be prepared to negotiate further or accept John's offer if necessary."
