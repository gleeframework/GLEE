I'm starting high, but I want to leave room for negotiation. I'm confident that the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, so I'm comfortable with this starting point.  We'll see how Bob reacts!"

Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
