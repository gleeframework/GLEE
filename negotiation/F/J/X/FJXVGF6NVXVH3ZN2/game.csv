"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $14,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my own costs. I hope we can reach an agreement this round.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer but still not quite there.  I'd be willing to do $13,500.  That's a significant increase from my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $13,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product for you and my own costs. Let's close this deal this round.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $13,750.  If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John.",13750.0,Bob,8,
