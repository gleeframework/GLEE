"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a significant discount from what the product is worth to Bob, but it still leaves me with a good profit. I believe this is a fair starting point that will encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal from Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,500.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway.  Hopefully, this is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum threshold."
