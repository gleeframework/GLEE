Bob should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Bob's Maximum:**  Bob is willing to spend a maximum of $15,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $14,000. 
* **John's Price:** John is selling the same product for $15,000.

While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, Bob can still save $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
