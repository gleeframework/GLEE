"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $15,000. How about we compromise at $13,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still below my minimum. Let's try $14,000. This is a significant step closer to my initial offer, and it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we compromise at $13,250? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",13250.0,Bob,6,
