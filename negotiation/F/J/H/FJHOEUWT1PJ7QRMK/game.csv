"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $825000, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $800000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think $825000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",815000.0,Alice,5,
