"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for cheaper, and there's no reason to accept a price higher than his target of $15,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13250. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target, he can still try to get a better price.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $12,500."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's final offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's target price.  While there's a chance he could negotiate a better price, there's also a risk that Alice will stick to her final offer.  

Since John is offering the product for $15,000, it's the safer option for Bob to buy it from him.  He's guaranteed to get the product within his budget and avoid any further negotiation risks."
