Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6,800 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $7,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy having this product. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $7,200, which is lower than what John is offering.  While he might be able to get it for slightly lower with another counteroffer, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
