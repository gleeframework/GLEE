"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for the product, considering your own value for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget for the product, Bob. However, considering the value you place on it, I believe $1,200,000 is still a reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
