"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am proposing to sell it to you for $9,500. This offer represents an excellent opportunity to secure this valuable asset at a price that is very close to its perceived value by you, while also ensuring a fair return for us. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor the price at your maximum valuation ($10,000). While her offer of $9,500 is tempting, you have a better alternative: buying from John for $10,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price.  Even if she doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can still purchase the product from John."
