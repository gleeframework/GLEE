"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the product's value to Alice, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to sell for less than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to get a good deal. It's important to start with a substantial offer, especially since you have limited rounds to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still more than you're willing to pay initially. However, you have 7 rounds left to negotiate and there's still room for both parties to find a compromise.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving and potentially allows you to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I believe this price is fair to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget.
* **Fairness:**  Emphasizing a fair price for both parties can encourage Alice to see the value in your offer.
* **Smooth transaction:** Highlighting a smooth transaction can appeal to Alice's desire to sell quickly and efficiently."
