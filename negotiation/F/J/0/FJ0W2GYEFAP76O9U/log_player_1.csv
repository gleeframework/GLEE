"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob to pique his interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a price that's likely to be immediately accepted, as I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is interesting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I still have 9 rounds left, giving me ample time to negotiate a higher price with Bob or potentially reach a better deal with John.  
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my commitment to my minimum value and encourages further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:**  I'm dropping the price by $1,000, showing flexibility but still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on value and flexibility:** I reiterate the product's value and emphasize the flexibility of my offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I keep the conversation amicable to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250?  I believe this price is fair to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Closing the Deal:**  While I could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  I'm already on round 4, and the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower offer or a rejection, forcing me to accept John's offer of $8,000."
