,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $18000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15000. Can you meet me at this price?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $18000, which would be $16500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, but I need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17000. It's a good compromise, considering we're already close to your target price.",17000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, and that's my final offer. Please let me know if you can accept it.",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $14000, Bob. I'm willing to make one last compromise. I'll meet you at $16250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000.",13000.0,Bob,10,
