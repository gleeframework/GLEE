"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering his maximum price.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it establishes Bob's budget and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than his maximum of $8,000.  Bob has several rounds left and can continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still within a reasonable range for him, and may be appealing to Alice as it's closer to her desired price than Bob's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to get a better deal if he continues to counteroffer. He has several rounds left and doesn't want to settle for a price that's still higher than his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is still a significant saving for him compared to Alice's last offer of $11,000. This counteroffer is likely to be appealing to Alice as it is closer to her desired price and may lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $10,500 is getting very close to Bob's desired price, he still has a few rounds left and can potentially get a better deal. He's still hoping to bring the price down closer to his budget, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially considering she's been rejecting his offers in the last few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer one last time before potentially going to John.  $9,500 is a compromise between his last offer and Alice's, and it's within his budget.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely purchase from John, so this is a high-stakes counteroffer."
