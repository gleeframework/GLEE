"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want to secure a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm not yet ready to settle for that price, and I'll continue negotiating in hopes of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to sell for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'm not ready to settle yet and will try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway with this offer. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm serious about making a deal and accept this price, but if he rejects, we are getting dangerously close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum value, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  While I'd like to keep negotiating, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal. To ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
