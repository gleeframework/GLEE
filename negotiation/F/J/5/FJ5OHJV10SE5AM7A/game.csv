"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a good price for both of us, so let's see if we can make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I'm trying to be fair here, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it would be a good deal for you.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,875 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to pay $10,800, which is a fair compromise and very close to my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",10800.0,Bob,6,
