"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much as possible.  While $115 is a better price than John's $120, it's still above your target of $120.  Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of getting a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to get the best price possible. A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her. This allows for some negotiation space while also reflecting your desire to stay under your $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within your budget of $120. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, potentially leading to a higher price or even a stalemate. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, as it guarantees you get the product at a price that is both affordable and beneficial."
