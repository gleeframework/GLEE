Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** $115 is above your $100 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  $115 is below Bob's $120 value, meaning he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **Reasonable starting point:**  It leaves room for both of you to adjust and find a mutually agreeable price."
