"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $2000000. This is a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is significantly below the value I place on this product.  To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value it holds for me. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion, but $1400000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm confident in the value of this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1550000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1350000. Can you consider that?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm concerned that we're getting too far apart on price. To demonstrate my willingness to come to a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to offer a final counteroffer of $1450000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your continued interest. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options. I'm hopeful we can make this deal happen.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
