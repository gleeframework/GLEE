{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $900,000 is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll receive. This can help encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high bar while leaving room for negotiation. I'm prepared to potentially make a counteroffer if needed, but my goal is to get as close to my minimum value ($1,000,000) as possible. I also have the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I cannot accept such a low price.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I will try to find a compromise that gets me closer to my desired price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always a fallback option if negotiations with Bob continue to be unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $850,000, which is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my goal of getting a higher price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget limitations while emphasizing the value he'll get. I'm also positioning this offer as a potential compromise, opening the door for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider.  If this is rejected, I'll need to assess whether further negotiation is worth my time or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that price point be feasible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  While it's closer than his previous offer, it's not yet within a range I can accept. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer. I'm prepared to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. If this final offer is rejected, I will sell to John to ensure I receive at least my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  As a final offer, I'm willing to sell for $800,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, given the product's worth and the potential for a quick sale elsewhere.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable value. This demonstrates my commitment to getting a fair price but also leaves no further room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my position, highlighting the product's value and the possibility of selling elsewhere to create a sense of urgency.  I'm also framing this as my final offer, signaling the end of negotiations.

**Strategy:**

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's still a good deal for him considering the product's value.  If he rejects this offer, I will immediately sell to John to ensure I receive my minimum value."
