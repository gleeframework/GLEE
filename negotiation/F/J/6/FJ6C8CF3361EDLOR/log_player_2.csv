"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make a fair offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is too high.  You are aiming to get the product for $12,000 or less.  It's better to reject the offer and counter-offer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to own this product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than my target price of $12,000.  I'm willing to risk going another round to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $12,000 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit out of my reach.  Could we settle on $12,500?  This would be a good middle ground for us both."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still a bit higher than your budget. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $12,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's possible we'll just go back and forth without finding a solution.  It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $12,000, as this ensures I get the product for my target price."
