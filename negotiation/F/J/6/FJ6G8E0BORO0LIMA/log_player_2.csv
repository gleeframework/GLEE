"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product of immense value. It's worth at least a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000.  This is a fair starting point considering the potential upside. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $750000 is too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $1250000? This reflects a significant compromise on my part. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
