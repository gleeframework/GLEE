"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product of immense value. It's worth at least a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000.  This is a fair starting point considering the potential upside. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $750000 is too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $1250000? This reflects a significant compromise on my part. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
