"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
