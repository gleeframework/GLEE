Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This gives me a decent profit while still being a reasonable price for Bob, considering the product's value to him. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise, offering Bob a slight discount from my initial offer while still giving me a decent profit. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $10,000, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to pay what the product is worth to me.  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures I get a fair price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
