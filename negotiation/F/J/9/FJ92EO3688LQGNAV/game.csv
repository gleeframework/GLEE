"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a competitive price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair for both of us, considering my budget and the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,4,
