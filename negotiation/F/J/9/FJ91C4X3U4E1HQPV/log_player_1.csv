Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer considering its worth to you would be $800,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it above that is essential.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's very keen, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Time Value of Money:** A quicker sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price than John's offer, could be advantageous if it avoids delays.

This strategy balances maximizing immediate profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
