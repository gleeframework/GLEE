"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're aiming to get the product for $800,000 or less. $950,000 is significantly above your target.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Backup option:** You have a reliable alternative in John, who's willing to sell for your desired price.  This gives you leverage in the negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she has come down, $900,000 is still above your target of $800,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  You can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.
* **Backup option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup, and he's offering the product for your desired price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
