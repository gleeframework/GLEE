Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it still represents a great deal for you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than selling to John, and it's getting closer to my desired price. I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
