"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still looking to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're willing to meet me at $1100000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1025000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal quickly.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to close the deal quickly, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to protect your profit margin, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1075000 and my previous offer of $1025000, which would be $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1075000 and $1050000, which would be $1062500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1062500.0,Alice,9,
