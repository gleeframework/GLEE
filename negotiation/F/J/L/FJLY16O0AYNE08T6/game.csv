,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, given its value to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still offers you a significant value, and hopefully we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise further. Let's meet at $1,050,000. This gives us both a good deal, and we can finally close this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still limited to $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering we're both getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal now.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
