Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I can start with a significantly higher offer to test Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, I'm subtly implying that the price is justified, even though I haven't explicitly revealed its worth to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially negotiate the price. This leaves room for me to potentially lower the price if needed, while still aiming for a higher profit. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer. If he does, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
