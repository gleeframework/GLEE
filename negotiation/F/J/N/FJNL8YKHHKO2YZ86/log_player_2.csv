"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget. He should start negotiating with Alice to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. How about we meet at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $10,500 is still more than he's willing to pay. He should counteroffer again to try and get the price down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm at $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, as you'd still be making a profit and I'd be getting a great deal on a product I really want."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a compromise, but gets me closer to my target price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, $9,500 is still higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  John offers a guaranteed price that fits within Bob's budget."
