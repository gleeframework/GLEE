"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. How about we meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm at $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, as you'd still be making a profit and I'd be getting a great deal on a product I really want.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a compromise, but gets me closer to my target price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
