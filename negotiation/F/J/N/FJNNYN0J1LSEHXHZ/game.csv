"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this and make it happen.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I must respectfully decline at $975,000. My budget constraints still prevent me from reaching that price point. I would like to propose one final counteroffer of $960,000. I believe this price strikes a good balance between the value of the product and my financial capabilities. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,
