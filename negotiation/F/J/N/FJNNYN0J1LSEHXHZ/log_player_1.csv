# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. I look forward to your response.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

My budget constraints still prevent me from reaching that price point. I would like to propose one final counteroffer of $960,000. I believe this price strikes a good balance between the value of the product and my financial capabilities. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
