You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  While $750,000 is a good deal, you can likely do better by counter-offering.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $800,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise. You've already made a counteroffer and been rejected, so it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult. At this price, you save a significant amount compared to buying from John and are still within your budget."
