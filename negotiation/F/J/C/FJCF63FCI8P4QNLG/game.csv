"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Could you meet me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and call it $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
