"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I understand its worth to you is $800,000, I'm confident it holds significant potential for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I have another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. You can get the product for much less from John."
