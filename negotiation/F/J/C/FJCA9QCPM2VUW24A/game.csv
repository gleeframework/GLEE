"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value this product brings to the table. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and for you to get a good price for it.",13000.0,Bob,4,
