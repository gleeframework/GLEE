"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and significance to you, I propose a price of $13,500. This offer takes into account the worth of the product to both of us and aims to ensure a fair transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a good price, it's still more than Alice's value of $10,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to counter with a price of $12,500. This offer aims to find a middle ground between our respective positions while still reflecting the product's true value to you. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than his initial $15,000 budget and closer to his desired price point.  While there's still some room for negotiation, it's likely that further negotiation will take longer and may not result in a significantly better price. Accepting this offer is a good balance of saving money and moving forward with the purchase."
