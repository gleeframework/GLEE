Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum desired value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired value of $15,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to that by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to $12,000. How about $11,500? This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
