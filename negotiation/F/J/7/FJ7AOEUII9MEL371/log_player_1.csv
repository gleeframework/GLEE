Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's valuation matches mine, he's starting at my lowest acceptable price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome. Selling to John guarantees a fair price without the risk of prolonged negotiation."
