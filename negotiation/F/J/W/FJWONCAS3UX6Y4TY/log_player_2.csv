Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still more than the product's value to Bob. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his value as possible. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,800 is a good price, Bob can still do better. He is willing to pay up to $15,000 from John, but  $11,800 is still more than what the product is worth to him. There is still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, and this counteroffer is a smaller reduction than the previous one, showing that he is getting serious about making a deal. He's also acknowledging Alice's position by moving slightly closer to her price. This approach helps keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating a lower price and is now at a point where Alice's offer is very close to his target value. While he could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject the offer and the deal might fall through.  Accepting the offer at $11,500 allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price without risking losing the deal."
