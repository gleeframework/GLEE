"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",100.0,Alice,3,
