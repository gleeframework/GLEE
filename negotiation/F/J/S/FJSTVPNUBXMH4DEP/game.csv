"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $11,000? That's still a good price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at that price.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about we settle on $10,875? This would give us both a good deal and ensure a smooth transaction.",10875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below $10,500 is my target. I'm willing to pay $10,750, but I'd rather not go any higher. Can you meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
