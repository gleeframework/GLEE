(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring options before committing to the full price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for potentially saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This aggressive approach might encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not my ideal price. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $1,050,000.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer, showing I'm serious about buying but still want a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1060000}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer again to $1,060,000. I'm getting closer to Alice's offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly lower price. I'm hoping Alice will recognize my commitment to buying the product and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,090,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer. While I'd ideally like to pay less, accepting this offer is the best option at this point. With only 3 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate further, and risking that Alice might walk away entirely.  It's better to secure the product at a good price rather than risk losing it altogether."
