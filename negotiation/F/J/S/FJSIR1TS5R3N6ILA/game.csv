"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a little too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This is a good price for both of us and I'm hoping we can close the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",8875.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,600 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,700. This is a final offer, and it's the best I can do. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",8700.0,Alice,7,
