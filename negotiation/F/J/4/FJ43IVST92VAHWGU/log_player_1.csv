Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000. By offering it at $11,500, she aims for a price significantly above her minimum ($10,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential perceived gain. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to John guarantees $10,000 but might take longer (finding and negotiating with another buyer).  A slightly lower price to Bob could lead to a faster sale.
* **Negotiation Room:** The message is phrased to suggest potential for negotiation if Bob counters. This keeps the door open for Alice to potentially get closer to her desired price."
