"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2,200,000. I would like to propose an alternative that better aligns with my financial situation. My counteroffer is $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value and the investment I've made in it. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  I believe this price reflects both the product's worth and my willingness to negotiate.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but based on my current financial situation and market research, $1,950,000 is still beyond my reach. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. This amount reflects a compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a significant gap from my original asking price. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,825,000. This price reflects the value I bring to the table while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
