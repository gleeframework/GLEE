Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  He has nothing to lose by trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $6,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He is trying to get the price down to $6,800.  He can continue to counter-offer and see if he can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $7,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not ready to accept $7,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has already gotten the price down to $7,100, which is a good deal for him.  He is also getting closer to his target price of $6,800.  Continuing to negotiate may not be worth the risk of Alice walking away from the deal.  If he rejects the offer, Alice might stick to her price, or even increase it.  It's better to secure the deal at this price than risk losing it."
