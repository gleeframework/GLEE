"Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a reasonable price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $97.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $97.50. I'll sell it to you for $106. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",106.0,Alice,5,
