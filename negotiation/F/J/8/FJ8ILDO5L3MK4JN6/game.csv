"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I've done my research as well, and I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. Can you meet me at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, and I'm hoping you'll accept this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
