"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need $11,500 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $11,250 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can make this work.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. I'll throw in a small concession, and I'll sell it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer.",11200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $11,100.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",11100.0,Bob,10,
