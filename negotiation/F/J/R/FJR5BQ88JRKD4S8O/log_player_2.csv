"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth considering a price of $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that aligns with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $950,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or you can stick with buying from John."
