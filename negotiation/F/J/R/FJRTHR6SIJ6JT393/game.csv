"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is below what I need to consider, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to accept $925,000 for the product. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and provides you with a great deal.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit too much for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $737,500?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",737500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $737,500 is simply too far from what I need to consider.  Let's try to meet halfway one more time.  I'm prepared to go down to $862,500.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",862500.0,Alice,5,
