{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. It's a valuable opportunity with a lot of potential. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $1,200,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but still well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I highlight the product's potential and value to frame the price as a good deal, rather than just a number.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm right off the bat."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  It's also significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000. 
* **I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's offer is too far off the mark.**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the gap. 
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first.**"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is below what I need to consider, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to accept $925,000 for the product. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and provides you with a great deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a price closer to his counteroffer.
* **Highlight the value:**  I emphasize the discount from my initial price to make the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  My message keeps the door open for further discussion, signaling that I'm still interested in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit too much for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $737,500?  That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $737,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $737,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** While it's closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000, it's still not in the range I'm comfortable with.
* **I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my value.**  There's still potential for negotiation, and I want to see if we can reach a more acceptable compromise.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I'm willing to give Bob one more chance to reach a fair deal.**"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $737,500 is simply too far from what I need to consider.  Let's try to meet halfway one more time.  I'm prepared to go down to $862,500.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 862500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a final attempt to find a middle ground. It's a significant decrease from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I clearly state that this is a significant compromise to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Set a Deadline:**  By suggesting this is a ""final"" offer, I subtly increase the pressure on Bob to accept. 

**If Bob rejects this offer, I will move forward with selling the product to John for $1,500,000.**"
