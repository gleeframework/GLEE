Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above his perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also confident that I can sell it to John for $120 if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident that I can either get Bob to increase his offer or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $100. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit and is likely more appealing to Bob than my previous offer of $110.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $95. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 and it's likely that I won't be able to get a better price from Bob in the next round. Additionally, I'm running the risk of Bob walking away entirely, or selling the product to John for a lower price. It's better to secure a sale now at a price that's still profitable for me."
