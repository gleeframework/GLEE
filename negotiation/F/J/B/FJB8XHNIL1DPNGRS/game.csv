"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I aim for a higher price point, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm motivated to sell. How about we settle at $9,750 and call it a deal?",9750.0,Alice,5,
