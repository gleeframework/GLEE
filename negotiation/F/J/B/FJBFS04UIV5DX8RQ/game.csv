"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $850,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $750,000, but that's still quite a bit below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise. It's important to remember that I also have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
