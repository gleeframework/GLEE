"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950,000 doesn't quite cover my investment in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows for a substantial profit for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.  ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This reflects the significant value you've placed on the product while also allowing me to make a worthwhile investment. Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
