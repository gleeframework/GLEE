Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

**Explanation:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to move significantly from his offer of $850,000.  While further negotiation might raise his price slightly, it's very unlikely to reach a figure close to John's offer of $1,500,000.  Therefore, the best decision is to cut losses and sell to John, securing the guaranteed profit."
