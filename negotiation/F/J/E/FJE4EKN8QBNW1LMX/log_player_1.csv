Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still lower than my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I want to give Bob some room to negotiate, but I'm confident I can get at least $14,000 as I have a backup buyer at $15,000.
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my floor of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. There's still a potential for a mutually acceptable price within the range of $13,000 to $15,000.
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage and allows me to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,500.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's in the middle of his offer ($13,000) and my previous offer ($14,000).
* **Reinforcing value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Positive and open:** Maintaining a friendly and open tone to encourage further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but no more. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John provides a better deal:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, which is a better outcome for me than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could waste my time and potentially lead to a lower offer or a prolonged negotiation process."
