Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation, but it still leaves room for negotiation if he's interested. I'm starting high, knowing I can always come down if necessary, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I will counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000. This counteroffer shows flexibility while remaining firm in my goal of a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $1,500,000."
