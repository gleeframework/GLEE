Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand that's your final offer, however, it's still a bit over my budget. I could meet you at $12,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $15,000.  I've given him a fair chance and a good final offer. It's time to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
