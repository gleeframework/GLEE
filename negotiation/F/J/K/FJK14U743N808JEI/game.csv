"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I really need to make a profit on this one. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $145. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still outside my budget.  I'm really hoping to find a deal closer to $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $145, so I'm counteroffering at $132.50. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling $125 would be fair for both of us. What do you say?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the last few rounds, and I'd like to make one more serious offer. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,7,
