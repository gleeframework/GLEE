{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation but still represents a significant gain for Bob.
* **Value Proposition:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers, keeping the negotiation open.  
* **Backup Plan:** The option to sell to John at $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is lower than expected, there's still potential for further negotiation.
* **Counteroffer Advantage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. This will keep the negotiation process going while ensuring I don't settle for a price below my minimum threshold."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows you to make a good profit, and it's closer to my expectations. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value and potential for Bob's business to encourage him to accept. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $900,000 is a significant amount for Bob, but it's still within a reasonable range for a product that's worth $800,000 to him.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the Gap:** Bridge the difference between our desired prices.
* **Maintain Control:** Keep the negotiation in my favor by not immediately accepting Bob's initial offer.
* **Maximize Profit:**  Secure a higher price than Bob's initial offer while leaving room for potential future negotiation."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and the value of the product. I would like to propose $890,000 as a fair price for the product. I believe this offer strikes a balance between respecting the value of the product and staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Threshold Reached:** Bob's offer of $890,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** The gap between our positions has narrowed, but further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a price closer to my target.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing time and potentially missing out on a guaranteed sale to John.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell the product for a higher price, selling to John at $1,000,000 ensures I meet my minimum requirement and avoids further negotiation with Bob. This decision minimizes risk and maximizes my earnings in the short term."
