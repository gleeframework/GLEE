Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in this product, $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,500,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still hesitant at $1,600,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

This offer is close to my desired price, and with only 6 rounds left, I'm worried about the risk of rejecting this deal and ending up with nothing.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,550,000."
