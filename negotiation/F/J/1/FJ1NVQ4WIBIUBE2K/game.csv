"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. Let's start with a price of $1,750,000. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in this product, $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still hesitant at $1,600,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
