"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
This product is worth $120 to Bob, so he should reject the first offer.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'm only willing to pay $100 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
Bob is trying to get the best price possible.  He starts with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $100 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to him, giving Alice some room to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  I could come down to $150.  This product is really worth it, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  While it's lower than the original price, it's still higher than his target of $120. He should continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 

Bob is getting closer to his target price. He's offering a price in the middle of his last offer and Alice's latest offer, showing he's willing to negotiate. This also leaves room for Alice to counter, but hopefully closer to Bob's target."
