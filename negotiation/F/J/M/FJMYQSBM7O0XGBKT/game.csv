"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $400,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into making it available. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $550,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $450,000.  Would that be workable?",450000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $520,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for you and the effort I've put into making it available. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",520000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me. I can tell this is important to both of us.  To be decisive, I'd be willing to go to $480,000.  That's my final offer - if it doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",480000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to make a final offer. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $500,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for you and the effort I've put into making it available. If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options, including selling to John for $800,000.",500000.0,Alice,7,
