"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, and sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
