"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95, let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $100. Alice is offering it for $95. While it's a better price than John's offer, you can still get a better deal. You should reject the offer and see if Alice will lower her price."
