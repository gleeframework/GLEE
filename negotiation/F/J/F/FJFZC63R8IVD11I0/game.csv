"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product and the discounts we've already discussed. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
