Round 3
Alice's offer:

```

Alice is getting closer to a price you'd accept, but it's still a bit high. You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying my best to make this work, but I need you to come down a little more. Would you consider $98?"",

}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make this work, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to meet you at $101. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting $101 saves you $19 compared to John's offer. It's a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
