I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to incentivize him to negotiate while still maintaining a significant profit margin. I'm confident I can get closer to my target value through negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while keeping my profit margin."

Bob's offer is now at $11,000 which is a good price for me. It is close to my initial offer of $11,500 and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
