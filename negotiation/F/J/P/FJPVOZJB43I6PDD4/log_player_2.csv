# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,600,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a significant amount to you.  Consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer lined up ready to pay $1,500,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice is trying to pressure you with another buyer, but you know John will sell it for $1,500,000. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the best chance of getting a lower price, even if it means calling her bluff."
