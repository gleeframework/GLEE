{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,200,000 is less than the price from John, there's still room for negotiation to potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows for counteroffers and a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This reflects my desire to pay as little as possible while acknowledging that Alice needs to make a profit. This offer is also well below my maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not at a price I'm completely happy with. There's room for further negotiation, and I believe I can secure a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue this negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  There's a possibility of a better deal, and I'm not willing to commit at this point.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing me to explore options and potentially achieve a better price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my maximum budget, I'm still not comfortable committing at this price.  Alice is showing signs of flexibility, so I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price before I reach my limit."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. However, it's still within my budget and below Alice's last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price that's favorable for me. I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted, given Alice's willingness to negotiate."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round before I have to buy from John. Alice's offer is getting close to my maximum budget, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to pay less, accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product without exceeding my limit.  It's also likely that Alice won't budge further in the final round."
