"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,800 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll accept $10,100 for the product. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",10100.0,Alice,5,
