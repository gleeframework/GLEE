While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to me.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,850,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're getting a great deal. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $1,850,000. While this is still more than what the product is worth to me, it's a reasonable compromise. It's also a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's better to accept the offer and close the deal."
