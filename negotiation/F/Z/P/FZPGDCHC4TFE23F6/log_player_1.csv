Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives the product as valuable or rare.
* **Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000, ensuring no loss."
