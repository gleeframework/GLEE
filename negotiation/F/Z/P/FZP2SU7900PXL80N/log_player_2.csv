"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $1,250,000. It's a substantial value at this price, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  Consider this your chance to acquire it at a price significantly lower than what others are willing to pay.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is $1,250,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best decision."
