I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This gives Bob a potential gain, while still ensuring I receive a profit. If Bob rejects, I can comfortably sell to John for my minimum price."
