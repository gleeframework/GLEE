Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
