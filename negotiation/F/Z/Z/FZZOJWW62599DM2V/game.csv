"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $8,500 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $7,750 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $8,200, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",8200.0,Alice,5,
