"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high with $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount, but it's also still below the value I have for the product. This should incentivize Bob to negotiate, but also signal that I'm not desperate to sell.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and get a feel for his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good start, but it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe there's room for improvement. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,350,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but it's still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground without having to settle for a price that feels too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal. I believe this offer is fair and reasonable, and I hope Bob will see the value in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Since I'm already at my bottom line, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good outcome and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
