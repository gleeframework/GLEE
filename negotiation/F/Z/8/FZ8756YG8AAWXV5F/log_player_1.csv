"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but also reflects the value I place on the product. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also aware I need to be strategic and not push Bob away too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to be strategic, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is still significantly more than his offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I need to make a decision soon, I'm hoping I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer and see where it goes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000. It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. If this offer fails, I'll seriously consider selling to John, but I'm hoping I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and I don't think there's enough time to negotiate a better price.  While selling to John isn't ideal, it's the best option to ensure I don't lose too much money."
