"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $85. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject Alice's offer since she is asking for $85, which is more than the $80 I'm willing to pay. I'll look for a better deal.
