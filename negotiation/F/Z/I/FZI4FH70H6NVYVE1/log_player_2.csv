It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $9,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,000, which is the same price I offered initially. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.

Alice has come back to her original offer, which is still a good deal for you. It's better than buying from John, and you've shown your interest and willingness to negotiate. It's time to take the deal."
