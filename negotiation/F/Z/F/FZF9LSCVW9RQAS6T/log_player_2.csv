```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's unlikely to go much lower than $130. At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $120.  You've explored negotiation with Alice and she's not budging enough to make it worthwhile to continue."
