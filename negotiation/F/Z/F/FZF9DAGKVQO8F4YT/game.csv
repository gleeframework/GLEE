"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. ",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $115 is still a little too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $95. If that works for you, we can make a deal. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a price that we can both be happy with.",105.0,Alice,5,
