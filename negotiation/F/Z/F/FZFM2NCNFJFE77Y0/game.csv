"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. While I see the value in the product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise for me and reflects a reasonable value for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
