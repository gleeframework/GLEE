"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $10750. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.",10500.0,Bob,4,
