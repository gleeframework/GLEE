"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While $12,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $13,250?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above $13,250. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is my final offer. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",13000.0,Bob,6,
