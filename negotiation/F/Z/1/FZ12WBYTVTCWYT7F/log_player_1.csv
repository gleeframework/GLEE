Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point as it's closer to my desired price point.  It also leaves Bob with a potential profit of $1000, which could incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as his counteroffer indicates he's interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? This is still a fair price for you, given the product's value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's meet in the middle.  Would you accept $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,750 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below it.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.  It's the safest and most reliable option."
