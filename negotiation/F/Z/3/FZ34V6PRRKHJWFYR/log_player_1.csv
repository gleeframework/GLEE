"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone can build rapport with Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I've included a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not in a rush to sell, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  While Bob may be willing to pay $120, there's a chance he'll come up in price if I counteroffer. 
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to see if he's truly serious about buying and how far he's willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $150, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle ground:**  $135 is a compromise that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with the option of selling to John for $120. 
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming more risky to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit."
