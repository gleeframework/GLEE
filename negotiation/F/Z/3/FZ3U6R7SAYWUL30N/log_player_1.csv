Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $95."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $100 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price, giving you some profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is a price point that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but might seem like a deal if he's particularly interested. 
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By offering it to Bob first, you create a sense of scarcity and opportunity.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $95. However, this strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
