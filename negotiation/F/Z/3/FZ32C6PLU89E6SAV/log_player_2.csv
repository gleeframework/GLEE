# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!

Alice's offer is way too high. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While $1,200,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  John's price of $1,000,000 is the best deal for me."
