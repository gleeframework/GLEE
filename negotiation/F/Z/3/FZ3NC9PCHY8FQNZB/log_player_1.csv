"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value of $12,000, and it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and see if it's worth further negotiation or if I should just sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also trying to be responsible with my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $12,000, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I will counteroffer him and try to get closer to my desired price.  I still have time to negotiate and don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't benefit me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be budget-conscious, but $11,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500. How about $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $11,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  I need to continue negotiating.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet because there's still a chance to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not quite seeing eye-to-eye on this. While I appreciate your offer, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $12,000.  It's my absolute minimum for this product. I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of our negotiations.  I've made several concessions, and I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to meet my price. To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a reasonable outcome and guarantees a sale."
