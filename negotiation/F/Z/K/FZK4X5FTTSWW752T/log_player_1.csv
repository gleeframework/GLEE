Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to find a middle ground where both parties can benefit.  It allows for potential counteroffers while also setting a strong initial position. I'm also keeping John in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,500 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  

**Reasoning:**

I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. There's still room for compromise, and I'm willing to explore that option before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000:** This price represents a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the idea of a ""fair price"" and the potential for reaching an agreement. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  By offering a compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the deal and avoid further rounds of back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would $8,750 be within your considerations? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still not quite where I want to be.  

**Reasoning:**

I'm confident that by continuing the negotiation, I can push the price even higher.  There's still room for compromise, and I'm willing to explore that option before resorting to selling to John.  It's worth risking a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  How about $8,900?  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but that's my final offer.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$8,900:** This price is a small concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility but still holding firm.
* **Message:** The message is direct and firm, stating it's my final offer and emphasizing the importance of closing the deal.

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired amount while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. By emphasizing this as my final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John."
