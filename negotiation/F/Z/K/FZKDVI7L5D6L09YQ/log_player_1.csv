Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without losing him to a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob saves $50,000 compared to his perceived value.
    * You earn $150,000 more than selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the chance he won't try to negotiate lower."
