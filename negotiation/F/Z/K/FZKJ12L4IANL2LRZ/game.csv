"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal as it's worth at least $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great deal.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about $10,750? This is a very fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
