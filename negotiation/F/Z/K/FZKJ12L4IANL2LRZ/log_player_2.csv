"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal as it's worth at least $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price of $15,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to get the negotiations moving in my favor.  $10,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $15,000 to me.  I'm aiming for a price somewhere between these two values."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing flexibility, but $11,000 is still above my target price. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price in the middle of our last two proposals. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and meet her halfway, while still staying within my budget. It's a good strategy to create a sense of compromise and potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about $10,750? This is a very fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $10,750 is still slightly higher than my target price, it's a good deal considering the value of the product to me.  At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars. I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
