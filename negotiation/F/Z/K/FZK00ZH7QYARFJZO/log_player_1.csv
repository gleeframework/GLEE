"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. This also leaves room for potential counteroffers and a possible compromise.  While my minimum value is $15,000, I'm aware that Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so I'm aiming for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Bob's initial value of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my value.  Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity, as I can potentially get a better price from Bob in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer of $17,000 to $16,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still being closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  This price point also leaves room for further negotiation, as Bob has already shown a willingness to go above his initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm starting to run out of rounds, selling to John at this point would be a loss for me compared to my minimum value.  Even though Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate. I believe there's a chance I can reach a more favorable price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm dropping to my absolute minimum price of $15,000. This demonstrates my firm commitment to getting a deal done, but it also sets a clear boundary.  I have limited rounds remaining, and it's crucial to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an acceptable agreement with Bob is too high. It's time to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid further negotiation that could result in a lower price."
