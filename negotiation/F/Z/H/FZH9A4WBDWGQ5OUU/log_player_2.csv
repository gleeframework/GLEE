"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $1,000,000 to you at a slightly discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $950,000.  Since Alice values the product at $800,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would still give you a good profit margin and would be a great deal for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer. Our current asking price is based on the value of the product and the market conditions. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This still provides a significant profit for us while offering you a substantial saving compared to the original price. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's still room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. It's a significant discount from your original offer and still gives you a healthy profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider an offer of $885,000 for the product. This proposal allows us to close the gap between our positions and ensures a reasonable profit for us, while still being a competitive price for you. I look forward to your response.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  At this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate might not yield a much lower price, and could potentially risk Alice walking away from the deal.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, saving Bob $115,000 compared to buying from John."
