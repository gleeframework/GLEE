"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $800,000 is simply too far off the mark.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm offering the product for $1,200,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to stay above $1,100,000. Let's split the difference and call it $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
