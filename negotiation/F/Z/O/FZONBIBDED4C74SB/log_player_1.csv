Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $17,500. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable enough to consider this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I won't settle for less than $15,000. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $16,000.  This is still above my minimum value but a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counter-offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low. I've already established that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
