"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Accepting Alice's offer saves money:** Buying from Alice for $14,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $15,000. 
* **The price is within Bob's budget:** $14,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000."
