# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're aiming for a price below $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You have 10 rounds and the option to counteroffer, giving you leverage to potentially get a lower price from Alice.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:**  Buying from John now would mean you spend $1,200,000, while rejecting and negotiating could lead to a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's not ridiculously low. It shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
