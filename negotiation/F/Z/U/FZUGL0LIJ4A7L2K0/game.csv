"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While $9,500 is tempting, I'm really looking to stay around $8,500. Would you be willing to come down a bit? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. However, $8,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $8,875 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,700. This is a good compromise that allows us both to reach a fair deal. What do you think?",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal.  However, $8,700 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $8,750.
