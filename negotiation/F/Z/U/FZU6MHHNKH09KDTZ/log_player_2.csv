"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice.  $110 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a reasonably lower offer than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $90 is a bit low, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $100? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is offering her lowest price, which is a good deal for us. It's time to accept and close the deal."
