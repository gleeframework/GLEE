"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I am willing to negotiate with you if you can lower your price closer to $8000, which is closer to its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $8500? This would still give you a good value for the product and allow me to make a reasonable profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I'm unable to meet your current offer of $8500. Could you consider reducing it further to $8200? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $8200 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet halfway again. How about $8300? This is closer to your offer but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",8300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider $8300, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my original proposal. Could you possibly lower the price to $8250? This would be a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $8250 is definitely getting closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's try $8275 as a compromise.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, allowing for a successful transaction and leaving us both happy with the outcome.",8275.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I appreciate your offer of $8275. I'm willing to move forward with a counteroffer of $8260. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",8260.0,Bob,8,
