"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a tempting offer, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to drop my price a bit, but  $12,000 is my absolute minimum. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,200. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $11,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise and still leaves me a bit of room to make a profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit shy of $11,500. How about we meet at $11,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already rejected several offers and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to take the $11,000 now than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for my minimum price."
