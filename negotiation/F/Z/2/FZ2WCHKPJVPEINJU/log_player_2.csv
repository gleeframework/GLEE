"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($120) is above your maximum price target ($150), but it's still a significant markup from her valuation ($80).** There's a chance you could get a better price by negotiating or waiting to see if she lowers it. 
* **You have a backup option (John) at $150.**  This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or potentially force her to lower the price to secure the sale."
