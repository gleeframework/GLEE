"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me at most. How about we start at $5,000 and see where we go from there?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on. However, $13,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,500 is still quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
