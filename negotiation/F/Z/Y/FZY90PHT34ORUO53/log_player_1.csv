Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) than your minimum ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $12,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still securing a significant profit.
* **First Refusal Incentive:** Highlighting this encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without trying to lowball you.

**It's important to note:**  This is a single round negotiation.  If Bob rejects the offer, you automatically sell to John for $8,000.  There's no opportunity to counter Bob's rejection."
