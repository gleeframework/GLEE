"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you, and I'd be happy to make a deal.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
