"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer, which is way above your budget.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is a better strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000.  This is my maximum budget, and it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  I'm hoping to secure a deal quickly and avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to pay a premium, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfortable range. It's better to keep negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
``` 

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's last price. I'm hoping to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still determined to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above my comfort zone.  While I'm getting closer to my ideal price, I want to see if I can get it even lower before committing.  I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $1,400,000. This is another step towards meeting Alice's price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable, but if not, I'm prepared to keep pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, but I think I'm getting a good deal.  I've already rejected a few of her offers, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from her.  It's time to accept this offer and close the deal."
