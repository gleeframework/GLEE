"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This reflects a more accurate valuation and still allows you to benefit greatly.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  While I value your interest, the $950,000 offer still falls short of what I consider fair. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000, which is my final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a resolution. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, as previously proposed, and that's my final offer. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
