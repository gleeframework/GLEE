Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should start with his target price of $800,000. This is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. This sets a clear expectation for Alice and begins the negotiation process."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price but should continue to push for a lower offer. Increasing his counteroffer to $950,000 shows he's willing to compromise, but still isn't willing to go above his initial target of $800,000."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's target price of $800,000.  There are only three rounds left. While further negotiation is possible, it is unlikely that Alice will come down to Bob's desired price. It's better for Bob to secure the product from John for $800,000 and avoid the risk of losing out on a deal altogether."
