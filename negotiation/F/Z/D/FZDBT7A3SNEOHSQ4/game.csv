"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to buy the product for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $650,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $725,000.  It's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $725,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  While $800,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you consider $760,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $790,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",790000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm ready to close this deal soon. Would you consider $775,000? It's a strong offer, and I believe it meets both of our needs.",775000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that you're willing to make a strong offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",795000.0,Alice,9,
