Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be a significant asset to you. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this offer represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) but still attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **First Offer Advantage:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and signals the product's value. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 if Bob declines. 

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to secure a significant portion of the value difference between your minimum and Bob's valuation. It also allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
