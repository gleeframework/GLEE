"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, even if we don't get all the way down to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable in the $9,000 range. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  We start with a significant drop from Alice's offer ($12,000) to signal strong interest in a lower price point. 
* **Reasonableness:** $9,000 is still significantly below Alice's perceived value ($15,000) but a good amount above our fallback option ($8,000).
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests we're open to further negotiation, giving Alice room to counter if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met us halfway, there's still a $2,500 difference between her offer and our fallback option ($8,000).
* **Testing the Waters:**  We want to see if Alice is willing to go lower or if she's firm on a price closer to $10,500.  

We'll continue to negotiate strategically, inching closer to our ideal price while being mindful that we have a viable alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $10,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Movement:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($750) to signal that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** This counteroffer keeps some pressure on Alice. She's losing potential profit with each counter, pushing her closer to either accepting a lower price or losing the sale.
* **""Fair Compromise"" Language:** Framing our offer as a ""fair compromise"" reinforces the idea of finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her final offer. While it's possible she might budge a little more, it's not guaranteed.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation is likely to yield only small concessions from Alice at this point.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Buying from John guarantees a $2,200 savings ($10,200 from Alice vs. $8,000 from John).

Although we might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal from Alice, the potential savings are no longer worth the risk of her sticking to her final offer and losing the opportunity to buy from John.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed savings."
