Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($14,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without trying to negotiate too much. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects the initial price, you can gradually lower it, always keeping in mind your $10,000 safety net with John."
