"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,500 is considerably lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers significant value that goes beyond your initial assessment.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
