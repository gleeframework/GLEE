Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,500 is considerably lower than what I'm willing to accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean losing out on a potential $500 or more. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
