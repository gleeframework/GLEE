{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for a profit, not just to cover your minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a strong opening position:** It shows you're confident in the product's worth and not afraid to ask for a good price. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that's high enough for you but also attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Show you're not desperate:** This signals you're willing to walk away if you don't get a price you're happy with.
* **Maintain leverage:**  You can use this rejection to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **See if Bob is truly serious:** If he's willing to walk away, it might be a sign that he's not a serious buyer.

You'll counter with a price closer to your initial offer to see if you can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You're not sticking to your original price, but you're also not accepting Bob's lowball offer.
* **Offers a reasonable middle ground:** This price is still attractive to Bob while providing you with a profit. 
* **Maintains a strong negotiating position:**  You're showing that you're serious about getting a fair price, but also open to negotiation.

Now, you'll see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to your desired outcome, it's still not high enough.  Here's why rejecting this offer makes sense:

* **Maintain leverage:** You're showing Bob you're not desperate to sell at any price. This keeps the pressure on him to make a better offer.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There's a chance Bob will realize his budget may be too low and increase his offer.
* **You're still above your minimum:**  You can always fall back to selling to John for $800,000 if this negotiation falls apart.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you're giving yourself the opportunity to potentially get closer to your desired price without losing out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still too far below what the product is worth. To be honest, I'm getting close to walking away and selling to another buyer who is willing to pay a fairer price.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows a firm stance:** You're not budging on your price significantly, indicating you're not desperate.
* **Highlights the potential loss:** Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and possible loss for Bob.
* **Offers a final compromise:**  This price is still above your minimum and likely within Bob's budget. 

By staying firm and offering a fair compromise, you aim to convince Bob that $1,100,000 is the best deal he can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. How about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,075,000 is closer to your desired outcome, it's still not high enough, and Bob's message indicates he's not willing to budge much further. It's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a much better price, and you're running the risk of prolonging the process. 

Selling to John guarantees you a minimum profit of $800,000, which is a safe and reliable option. It's better to secure a guaranteed profit now than to risk losing a potential sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
