"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer,  $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This still leaves you a good profit margin and is closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within your budget and leaves you with a healthy profit margin. It's also a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
