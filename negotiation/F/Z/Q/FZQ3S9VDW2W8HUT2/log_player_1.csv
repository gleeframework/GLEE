"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high opening offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. It leaves room for negotiation while still representing a substantial profit for me.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his initial rejection, but it's still below my desired profit margin. I want to see if I can push him higher, especially since I have several rounds left. Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and explore if there's more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  By lowering the price slightly, I'm showing flexibility while still maintaining a substantial profit. This counteroffer should gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and push him closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd ideally want to get more, it's getting late in the negotiation, and accepting his offer ensures a substantial profit.  There's a chance that I could get a slightly better deal in future rounds, but the risk of losing Bob completely and having to settle with John for a lower price outweighs the potential for a few more thousand dollars."
