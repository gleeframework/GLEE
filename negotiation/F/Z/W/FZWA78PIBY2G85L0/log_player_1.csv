Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it for $150 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price, netting us a larger profit than selling it to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $140 leaves room for negotiation while still being a price that's likely attractive to Bob (given it's worth $120 to him).
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct, mentions the price, and hints at the product's value to entice Bob. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
