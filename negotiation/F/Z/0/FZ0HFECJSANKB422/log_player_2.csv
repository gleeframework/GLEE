"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer ($1,400,000) is higher than her product valuation ($1,200,000), it's still significantly lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000) and the price John offers ($1,500,000). Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
