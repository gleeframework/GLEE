Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant benefits for you. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the baseline:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This is your absolute minimum.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  You want to go significantly higher than this to maximize your profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you could still settle at a price higher than John's offer.
* **Justifying the price:** The message emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to encourage Bob to see the value beyond his initial assessment.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers. 
* Gauge Bob's interest level. If he seems completely uninterested at this price, a significant adjustment might be needed to avoid losing the sale."
