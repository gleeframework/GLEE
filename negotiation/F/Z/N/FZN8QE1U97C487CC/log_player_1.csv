Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $10,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than $10,000.  Bob clearly recognizes the value of the product, and I think there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $10.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,500.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's better than selling to John for $8,000 and I'm getting closer to my desired price point.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
