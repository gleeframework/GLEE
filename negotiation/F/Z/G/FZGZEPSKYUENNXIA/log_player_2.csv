Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.  I'm still hoping to get a better price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,800. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the original price I had in mind. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my target. I'm willing to keep negotiating because I think I can get a better price. Even though John is offering the product for $10,000, it's worth it for me to see if I can get it cheaper from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,800 is still out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,200. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,200. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. Even though there are a few rounds left, I don't see any room for further negotiation, and it's likely that Alice will not budge from her offer. It's better to go with the certainty of getting the product from John for $10,000 rather than risking a failed negotiation and ending up with nothing."
