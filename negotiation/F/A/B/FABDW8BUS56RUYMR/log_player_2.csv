"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is currently priced above your maximum budget. It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have multiple rounds to work with.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This aggressive counteroffer serves two purposes:

1. **Sets a strong negotiation tone:** Shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal.
2. **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Allows for potential compromises throughout the remaining rounds.

I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget while still leaving some room for negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and I'm not willing to accept a price that high. There are still more rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $10,500. This is closer to Alice's latest offer but still leaves room for some negotiation. I'm trying to find a price point where we both might be willing to compromise.  I'm also mindful of my maximum budget of $10,000 and want to avoid going over that unless it's absolutely necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my maximum budget. While I'm starting to get closer to a possible agreement, I'm still not willing to accept a price that high. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and I want to explore all options before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway and demonstrates my serious intention to reach an agreement. With only a few rounds left, I want to signal a willingness to make a deal while staying within my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only three rounds remaining, and Alice's offer being very close to my maximum budget, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance I could get a better deal, but there's also a risk of losing out altogether if Alice refuses to budge further. 

To secure the product within my budget and avoid the risk of a stalemate, I'm choosing to buy it from John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed purchase at my desired price point, ensuring I don't overspend."
