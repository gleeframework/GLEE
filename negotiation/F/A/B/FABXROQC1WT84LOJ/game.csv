"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 for it to make sense for me. How about $1,350,000? This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your desire to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000. Can we try $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
