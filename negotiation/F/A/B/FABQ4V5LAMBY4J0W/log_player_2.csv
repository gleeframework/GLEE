"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm looking for $120 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum price of $150.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for me, and much better than buying from John for $150.  There's a chance I could get it lower with another counter-offer, but at this point, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for saving a few more dollars."
