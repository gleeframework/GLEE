"Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $95. That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $102? It's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $102 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and go with $98.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Bob,6,
