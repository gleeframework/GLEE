"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, at $18,000, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. This price is still lower than what the product is worth to me, but leaves some margin for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take $8,000, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me, and I still have more rounds to potentially negotiate a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's try to find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $8,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is right at the value he placed on the product, so it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
