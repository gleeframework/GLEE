# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth more than what you're willing to pay, while also securing a favorable deal for me. Let's make this transaction happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your willingness to negotiate. However, I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $10,500. How about considering $11,000 as a compromise? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.
