"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your willingness to negotiate. However, I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $10,500. How about considering $11,000 as a compromise? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,750. This is a fair price that allows for a small profit margin for you and is within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
