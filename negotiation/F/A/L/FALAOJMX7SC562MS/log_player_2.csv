Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $8,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $7,800 for the product. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $7,800, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for a potential $200 difference."
