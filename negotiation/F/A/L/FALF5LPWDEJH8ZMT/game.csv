"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the item, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? I understand if this is not feasible, but I wanted to ask nonetheless.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's worth at least $120 to me. But I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
