"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to me, but considering its importance to you, I believe it's a perfect match. I am offering this exceptional product to you at a special price of $12,000. I understand that its worth to you is $15,000, and I hope this offer aligns with your expectations while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:**  Alice might be willing to lower the price further to make the sale.
* **Get closer to John's price:** Even if Alice doesn't budge much, getting closer to $15,000 might make buying from John more palatable if negotiations fail. 

You have more to gain by rejecting this initial offer and seeing how the negotiation progresses."
