"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, but still within a range that I believe Bob might consider. This gives me room to negotiate if he counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering with $175. This is still above my minimum price, but a step down from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him in the remaining rounds. Since John is also offering the same amount, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
