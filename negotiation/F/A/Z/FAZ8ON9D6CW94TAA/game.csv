"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,500? This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  $11,500 is my final offer.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it lets me move this product quickly.  Let me know if you're interested.",11500.0,Alice,5,
