"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. It's best to negotiate for a lower price since there's a significant gap between her offer and John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to begin negotiations with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Significant Difference:** A $10,000 counteroffer highlights the significant difference between Alice's offer and your perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer leaves space for a compromise closer to a price you find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,500? This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still slightly above what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further and see if we can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** We're moving closer to a potential agreement, so it's strategic to make smaller counteroffers.
* **Targeting a Range:** Aiming for $11,000 keeps us below John's price while showing Alice we're willing to compromise. 
* **Encouraging Compromise:**  Suggesting a ""middle ground"" encourages Alice to consider options between her previous offer and our current one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  $11,500 is my final offer.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it lets me move this product quickly.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice's offer of $11,500 is a reasonable compromise and saves you $500 compared to John's price. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to go lower. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and potential lost opportunity. Accepting now secures the deal."
