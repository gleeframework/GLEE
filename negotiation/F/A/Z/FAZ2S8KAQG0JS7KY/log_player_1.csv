Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's maximum gives the impression of a deal and leaves a small window for potential negotiation if he counters.
* **Backup Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no pressure to accept a lower offer from Bob. 

By setting the price at $11,999, I'm aiming to secure the highest possible profit while acknowledging Bob's perceived value and leaving a small margin for potential counter-offers."
