"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking $120 to start. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Could you do $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is low, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy we're finding some middle ground here.  How about $90, and we have a deal?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $90 is still a bit more than I hoped to spend.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,6,
