Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $120 to Bob. Offering it at $100 leaves a good margin for him while ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $100 is a strong starting point, there's a chance Bob might negotiate for a slightly lower price. 
* **Above the John Threshold:** It's crucial that the offered price is significantly higher than your guaranteed sale price to John ($80). This ensures you maximize your potential profit if Bob accepts."
