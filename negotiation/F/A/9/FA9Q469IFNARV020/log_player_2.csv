"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is asking for $110.  While this is a good deal, you can likely do better by negotiating. Rejecting the offer opens the door for you to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about $105? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is now offering $105.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile:** While you could try to push for a lower price, it's possible Alice might not budge further, and you risk losing the deal. 
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, which might not be worth it for a potential saving of $5."
