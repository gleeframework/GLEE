"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm confident that the product's value will only increase over time. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to lower the price to $820,000. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $820,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $800,000. However, I've already considered selling the product to another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay the full value of $800,000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I need a decision from you today.",825000.0,Alice,5,
