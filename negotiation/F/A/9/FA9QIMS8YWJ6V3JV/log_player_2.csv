"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $850,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $800,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm confident that the product's value will only increase over time. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to lower the price to $820,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $820,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $800,000. However, I've already considered selling the product to another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay the full value of $800,000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I need a decision from you today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $825,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
