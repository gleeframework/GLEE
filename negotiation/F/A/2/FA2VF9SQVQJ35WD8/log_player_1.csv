Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $150 to you, you anchor Bob's perception of its value.
* **""Special Offer"" Framing:**  Offering the product to Bob before a public listing creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While aiming high, the $125 offer ensures a profit even if Bob negotiates down a little. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed your minimum price from John."
