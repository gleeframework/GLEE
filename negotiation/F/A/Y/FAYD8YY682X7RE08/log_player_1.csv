"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I'm not giving away too much value right away.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob would get from purchasing the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end the message by asking for Bob's thoughts, indicating I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1300000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still have room to negotiate.  It's too early in the process to accept his offer. I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective, $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value we're both getting out of this deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I emphasize that my counteroffer is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive tone, encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1325000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,300,000.  Considering that I have already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and we are in the middle of the process, it's a good idea to close the deal now.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of him walking away or me getting a worse deal in the future."
