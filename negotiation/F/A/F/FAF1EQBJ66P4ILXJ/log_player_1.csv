"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good practice to start with a slightly higher price than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive Framing:**  Starting with a positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round.  I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response, and the possibility of selling to John will always be a factor in my decisions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:**  While Bob's offer is within his budget, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter-offer and try to find a middle ground.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John would guarantee $100, but I'm still hopeful that I can get more from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to counteroffer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:** While $95 is a good price for me, I'm still leaving room to potentially negotiate down slightly if necessary.

**Important Note:** The outcome of this round depends on Bob's response. I'll continue to adapt my strategy based on his actions, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to stick to my budget of $80. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unwavering Budget:** Bob is firmly sticking to his budget of $80, showing a lack of flexibility.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's a risk of going back and forth with Bob, potentially wasting valuable rounds without getting closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:**  With four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing. Selling to John would guarantee $100, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Possible Counter-Offer:** I could potentially make a counter-offer, but there's a good chance Bob would reject it again. 

**Next Steps:**  While I'm still open to negotiations, the possibility of selling to John is becoming increasingly attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're committed to your budget. However, I'm not able to go lower than $90. If you're truly serious about purchasing the product, I'm willing to make this final concession."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm lowering my price slightly to $90, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate but emphasizing that it's my final offer.
* **Urgency:** The message subtly creates a sense of urgency by implying that this is my final offer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, allowing me to make a profit.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, we've reached an agreement.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider John's offer more seriously in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $80. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firmly at $80, and I've already made concessions. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price and ensures I make a profit. 

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of not closing a deal and the possibility of getting a guaranteed profit from John make selling to him the best decision at this point."
