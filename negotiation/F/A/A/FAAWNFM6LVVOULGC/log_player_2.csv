"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Offering the lowest possible price within his budget ($10,000) maximizes his potential savings. While Alice might reject this offer, it establishes a clear starting point for negotiations and puts pressure on her to lower her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000, but he's trying to get the best deal. Offering $11,000 is a compromise, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying but still wants to negotiate. This might incentivize Alice to make a final concession."
