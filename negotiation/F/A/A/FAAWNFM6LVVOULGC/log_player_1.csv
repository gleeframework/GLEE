Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $12,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer but more in line with what I believe is a fair price. I'm hoping he will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd ideally get more, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob or losing out on the sale to John."
