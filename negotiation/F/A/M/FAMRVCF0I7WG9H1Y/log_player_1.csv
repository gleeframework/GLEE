"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.  This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit.  I'll see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get more from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it significantly higher than what John would offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $9,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  We only have a few rounds left, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm making a final push to try and meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, but I'm not going any lower. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's tempting, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  We're down to the wire, but I'm hoping to get that extra $500!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm coming down to $10,000, which is still a good profit for me.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get more, $8,000 is still a good profit, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
