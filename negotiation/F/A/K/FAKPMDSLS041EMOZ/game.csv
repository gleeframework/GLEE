,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go lower than $92. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm not going to go any lower. If you're interested, let me know, but I'm not going to budge.",92.0,Alice,5,
