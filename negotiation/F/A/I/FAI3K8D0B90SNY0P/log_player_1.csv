Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion to gauge his interest and potentially get him to make the first counteroffer."
