"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1500000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This reflects the unique value of this product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value and my budget.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1300000 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $1350000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
