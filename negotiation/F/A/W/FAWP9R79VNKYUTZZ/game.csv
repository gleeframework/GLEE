"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
