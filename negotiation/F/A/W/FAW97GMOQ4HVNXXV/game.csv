"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but  $1,100,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $1,850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,350,000? I feel this price point recognizes the product's value while working within my constraints.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,350,000 is still pushing the lower limits of what I can accept.  Would you consider $1,650,000? That's a substantial discount from my original offer and would represent a fair deal for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I could manage $1,450,000.  I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value and our current positions.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
