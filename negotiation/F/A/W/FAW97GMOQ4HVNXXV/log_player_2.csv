Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but  $1,100,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This feels like a fair compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,350,000 is still pushing the lower limits of what I can accept.  Would you consider $1,650,000? That's a substantial discount from my original offer and would represent a fair deal for both of us.
