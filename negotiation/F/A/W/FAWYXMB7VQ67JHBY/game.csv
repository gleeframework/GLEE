"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit high for me right now. Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we both see the value in this product.  $9,750 is close, but I need to get at least $10,000 out of this. This is my final offer, so let me know if we have a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
