Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $15,000 for the product. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
