Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating it, the message implies the product's value is even higher than Bob's perceived $15,000.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a safety net with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

By starting high, Alice increases her chances of:

1. **Bob accepting immediately:** If Bob is eager, he might agree to the $20,000.
2. **Negotiating down:** Bob might counter-offer, leading to a price potentially higher than $15,000. 

Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything as she has John as a guaranteed buyer."
