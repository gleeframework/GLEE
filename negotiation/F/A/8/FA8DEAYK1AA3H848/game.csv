"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you valuing the product so highly, but $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $11500? I think that's a fair price considering what I'm looking for.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12500 to make this work.  It's a fair price given the product's value, and I'm confident it's worth it to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about $12500. How about we split the difference and settle on $12250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
