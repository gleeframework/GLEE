Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you valuing the product so highly, but $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $11500? I think that's a fair price considering what I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
