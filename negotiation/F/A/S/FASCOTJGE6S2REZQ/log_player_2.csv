"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to Bob, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's starting his counteroffer with a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This aggressive counteroffer is intended to show Alice he's serious about getting a good deal and to potentially force her to compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is a good compromise. It's a significant step closer to Bob's desired price of $10,500. Accepting the offer would allow Bob to save $1,200 compared to buying from John, while still securing the product he wants.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly better price, but there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or Bob having to buy from John at a higher cost.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical decision for Bob."
