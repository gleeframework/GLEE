"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go quite that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
