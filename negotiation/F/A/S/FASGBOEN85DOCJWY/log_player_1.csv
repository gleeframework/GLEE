Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $100 acts as your safety net.

By offering the product at $130, you're:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but you have some wiggle room to potentially settle around $120-$125.
* **Maximizing potential profit:** This price point is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Staying below Bob's perceived value:**  The offer is still attractive to Bob, as it's less than his maximum valuation. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale at a profitable price and leaving room for negotiation to maximize your earnings."
