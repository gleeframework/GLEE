"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little too steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a significant step up from my last offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both made concessions.  Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,5,
