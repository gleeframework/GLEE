"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,000 for the product. This is my best counteroffer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I can offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. This is my final counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $11,000.  It's very close to my budget limit, and I'd like to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value we've discussed.  Let me know your thoughts.",9500.0,Bob,6,
