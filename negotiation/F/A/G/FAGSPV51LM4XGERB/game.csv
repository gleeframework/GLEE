"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This price is fair and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000.  However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's seal the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $1,320,000. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing too much profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable at $1,320,000.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,310,000. This is a reasonable compromise that's close to your last offer and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'll come down to $1,320,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'm willing to do a deal at $1,320,000, but I expect you to commit to the sale now. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to explore other options.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
