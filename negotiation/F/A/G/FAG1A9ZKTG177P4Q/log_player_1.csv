Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob.  A starting price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the ""immense value"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit by:

1. **Testing Bob's willingness to pay:**  If Bob accepts the $1,500,000, you've made a great deal.
2. **Leaving room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you can negotiate down towards your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, knowing John provides a safety net."
