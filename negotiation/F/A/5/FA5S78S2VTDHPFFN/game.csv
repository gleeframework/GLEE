"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While it sounds promising,  $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I'm looking to gain from this product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm willing to provide.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can afford. If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a challenging offer for me, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. Considering your maximum budget, I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
