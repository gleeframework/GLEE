,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $9,000 for the product.  I'm confident it will be worth it to you in the long run. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to get at least $8,900 for the product. It's a valuable item, and I believe you'll find it to be worth every penny.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $8,900 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,800. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm getting close to my maximum budget.",8800.0,Bob,6,
