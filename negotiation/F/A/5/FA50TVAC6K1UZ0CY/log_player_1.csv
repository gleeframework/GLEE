{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be immensely valuable to your operations, even more so than its market value. I'm willing to make this transaction particularly smooth for you. What would you say to a price of $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your absolute bottom line. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle it down.
* **Justification:**  Simply throwing out a number can make Bob defensive. By mentioning that the product is worth more than its market value *to him*,  we are subtly justifying the high price. 
* **""Smooth Transaction""**: This implies we're willing to be flexible on other terms (perhaps payment schedule) to sweeten the deal and make accepting more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we want to maximize profit, the offered price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling around $1,000,000 which is still a significant profit for us.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will walk away at this price. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at our minimum acceptable price, we're in a strong position to aim higher with Bob."
