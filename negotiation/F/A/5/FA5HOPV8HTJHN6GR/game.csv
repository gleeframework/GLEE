"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective.  While I understand your offer, I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,250,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
