I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this offer is high enough to pique Bob's interest but not so high that it's immediately rejected. 

By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest level and potentially secure a profitable sale. If he rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum price, but still leaves room for improvement.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I want to see if I can secure a deal closer to my initial asking price of $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,600,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe there's still room for a higher price.  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering $1,450,000, which is a reasonable compromise and closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept this price to close the deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is only $50,000 lower than my last counteroffer, and it's significantly higher than John's offer. I believe this is a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation."
