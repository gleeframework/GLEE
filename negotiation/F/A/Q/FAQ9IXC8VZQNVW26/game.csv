"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
