"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep, but $650,000 is a significant discount from the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I believe the product would be valuable to my business, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but $725,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'll offer you the product for $850,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Alice,5,
