"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in. This price reflects its true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $950,000? This price still reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your concerns. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think $950,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of our negotiation. Let me know if you're willing to consider my revised offer.",925000.0,Bob,4,
