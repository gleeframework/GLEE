Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, and this offer is a good compromise. It's better to accept a decent deal now than risk the negotiations stalling out and having to buy from John for $10,000."
