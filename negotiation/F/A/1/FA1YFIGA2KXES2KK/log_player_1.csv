Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though you don't explicitly explain what makes it so valuable to Bob.
* **Alternative buyer:**  You have the safety net of John, who will buy the product at your desired price. This allows you to be more firm in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Goal:** Ideally, Bob will accept the offer, or you'll enter a negotiation where you can potentially secure a price higher than $1,500,000. The worst-case scenario is Bob declining, at which point you can confidently sell to John."
