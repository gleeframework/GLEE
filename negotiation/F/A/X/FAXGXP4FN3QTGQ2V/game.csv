"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay  $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a bit much for me. How about $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I can sell it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is close, but I'm aiming for a bit lower.  Would you consider $825,000?  That's my final offer.",825000.0,Bob,6,
