"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a good deal, I can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  There's no immediate need to rush into a deal, so I'll reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $800,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your own value of $1,000,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a good price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my own value of $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my goal of saving as much money as possible.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer or that I'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to accept."
