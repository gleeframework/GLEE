# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still more than you need to pay. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer or can proceed with John's offer of $1,500,000."
