Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and significantly lower than John's guaranteed purchase price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if vague) can make Bob more receptive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $140, there's a chance Bob might negotiate. This strategy allows for a potential compromise while staying above the $150 backup offer."
