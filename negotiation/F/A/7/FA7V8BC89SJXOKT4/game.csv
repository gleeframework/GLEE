"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair compromise that meets us both halfway. Let's close this deal and get this product to you.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $11,500 is the right price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting at least $14,000 for the product. Can you think about meeting me at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good price, but $13,500 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a good compromise and a fair price for the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not convinced that $12,500 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $14,000, which would be $13,250. Can you consider this offer?",13250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,250, which would be $12,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise that will allow us to close this deal. What do you think?",12875.0,Bob,8,
