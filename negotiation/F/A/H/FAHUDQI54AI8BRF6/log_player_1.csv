{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to accept no less than $1,200,000, so you have room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It shows good faith:** The offer isn't too aggressive, indicating you're open to a reasonable deal.

This strategy allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving you the opportunity to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. You can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am unable to agree to $1,100,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's higher than his initial value of $1,000,000. This means there's room for further negotiation.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially securing a price closer to your desired value. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob, as you might be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  You can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm happy to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:**  Shows that you're willing to compromise while still maintaining some profit.
* **Is closer to your minimum:**  Reduces the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Indicates a final offer:**  Provides a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider your offer seriously.

This approach aims to reach a compromise while maintaining your desired profit margin. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always choose to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to consider $1,060,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this might be a mutually beneficial solution for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's important to consider the following:

* **Negotiation Progress:** You've successfully brought the price up from Bob's initial offer of $1,050,000.
* **Potential Risk:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price or a complete breakdown, forcing you to sell to John.
* **Time Value:** Continuing the negotiation might take longer, potentially delaying your profit.

Accepting Bob's offer at $1,060,000 secures a sale and allows you to earn a profit, albeit smaller than your initial desired amount. This option balances the potential risk of further negotiation with the opportunity to get a deal done quickly."
