# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm not sure if Alice's offer is the best deal. I can get the same product from John for $10,000, which is still within my budget of $10,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
