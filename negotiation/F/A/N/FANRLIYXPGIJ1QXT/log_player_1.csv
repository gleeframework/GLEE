Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if necessary, but I'm not going to give it away for less than $100.  John's offer gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my asking price, but I'm not willing to drop to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's still a great deal for a product like this!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $95 is still slightly below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might drag this out further, and I'm not sure I can get a better price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
