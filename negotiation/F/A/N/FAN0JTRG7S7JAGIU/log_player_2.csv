"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I can aim for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to come down."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still offers you a significant benefit, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,400,000, which is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject my counteroffer and I'd be stuck with John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures a good price and avoids further risk."
