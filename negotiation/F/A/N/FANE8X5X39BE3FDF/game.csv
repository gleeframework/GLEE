"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit steep for me. How about we try $85? I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $92? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,6,
