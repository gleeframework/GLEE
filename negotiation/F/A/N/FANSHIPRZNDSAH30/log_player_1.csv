Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:**  This is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum value ($15,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **The message:**  It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to me, hinting at its potential value to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit. 
* I'm leaving the door open for negotiation.
* I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
