"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15000 is a bit out of my budget for this. I'm interested in this product and would be willing to pay $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. Would you be willing to consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $14000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13000? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. So, the total value you'll get is $14000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",13000.0,Alice,5,
