"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? That's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than John's offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's already shown Alice he's willing to walk away, and that gives him leverage. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and could lead to a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's try $12,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're firm on your price. While I'm happy to negotiate, $12500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $13000 one more time. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has rejected Alice's offer twice and made two counteroffers. The negotiation is getting close to a stalemate.  $13,000 is a good price for Bob, saving him $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's a chance of getting a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on is high. It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product at a decent price."
