Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm really interested in this product and hope we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
