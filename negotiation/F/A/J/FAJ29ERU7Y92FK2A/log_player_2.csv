"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, so this price offers a slight premium while still being very attractive. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to frame the offer attractively, you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  There's no logical reason to pay $50,000 more to Alice."
