"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. Let me know if you're interested!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'd like to know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle this time.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is still a bit lower than my original offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is at least $15000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and it's the highest price I'm willing to pay.",16000.0,Bob,6,
