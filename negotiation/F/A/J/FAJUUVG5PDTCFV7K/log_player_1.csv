"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  A high initial offer will reveal whether Bob is seriously interested in the product and has a budget that could potentially match my expectations.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By starting high, I have space to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Encourage counteroffers:**  A high initial price encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process, giving me valuable information about his valuation.

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy. Bob might immediately reject the offer and potentially walk away. However, it also has the potential to lead to a much higher sale price if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues my product.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and continue the negotiation process. I can now send a counteroffer that's more in line with my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer of $1,500,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $900,000.  

Here's why I chose this number:

* **Reasonable compromise:**  This price shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it also reflects the value I place on the product. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he accepts, I've secured a decent price. If he rejects, it gives me more information about his bottom line.
* **Time pressure:**  With 7 rounds remaining, I want to start getting closer to a final price.

**Important Note:**  I'm still keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product, even with a limited number of rounds remaining.

**My reasoning:**

* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and pressure Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:**  Accepting $850,000 would be a significant loss for me, especially considering I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I still have 6 rounds to try and secure a better price.

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I am prepared to sell to John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,100,000 represents a further compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 

Here's my strategy:

* **Closing the gap:** I'm reducing the price difference between my offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining value:**  $1,100,000 is still a good price for my product and ensures I don't significantly undervalue it.
* **Time pressure:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  I'm aiming to close the deal soon to avoid the risk of running out of time.

This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's flexibility and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects, I'll have to consider the risk of losing a potential sale and potentially sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a difficult decision, but I've decided to sell to John for $1,000,000. Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, the chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is decreasing.
* **Value proposition:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John guarantees a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Uncertainty with Bob:**  Bob's consistent low offers suggest he might not be willing to meet my price expectations even in the remaining rounds.

Selling to John provides a secure and known outcome, ensuring a sale within the time constraints and avoiding potential further losses in negotiations with Bob."
