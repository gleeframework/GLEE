Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it's valuable to you at $1,300,000. We understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and we aim to bridge the gap while maximizing our earnings. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than Alice's minimum. This means there's room for negotiation. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We've carefully considered your most recent proposal and are willing to negotiate further. We would like to suggest a price of $1,325,000 for the product. This offers a slight increase from our previous offer and allows us to maintain our profit margin while being more flexible. We hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's previous counteroffer, and it's closer to Bob's ideal price.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob running out of rounds.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and only slightly higher than his initial target."
