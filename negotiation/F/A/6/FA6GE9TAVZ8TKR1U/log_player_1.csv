"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still within Bob's potential value range, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to subtly remind Bob of its worth.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of his price range and can adjust accordingly.  I'm also leaving the option to sell to John open if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I could accept this offer and get some money, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further rounds.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  The option to sell to John for $10,000 is always on the table, so I'm not taking a huge risk by rejecting this offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. If he's serious about buying, he'll likely come up some in his next offer. This strategy allows me to see how far Bob is willing to go and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a fantastic price for you, and it's closer to my value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm still aiming for a price that's close to my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer. This shows good faith and signals that I'm serious about a deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""fantastic price"" for Bob, reminding him that he's still getting a good deal.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept this offer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to slowly close the gap between our desired prices. This counter-offer is a compromise that should encourage Bob to come back with a more reasonable price. If he rejects again, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob has moved slightly closer to my price, it's not enough for me to accept. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I want to see if he's willing to go higher.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. By showing that I'm firm on my minimum price, I might encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $8,800 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,200. This price reflects the value you'll get from it, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward!"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm again adjusting my offer, this time coming down to $9,200, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current one. This signals my willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages him to do the same.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a ""good deal for both of us,"" highlighting that we can both benefit from a successful transaction. 
* **Enthusiasm and Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""finalize this"" and ""move forward"" to create a sense of momentum and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strong attempt to bridge the remaining gap. If Bob still rejects, I'll have to carefully consider selling to John, as we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  We have only 4 rounds left, so I need to be strategic about my decisions. While I want to secure the best price possible, I also don't want to risk losing the deal completely.
* **John's Offer:** I still have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which is my target price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still below my minimum. If Bob doesn't come up significantly in his next offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting close to the end of the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep talking, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9,100. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get, and it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise by dropping my price to $9,100. This shows flexibility and willingness to work with Bob.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds left, I need to be strategic and avoid getting stuck in a stalemate.
* **Fair Price:** I'm reiterating that $9,100 is a fair price based on the value the product offers Bob. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm using positive language and encouraging Bob to reach an agreement in the next few rounds.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a last-ditch effort to secure a deal with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round to ensure I get my minimum price. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price, but I'm also realistic about the time constraint."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8,700 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,700 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We have only two rounds left, and there's a high likelihood that Bob won't increase his offer significantly.
* **John's Offer:**  John is offering my target price of $10,000, which guarantees I'll get my desired value.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer. With only two rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better price from Bob are slim.  It's more beneficial for me to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
