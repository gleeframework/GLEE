"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $16,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.",16250.0,Alice,5,
