Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down in price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

Bob should offer Alice the minimum he is willing to pay, $1,000,000. This is the price John is selling the product for, and Bob has no incentive to pay more.  Alice may reject this offer, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
