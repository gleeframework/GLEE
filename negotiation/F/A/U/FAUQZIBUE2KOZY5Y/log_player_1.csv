I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to earn a good profit. I believe this offer is reasonable and will hopefully encourage Bob to engage in further discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that significantly undervalues the product.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it shows my willingness to negotiate. I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to what I want, it's still not enough. I believe I can get a better price, so I'll counteroffer again."

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000.  This is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will accept. If not, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and will seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to run out of time.  I've lowered my price as much as I'm willing to, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal.  Selling to John will guarantee me a good profit and secure the transaction."
