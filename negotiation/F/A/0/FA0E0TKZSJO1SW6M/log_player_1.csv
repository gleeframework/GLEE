"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for my next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I have more rounds to negotiate and can still sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm still holding out for a better price and have several rounds left. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. I'm starting to get closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount. I believe this is a fair compromise that shows my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm starting to run out of time, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than my minimum, and I believe I have a better chance of getting closer to my desired amount if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $14,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that is higher than my minimum. With only a few rounds left, I need to show flexibility to avoid selling to John for my minimum. I believe this offer is fair and still reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision.  Bob's offer of $9,000 is far below my minimum, and I'm unlikely to get a better price from him in the remaining rounds.  It's better to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum and avoid losing more time and potentially getting a lower price."
