"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges both your budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his budget."
