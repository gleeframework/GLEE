"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value to me. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges both your budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which I believe is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to meet in the middle. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
