# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, but I can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer allows us both to benefit significantly from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price,  $1,050,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm confident I can negotiate further and get a better price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want us to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  My final offer is $1,010,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects my willingness to negotiate. I believe it's a fair price that considers the value this product offers.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her offer is now very close to my counteroffer.  While I might be able to squeeze out a little more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product at a good price and avoid further negotiation."
