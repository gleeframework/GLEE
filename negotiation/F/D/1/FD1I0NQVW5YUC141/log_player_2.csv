Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1025000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to make one final offer of $1100000. This reflects the true value of the product and is a price that I believe will be beneficial for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this final offer, I'll be forced to sell the product to another buyer for $1200000.  It's up to you, Bob.  Let me know your decision.
