{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the value to Bob, suggesting that the price is fair.
* **Openness:** I invite Bob to respond and keep the negotiation open. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1000000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price, potentially closer to my initial offer.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, but I'm hoping to do better by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product to Bob and try to find a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This would give you a good deal while allowing me to secure a reasonable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. 
* **Appealing to Reason:**  I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is fair and beneficial to both parties. 
* **Maintaining the Negotiation:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation moving forward and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer and decide on my next move.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup if the negotiation with Bob fails to reach a satisfactory agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I'm still looking to keep my investment under $1000000. Could we perhaps aim for $1025000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since I'm willing to sell to John for $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:**  This is my safety net.  If the negotiation with Bob falls apart, I can secure my minimum value by selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. I'll also emphasize that this is my final offer and I will accept John's offer if Bob doesn't accept. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product to Bob and try to find a compromise. I'll also be firm in my stance and not be afraid to walk away from the deal if necessary."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to make one final offer of $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product and is a price that I believe will be beneficial for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  I'm firm on the price and I'm making it clear that I'm willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential benefits he will gain from acquiring it. 
* **Setting a Deadline:**  I'm setting a clear deadline by mentioning the alternative buyer. This creates a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Decision:** I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll immediately contact John and sell the product to him. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll finalize the deal with John if Bob doesn't accept my final offer."
