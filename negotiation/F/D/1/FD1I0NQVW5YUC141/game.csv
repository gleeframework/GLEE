"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1000000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This would give you a good deal while allowing me to secure a reasonable price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I'm still looking to keep my investment under $1000000. Could we perhaps aim for $1025000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1025000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to make one final offer of $1100000. This reflects the true value of the product and is a price that I believe will be beneficial for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this final offer, I'll be forced to sell the product to another buyer for $1200000.  It's up to you, Bob.  Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
