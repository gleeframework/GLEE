Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I can start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The $10,000 offer isn't excessively high, but it gives Bob the impression that I'm valuing the product highly. It opens the door for him to counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price between $8,000 and $10,000.
* **Highlighting value:** By mentioning that the product ""holds significant value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth, which could make him more receptive to a higher price."
