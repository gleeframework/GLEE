prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that John provides a safety net. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just throw out a number; it emphasizes ""value"" and ""potential"" to frame the price in a positive light.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and encouraging discussion. Alice wants to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:**  While not provided in the prompt, knowing if $800,000 is the absolute ceiling for Bob's valuation would be crucial in real-world scenarios.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This is just the opening move. Alice's success depends on her ability to read Bob's responses and adjust her approach accordingly."
