"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum price. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating. It's still possible to get the price lower, and Bob doesn't want to lose the opportunity to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not there. I'm willing to pay $12,000, my absolute maximum. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
