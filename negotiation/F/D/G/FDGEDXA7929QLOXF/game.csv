"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
