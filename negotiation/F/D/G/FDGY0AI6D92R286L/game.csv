"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1500000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll see a significant return.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1350000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to feel comfortable.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 still doesn't quite cover the true value of this product.  To make this work, I'm willing to meet in the middle at $1350000. This is my final offer, and it reflects a significant compromise on my part.  Let me know if you're able to accept.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1350000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, as I mentioned before. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
