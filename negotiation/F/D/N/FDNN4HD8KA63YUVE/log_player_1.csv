"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll see how Bob reacts before potentially adjusting my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130. This shows flexibility and could encourage Bob to close the deal, while still giving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is now within my acceptable profit range and it's getting closer to the end of the rounds. It's time to secure the deal."
