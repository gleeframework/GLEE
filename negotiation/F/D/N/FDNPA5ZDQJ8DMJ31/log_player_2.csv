"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum value. It's worth exploring if he can get a better deal through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer sets a firm price that is well below Alice's initial offer but still above Bob's maximum value. 
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer and shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $10,500 is a reasonable compromise, leaving room for Alice to potentially counter.  

This strategy aims to  establish a negotiation baseline and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Even though Alice has lowered the price, $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum value of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  

It's better for Bob to continue trying to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance he might be able to secure a better deal, especially if he continues to demonstrate a firm but respectful approach to the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer establishes a firm price point, indicating Bob's willingness to walk away if necessary. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:** The message emphasizes that this is a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Last Chance:** This offer is closer to Alice's potential acceptance point, potentially pushing her towards a decision.

This approach aims to close the deal while staying within Bob's budget. However, if Alice rejects, Bob should be prepared to switch to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $11,000 and my original price of $12,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,750. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Maximum:**  Alice's offer of $11,750 is very close to Bob's maximum value of $10,000.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** There is little room for further negotiation without exceeding Bob's budget.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of rounds and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John at a better price. 

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept John's offer of $10,000. This ensures a purchase within his budget and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
