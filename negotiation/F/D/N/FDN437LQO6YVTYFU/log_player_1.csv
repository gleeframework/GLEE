Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, as I'm confident John will buy it for that amount if Bob declines. This gives Bob a clear understanding of my bottom line and starts the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that undervalues my product. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower price, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give away the product for much less than my minimum value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm confident I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
