Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it to be a great value."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation. While $200 is more than Bob wants to pay, it's important to give the impression the product is highly valued. This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle that's still profitable for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $125 is better than nothing, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $125 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $175?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By coming down to $175, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his price.
* **Still Profitable:** This price point is still significantly above my minimum of $150 and allows for a decent profit margin.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counter-offer gauges Bob's interest. If he accepts, it's a win. If he rejects and offers something closer to $150, I can consider accepting. If his counter is too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $175.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $150.  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $150 meets my absolute minimum price. While I could try to push for a bit more, there's no guarantee Bob would go higher, and I risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting this offer guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
