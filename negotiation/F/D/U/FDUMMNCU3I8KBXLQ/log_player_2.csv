The price is way over my budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}

I'm starting with a very low offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get the price down to a point where it's worth buying from her instead of John."

While $155 is getting closer, I'm still determined to try and get it lower.  I think I can still convince Alice to come down a bit more."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is stubborn and not willing to budge much. I've run out of time and I'm not willing to risk her rejecting my next counteroffer. I'll go with John's offer, it's the best I can get at this point."
