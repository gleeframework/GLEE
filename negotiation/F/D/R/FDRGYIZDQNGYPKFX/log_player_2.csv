"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with your backup plan.
