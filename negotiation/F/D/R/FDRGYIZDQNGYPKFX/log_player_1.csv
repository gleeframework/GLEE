Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and your minimum ($10,000) allows you to potentially maximize profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A higher initial offer gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have additional information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay."
