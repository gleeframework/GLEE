Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $230. I think you'll find it's a great deal for such a high-quality item."",
 ""product_price"": 230
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and even Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Anchoring:** The high initial price acts as an anchor. Even though it's unlikely Bob will accept, it sets a reference point that might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer quickly instead of dismissing the offer outright.

My strategy is to slowly decrease the price during negotiations, aiming to settle somewhere above my minimum while staying aware that I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $230 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to maximize my profit, accepting such a low offer would be a substantial loss. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to gauge his willingness to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $120 is quite low for this product - it's high-quality and in demand. How about we meet in the middle at $190?"",
 ""product_price"": 190
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Justification:**  I'm politely rejecting Bob's low offer while explaining why it's unacceptable.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Not Really):** While I'm phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" $190 is closer to my desired price than Bob's. This anchors the negotiation closer to my range.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is high-quality, but I'm still a bit far from the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you at $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is now above my absolute minimum of $150. While I could try to push for a bit more, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable profit ($140 is still significantly more than his perceived value of $80) and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer entirely. 
 
It's always good to leave a negotiation feeling like both parties got a decent deal, and this price point accomplishes that."
