,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $230 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $120 is quite low for this product - it's high-quality and in demand. How about we meet in the middle at $190?",190.0,Alice,3,
