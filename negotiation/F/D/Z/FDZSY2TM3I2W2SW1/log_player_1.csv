**Reasoning:** 

Bob is stubbornly sticking around his initial offer and seems unwilling to move significantly towards Alice's price. It's unlikely he will drastically change his approach in the remaining rounds. Given this, accepting his current offer of $9,500 means a loss for Alice compared to John's guaranteed $10,000. It's in Alice's best interest to cut her losses and secure the safe deal with John."
