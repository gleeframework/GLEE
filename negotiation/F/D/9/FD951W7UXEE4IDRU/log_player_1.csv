Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential negotiation.  It's also important to note that this is a very valuable product to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than $800,000.  I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offers if necessary, but I'm hoping to secure a good price in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $900,000 is a good price for me, and I'm not sure I can get much higher in the remaining rounds.  It's important to keep in mind that I still have the option to sell to John for $800,000, but this offer is a good deal."
