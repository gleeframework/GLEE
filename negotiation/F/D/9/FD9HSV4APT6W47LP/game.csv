,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.  Let's close this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
