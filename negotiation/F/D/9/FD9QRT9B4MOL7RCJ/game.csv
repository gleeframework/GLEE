"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this investment will yield substantial returns for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $2,000,000 reflects its true worth. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also confident in the product's value on the open market.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,800,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,800,000 for the product.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,900,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can we meet at this price?",1850000.0,Bob,6,
