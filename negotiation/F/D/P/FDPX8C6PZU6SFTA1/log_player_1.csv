Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer:

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
