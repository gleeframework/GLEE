"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,500. It's a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I can get it from John for $8,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
