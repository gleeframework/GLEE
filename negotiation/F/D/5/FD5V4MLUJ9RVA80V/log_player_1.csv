``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering the product at its minimum value to me, knowing Bob values it at the same amount. This ensures a deal is possible.  We'll see if Bob counteroffers, and if he does, I'll adjust my strategy. I'm also aware of John as a backup buyer, giving me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to accept such a drastic reduction. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm confident I can get a better price than $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to compromise. How about $900,000? That's a significant discount from my original price, and it still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum value.  It's a good compromise, and it's important to me to secure the sale. I'm confident that I can make up for the lower price with other opportunities."
