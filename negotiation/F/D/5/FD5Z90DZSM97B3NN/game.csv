"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount given its true potential.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $1,000,000. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
