"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $13,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than her product's value to her, you can get a better deal from John for $12,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this better option."
