Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $1,200,000 (our guaranteed price from John), there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice. This price is also significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, increasing the perceived value of the product.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer, and we'd have to sell to John at the lower price. However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
