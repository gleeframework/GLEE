# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?
