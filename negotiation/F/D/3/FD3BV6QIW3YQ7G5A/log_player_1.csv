Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Limit:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, but that doesn't mean he won't pay more if he sees significant value.
* **Starting High:** I'm starting above his perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **John as Leverage:** I haven't explicitly mentioned John, but knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price gives me a strong negotiating position.
* **Finding a Balance:** The goal is to find a price Bob is willing to pay while maximizing my profit.  $1,300,000 seems like a strong opening move."
