Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This allows for potential profit, but also encourages Bob to counteroffer, allowing for more back-and-forth and a possible better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for my minimum value just yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to $120, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to a middle ground. This shows flexibility while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $110 is close enough to my minimum value to accept. It's also a better deal than selling to John for $100."
