"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I believe this product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise for both of us. I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, so I'd like to make one more offer before considering other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your understanding.  I'd like to settle this and am willing to move a bit. How about we agree on $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you working with me. To get this done, I can offer $1,000,000.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to meet my minimum price of $1,000,000. However, considering we've been negotiating for a while, I'd like to try to get a bit more out of this deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1,020,000. This is my last offer, and I hope you can understand that I need to maximize my return on this investment.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
