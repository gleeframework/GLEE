"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, highlighting its potential worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not just stating a price but also showing willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I have 10 rounds to close a deal. While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, there's still potential to get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product, and it gives you a significant saving compared to my initial offer. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's worth to justify my price point.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm using positive language to encourage a compromise and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  We are nearing the middle ground, and there is still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if we can get a better price than $1,000,000 from Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to get a good price for my product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm making a counteroffer that is the midpoint between my last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's last offer ($950,000). This shows I am actively seeking a solution.
* **Finality:** I am framing this as a potential final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Good Price:** While it's lower than my initial goal, it is still above my minimum acceptable price and a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are already halfway through the 10 rounds. There is a risk that we won't reach an agreement that meets my minimum requirement, and I could end up with nothing.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is the minimum I am willing to accept. 

**Conclusion:** While I would prefer to get a slightly higher price, it's safer to secure the guaranteed deal with John. The time constraint and the risk of not reaching a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob make this the most practical decision."
