,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,320,000. This allows us to move forward while also saving you some money. I hope this is acceptable.",1320000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,320,000 is still not quite there for me.  To make this work, I'd need to see $1,340,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've thought about it carefully and am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,330,000? This is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while also being within my budget.",1330000.0,Bob,6,
