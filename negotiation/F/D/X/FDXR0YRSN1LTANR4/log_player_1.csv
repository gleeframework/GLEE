I'm still holding out for a higher price.  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,320,000 is still not quite there for me.  To make this work, I'd need to see $1,340,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've thought about it carefully and am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,330,000? This is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while also being within my budget.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
