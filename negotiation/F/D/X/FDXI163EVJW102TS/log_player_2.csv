Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $800,000. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I'm confident this price still represents a good value for both parties.

Alice is showing flexibility, but we can still try to get a better price. Let's counter with something closer to our initial target."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  This represents a significant move from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $835,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, and we're getting close to our target. Accepting at $835,000 is a good deal, saving us a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's worth closing the deal now rather than risking further negotiations and potentially losing the opportunity."
