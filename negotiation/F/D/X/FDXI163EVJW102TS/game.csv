"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential for negotiation and the value we both see in this deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $800,000. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I'm confident this price still represents a good value for both parties.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  This represents a significant move from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this transaction.",825000.0,Bob,4,
