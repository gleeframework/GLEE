"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob. This sets a high anchor and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I mention the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question to invite Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still above the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. There's still room for me to counteroffer and potentially reach a better deal. Selling to John would guarantee me $800,000, but I'm hoping to get more by continuing with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm  countering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise while maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" for both of us, aiming to create a sense of shared benefit.
* **Call to Action:** I invite Bob to meet me in the middle, hoping to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $850,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering we are both trying to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to accept his offer. While I could try to squeeze out another $25,000, there's a good chance that continuing to negotiate would lead to a stalemate, and I'd end up selling to John for $800,000 anyway. It's better to close the deal now and secure a profit."
