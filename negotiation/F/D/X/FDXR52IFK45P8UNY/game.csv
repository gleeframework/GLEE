"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
