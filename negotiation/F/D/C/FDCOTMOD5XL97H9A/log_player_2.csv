"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for some negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point that reflects Bob's desire to save money, but it's also not so low that Alice is likely to immediately reject it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's first offer, Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's already shown that he's willing to negotiate, and there's still some room to get the price down further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  Let's meet at $8,750.  This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step down from Alice's offer, showing that Bob is willing to negotiate but still pushing for a price closer to his desired range.  $8,750 is a middle ground that might entice Alice to accept, especially since it's only $250 away from her previous offer."
