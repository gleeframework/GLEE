"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I believe this price is fair considering the product's worth and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit on this deal. How about $1,600,000? This price is still within your budget and reflects the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer.  If you're willing to accept it, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
