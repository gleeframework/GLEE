Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob can counteroffer, allowing you to potentially get closer to your desired price. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** He still gets a good deal, making him more likely to accept.

Remember, the key is to strike a balance between getting the best price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below your minimum desired price of $800,000. While you could accept his offer and make a profit, it's better to keep negotiating with Bob and see if you can get a better price.  

* **Rejecting his offer** allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $950,000.

* **Selling to John** would be a guaranteed profit, but it's less than what you could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  The product is worth more than $850,000, considering its value to you.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $900,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still staying above your minimum price. 
* **Appeal to Logic:** You highlight the product's value to Bob, suggesting the $900,000 price is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly encourages a continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly below your desired price, it is above your minimum threshold of $800,000.  Considering:

* **Profit:** You'll still make a profit, and it's better than selling to John for a lower price.
* **Negotiation Length:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.  

Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, mitigating the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
