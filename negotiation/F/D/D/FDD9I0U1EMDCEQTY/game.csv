"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price that I believe is fair and mutually beneficial. I'm asking for $1500000.  I'm confident it's a value you'll appreciate. Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1500000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is significantly below the value I'm placing on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to recoup a portion of the value I'm invested in this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1200000 is still beyond what I can reasonably pay. Let's meet in the middle at $900000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still hesitant to go lower than $1100000.  This price reflects the value of this unique product, and it allows for a reasonable profit margin. I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $950000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer and within my budget. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,6,
