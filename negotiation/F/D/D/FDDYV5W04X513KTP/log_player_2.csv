"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $90. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $5 lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to get a better deal.  Since Alice values the product at $80, this price is still above her minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $87.50. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $87.50, which is only $2.50 above my target price of $85. This is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept the offer."
