Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price is fair and reflects the potential benefit I see in owning this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close the deal at this price.
