"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000? This gives you a significant saving while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. While your offer is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's try $1,275,000. This price is closer to your offer while allowing me to reach a reasonable price for the product.  I'm confident we can close this deal if we continue to work together.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
