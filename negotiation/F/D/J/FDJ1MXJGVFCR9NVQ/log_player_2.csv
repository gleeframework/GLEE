"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's clear we are far apart in our valuations. Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating and hopefully reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $18,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. It's important to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Rejecting the offer allows me to send a counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,000 is still a bit too high, I'm prepared to offer $10,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop to $16,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my budget. While she states it's her final offer, I can continue to negotiate. Rejecting allows me to send a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. It's also worth considering that if we don't reach an agreement, I can always buy from John for $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 12000}
