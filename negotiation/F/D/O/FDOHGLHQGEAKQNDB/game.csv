"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $15,500.  This is a very fair price, and I hope we can finalize the deal here.",15500.0,Alice,5,
