"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is far too expensive for Bob's budget.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible while staying within his budget. Offering $700,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob is taking a calculated risk here.  He's offering the maximum he's willing to pay, but it's still a good deal for him.  He's hoping Alice will accept, as it's closer to her last offer, but he can always fall back on John if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  Even though he's willing to go up to $800,000, he's already had four rounds of negotiation and there's no guarantee Alice will accept his next offer.  It's time to secure the product and avoid further risk, so he should buy it from John."
