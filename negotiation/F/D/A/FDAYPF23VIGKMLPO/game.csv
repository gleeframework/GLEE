"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,150,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
