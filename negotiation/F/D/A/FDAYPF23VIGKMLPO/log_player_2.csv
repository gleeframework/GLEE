"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above my maximum value. I can potentially save more money by counteroffering and negotiating with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,150,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still within my budget and significantly lower than her initial offer.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings. It's a good deal for both of us."
