``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a substantial profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,150,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
