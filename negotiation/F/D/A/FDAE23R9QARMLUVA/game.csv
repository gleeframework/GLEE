"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and based on my understanding of your needs, it could be a game-changer.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about we discuss a price of $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't justify going as low as $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, and I respect your position. However, considering my financial situation, I can't agree to $1,900,000. Let's try $1,750,000. It's still a premium price, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value you're offering.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,825,000?  This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your efforts. I've considered your proposal carefully, but I must respectfully decline at $1,825,000. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1,775,000? I hope this brings us closer to a fair agreement.",1775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close the gap.  Would you consider $1,800,000?  I believe that's my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've reviewed our negotiations and am willing to go up to $1,780,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",1780000.0,Bob,8,
