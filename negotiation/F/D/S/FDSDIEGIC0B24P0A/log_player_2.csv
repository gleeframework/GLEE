"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the value of the product to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I think I can do better than that. Let's try $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still too high for me, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might not result in a price I'm comfortable with.  To ensure I get the product at my desired price point, I'm going to buy it from John for $10,000."
