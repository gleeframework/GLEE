"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18,000 is way too high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  This is a fair price for me considering its value. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the value of the product to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for me, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I think I can do better than that. Let's try $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the value it holds for me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
