Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $850,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer, it's still above my budget. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $820,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'll meet you right at the top of your budget, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $810,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my price but still isn't at my budget.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and go with John's offer for $800,000.  It's within my budget and saves me time and further negotiation."
