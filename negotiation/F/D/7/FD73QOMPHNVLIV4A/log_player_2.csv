"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
