Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before it hits the open market. Given its unique value and features, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to get you to lower the price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""exclusive opportunity,""  you aim to justify the high price, even though you know Bob values it less.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Phrases like ""What do you think?"" encourage Bob to engage in a dialogue rather than just giving a flat rejection.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you want to maximize profit, pushing Bob too hard might make him walk away. Gauge his reactions if possible. 
* **Alternative Guaranteed:** You have the safety net of John's offer, which allows you to be a bit bolder with Bob."
