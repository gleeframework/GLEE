"Alice,  $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,900,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000,  which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
