"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $15,500? This is still a good deal for you, as it's less than what it's worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While $15,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $13,500? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,
