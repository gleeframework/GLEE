"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $15,500? This is still a good deal for you, as it's less than what it's worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While $15,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $13,500? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with that amount. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems Bob is unlikely to budge much higher. To ensure I get a price that is closer to my desired range, I'll go ahead and sell the product to John for $15,000."
