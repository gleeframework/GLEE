"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
