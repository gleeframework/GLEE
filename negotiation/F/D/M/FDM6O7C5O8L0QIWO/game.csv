"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150, my absolute maximum. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is your absolute maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $165. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",165.0,Alice,5,
