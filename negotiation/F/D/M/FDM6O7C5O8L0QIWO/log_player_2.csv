"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $150. It's worth rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. $125 is a good starting point that reflects my budget while also showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $175 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150, my absolute maximum. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now offering my absolute maximum price, making it clear that I'm serious about buying the product but have a firm budget. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is your absolute maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $165. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $165 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. While I could continue negotiating, I'm wary of going further.  It seems like Alice might be stubborn and unwilling to budge further, and with only 5 rounds left, there's a risk I might end up paying more than I want.  It's more prudent to take the guaranteed deal with John at $150."
