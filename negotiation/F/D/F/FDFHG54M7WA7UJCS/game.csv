"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, which would be $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
