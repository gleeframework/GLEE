Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:**  A positive and friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I've left enough room for Bob to counteroffer and for me to potentially compromise.
* **Backup plan:**  I'm keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price.  
* **Room for improvement:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $13,000. 

While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting,  I believe there's a chance to secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (splitting the difference) to make it seem more logical and fair.
* **Staying above minimum:**  The price is still above my minimum of $15,000.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion and negotiation, keeping the possibility of a deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, which would be $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum of $15,000. While I could continue to negotiate, the potential gains are minimal. 
* **Time is money:** Further negotiation might take longer and could potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob, or even a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.  

Given the limited room for improvement with Bob and the guarantee of a higher price with John, selling the product to John is the most financially advantageous option."
