Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation.  While $1,700,000 is likely too high for Bob, it signals my seriousness and allows for a potential compromise. I'll be ready to counter if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could accept and get something, it's significantly below my minimum value.  I'll reject and make a counter-offer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,550,000.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  I hope this counteroffer is attractive enough to Bob, while still leaving me with a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not willing to accept anything below $1,500,000. I'll reject and try to counter once more.  If he rejects again, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to make one final counteroffer at $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit. If Bob rejects this, I'll accept John's offer to avoid any further risk of losing out on a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and it's clear we're not going to agree on a price.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell to John.  While it's less than my initial asking price, it's still a good outcome."
