"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $11500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit off on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  This would give you a good price and still let me get a fair deal.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make a deal!",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $11250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident this is the right price for us to agree on.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11250 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $10850. This is a fair price for both of us and closer to where I can comfortably afford it. Let's work together to find a solution.",10850.0,Bob,6,
