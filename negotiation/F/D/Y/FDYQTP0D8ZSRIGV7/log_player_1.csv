{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a significant discount:**  It's lower than the product's worth to Bob, making it attractive.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still $3,000 of potential profit for Bob to bargain for.
* **Maximizes potential profit:**  It's above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response.  If he rejects it, you can either lower the price slightly or hold firm and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $12,000 you initially offered.  There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get closer to your target price.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11,250?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise.
* **Is still above your minimum:** It's more than the $8,000 you could get from John.
* **Leaves room for a possible final deal:**  You're hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the original value of the product to me is $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to your ideal price and significantly higher than what you could get from John.  It's a good deal for you, and it seems like Bob is firm on his price.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
