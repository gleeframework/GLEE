"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $17,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my budget. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $14,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
