"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close! I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make at least $11,500 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to go up to $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
