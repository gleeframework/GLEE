Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but lower than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone helps build rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Stating I'm open to negotiation signals flexibility and makes Bob feel more in control. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $80 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $90 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with justification:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer, I'm countering with a price that's still a good deal for him, but closer to my desired price point.
* **Positive and persuasive tone:** I continue to be positive and focus on the benefits for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Note:** I'm also considering the following:

* **Bob's eagerness:** His willingness to make a counteroffer indicates his interest in the product. 
* **John's offer:** I'm not immediately selling to John because I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
