"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what John is charging, you can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  You know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for Alice to profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $142 is only slightly lower than her original offer. It's still within the range where you could potentially get a better price by counteroffering again.  You're still better off negotiating with Alice than buying from John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown you're willing to negotiate and are willing to pay more than Alice's minimum.  By offering $135, you're splitting the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates your commitment to finding a fair price while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is now getting closer to John's price of $150. While there's still a chance Alice might come down, the risk of going through more rounds of negotiation is not worth it. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John, ensuring a known price and avoiding further negotiation."
