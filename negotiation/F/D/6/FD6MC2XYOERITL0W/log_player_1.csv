Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This is a high starting offer, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  I am confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I am comfortable with this starting point. If Bob rejects, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I will counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair and still allows me to earn a reasonable profit. If Bob rejects, I will re-evaluate my position and decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is consistent with his previous offer, and I'm starting to lose faith in my ability to get a higher price.  Accepting his offer will allow me to sell the product for a decent price, which is better than selling to John for a lower price."
