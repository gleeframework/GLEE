Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $950,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This is still a great price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $975,000? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach a more agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm also working to get a fair price for my product. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
