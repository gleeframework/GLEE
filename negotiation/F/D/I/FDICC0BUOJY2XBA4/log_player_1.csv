Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Our goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, knowing we have a guaranteed backup offer from John. 
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The price of $1,100,000 is strategically placed above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below John's offer ($1,200,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision and might make him more inclined to accept before missing out. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
