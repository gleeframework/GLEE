Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're open to discussing a fair price. To start, how about we aim for a price between $100 and $120? Let me know what works best for you."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""price"": 105}"
