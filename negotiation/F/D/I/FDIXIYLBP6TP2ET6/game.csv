"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $750,000 is still a little bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you meet me somewhere around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to meet you at $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
