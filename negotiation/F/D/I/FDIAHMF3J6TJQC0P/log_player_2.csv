"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an introductory price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it presents a great value considering its worth to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In order to accommodate your budget while still ensuring fair pricing, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than the original offer, and significantly lower than John's price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product while still staying within his budget.  There's not much room to negotiate further, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is present."
