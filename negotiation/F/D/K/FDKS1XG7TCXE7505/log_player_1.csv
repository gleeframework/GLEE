Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum price, $120.  Since this is my minimum price, I don't want to leave any room for negotiation right now. I'm confident John will buy it if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price and I'm not comfortable selling it that low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $110. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my minimum price, $105 is a reasonable compromise and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal. It's also better than selling to John for $120 and risking a longer negotiation with Bob."
