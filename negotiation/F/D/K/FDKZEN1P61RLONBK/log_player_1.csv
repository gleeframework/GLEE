**Reasoning:** 

Bob is stubbornly sticking to offers below John's $10,000 offer.  It's clear he's trying to get the best possible deal, even if it means lowballing. At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer in later rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price."
