I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is room for negotiation. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise to show Bob that I am willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
