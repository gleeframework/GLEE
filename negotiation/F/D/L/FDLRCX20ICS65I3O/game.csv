"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. Can you consider that?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $935,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'm willing to go up to $915,000. Can you consider that?",915000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $915,000 is simply not enough for me to sell. It's important for me to get a fair price for this valuable asset.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once again, so my final offer is $925,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I hope we can close the deal now.  If you're not willing to go that high, I will have to move on to other potential buyers.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. Can you reconsider?",910000.0,Bob,8,
