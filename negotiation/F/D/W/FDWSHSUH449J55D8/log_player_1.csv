"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong opening offer significantly higher than both our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the best possible outcome.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains open and invites Bob's perspective, encouraging a collaborative negotiation process.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness and willingness to pay a premium.  It sets a high anchor point for the negotiation, potentially leading to a more favorable final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a substantial amount, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Accepting now would leave a significant sum of potential profit on the table. 

By rejecting and countering, we signal that while we're open to negotiation, we're not willing to settle for a price that's too far below our initial target. This keeps the door open for a more favorable outcome in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, and understand your perspective on the pricing.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your feedback."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We make a significant concession of $150,000 from our initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, we avoid dropping below the $2 million mark, reinforcing the product's high value.
* **Justification:** By linking the adjusted price to the ""product's true value,"" we subtly reiterate our position while acknowledging Bob's concerns.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  This counteroffer encourages Bob to continue engaging in the negotiation, hopefully prompting him to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,000,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $2,000,000 represents a substantial profit of $500,000 over our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Accepting now capitalizes on his momentum and avoids the risk of him withdrawing completely.
* **Time Value:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  Securing a deal now provides certainty and avoids potential delays or the need to settle for John's offer.

While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and the time value of money make accepting this offer the most prudent decision."
