"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking of a slightly higher price point. How about we try $112? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $108. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $111?

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $109. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think $111 is a fair price for this product. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $110? It's just a small step back from our previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
