Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could both benefit from.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to offer Bob the product.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of the surplus value but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair for both of us. This product offers you significant potential gains, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message positions the offer as mutually beneficial. It emphasizes the product's value to Bob and doesn't dwell on negotiation tactics.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with $150,000 above your minimum and gives Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value. This is a strong starting point for negotiation.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price.  You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'd rather take John's guaranteed offer."
