"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is of interest to me, but $800,000 is a bit high for what I had in mind.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also being more in line with your initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking to negotiate further, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I propose a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also being more in line with your desired price point. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell this product is important to you, and I respect that.  To keep things moving, how about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I propose a counteroffer of $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made.  However, to be honest, $750,000 is the highest I can go. If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'm willing to sell the product to you, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I propose a counteroffer of $775,000. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,9,
