"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and you could potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but it shows you're serious about getting a good deal and are willing to walk away if necessary.  This will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially lead to a compromise closer to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good compromise.  It's still a decent saving compared to John's price, and further negotiation might not yield much more. It's better to secure the product at this price than risk losing it and having to pay John's higher price."
