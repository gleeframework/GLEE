"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a good price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the product's value to me ($1,000,000). I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to gain, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation process, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a deal and ensures I reach my target price. Continuing to negotiate with Bob would only increase the risk of losing the deal altogether, as there is no guarantee he will accept my counteroffers."
