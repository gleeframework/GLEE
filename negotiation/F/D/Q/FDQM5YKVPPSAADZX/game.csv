"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still looking to get closer to $1400000 for the product. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to the value you've identified. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also prepared to explore other options if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
