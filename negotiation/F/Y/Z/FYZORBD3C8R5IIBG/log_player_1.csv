"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm testing the waters with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. If he rejects, I'll adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $18,000 is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from my initial offer, but still staying above Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while signaling that I still believe the product is worth more than $18,000.  I'm hoping this will lead to a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little lower than I'd hoped, it's getting close to my desired profit.  I don't want to risk losing too much time and potentially ending up with the lower price from John.  Plus, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round.  It's time to close the deal."
