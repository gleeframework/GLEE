"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $8,500. It's a good compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
