"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product to you is $800000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the value of the product to you is $800000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
