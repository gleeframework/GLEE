"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $950,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll recognize the opportunity it presents.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for this product.  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $800,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better price.  Rejecting allows me to counter and try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $925,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $912,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $912,500 is now above my minimum threshold of $800,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I've already had two counteroffers and we're getting closer to a deal.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or even a failed deal."
