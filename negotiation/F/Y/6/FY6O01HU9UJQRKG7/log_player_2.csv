"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer allows him to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $8,800 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8800}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. However, it's not so low that Alice is likely to immediately reject it.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  There's still space for both parties to meet in the middle, which will help keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept it. I would like to counter with a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $9,000 represents a $1,000 savings compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer again, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer provides a good compromise and secures the product at a reasonable price."
