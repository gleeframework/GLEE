"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price of $1,200,000 as possible, but I also want to keep the negotiation open for now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm only willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, his initial counteroffer isn't good enough. I will counter with a higher price and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still well below my asking price but reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1050000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay. I'm prepared to offer $1000000, which is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or force me to sell to John.  Accepting this offer is the best strategy to ensure a deal and secure a significant profit."
