"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While negotiating with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, his final offer of $12,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. It's not worth the risk of Bob not budging and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale.  It's better to secure the $15,000 from John."
