"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
