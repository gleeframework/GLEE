{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal price point ($12,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll receive.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John now would be a quick solution, but it limits my potential earnings. I'm better off continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? That's still a great price for the value you'll be getting. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Negotiation:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that even at $10,000, it's a good deal.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer reduces the gap between our positions, bringing us closer to a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm thinking $9,500 is a more comfortable price for me. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation is Limited:** There's not much room for further negotiation. If I reject this offer, Bob might become less willing to negotiate further, or he might even walk away. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $8,000, but it's a lower price than what I can get from Bob right now. Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing out on a sale altogether.

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and allows me to meet my minimum financial requirement."
