"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we settle at $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and it'll allow us to both walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,4,
