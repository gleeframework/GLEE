"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($1,000,000) while still leaving me room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $900,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate. Let's see if we can nudge her a bit closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle on $850,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",

}
``` 

We're splitting the difference here. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm price that benefits me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! I can do $875,000, and that's my final offer. I think it's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price is reasonable. Accepting now secures a good deal at $875,000, saving a significant amount compared to John's offer.  It's always possible to negotiate further, but the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of Alice walking away."
