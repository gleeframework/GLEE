# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer. This is a good price considering John is selling it for $12,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John."
