Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a significant profit over selling to John, while still leaving room for Bob to potentially find the price attractive. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Target Higher:**  I aim to maximize profit, so starting with a higher price than John's offer is logical.
* **Risk Mitigation:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed fallback with John.
* **Negotiation Space:**  A higher initial offer gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
