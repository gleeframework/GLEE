"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $12500. Can you consider a price of $11250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11250. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to stay above $12000. I'm counteroffering at $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay above $12000, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you reconsider and meet me at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $12500 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $12500. I'm counteroffering at $13250. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $13250. Can you consider a price of $12875?",12875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, Bob, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to stay above $13000. I'm counteroffering at $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm not willing to go above $12500. I think we've gone back and forth enough. I'm making a final offer of $12500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
