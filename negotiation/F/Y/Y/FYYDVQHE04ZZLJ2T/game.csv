"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $150 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $140? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this unique item.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $135?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we settle at $145? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this unique item.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus or warranty to sweeten the deal, but the price is firm at $140.",140.0,Alice,9,
