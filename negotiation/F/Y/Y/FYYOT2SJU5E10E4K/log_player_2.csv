"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. If you're interested, let me know, and we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 for the product.  Alice is offering it at exactly that price.  Since you can buy it from John for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer means you'll still get the product and it doesn't cost you more."
