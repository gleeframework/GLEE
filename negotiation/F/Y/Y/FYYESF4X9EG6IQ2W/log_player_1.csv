Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to bargain and still reach a price that is profitable for you. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $180, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it makes a counteroffer closer to $120 seem more appealing to him.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $180, especially if he perceives the product's value to be higher than his initial assessment. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your minimum price is $120, so aim for the best possible outcome while remaining flexible."
