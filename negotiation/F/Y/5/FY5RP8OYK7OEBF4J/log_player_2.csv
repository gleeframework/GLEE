# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and it's a price I'm happy to accept.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, saving you $100,000."
