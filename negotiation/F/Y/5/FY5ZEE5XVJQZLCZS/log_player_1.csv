Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's valuable to you, so I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn an extra $1,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate a price he feels comfortable with, should he want to haggle a bit.
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a price closer to your desired amount.

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between securing a good deal with Bob and ensuring you don't miss out on a guaranteed sale to John."
