{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's price, aiming to establish a starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer is within my budget and reflects my desire to secure a good deal.  I anticipate Alice will likely counter with a higher price, but this is a starting point to see if we can find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise while staying within my budget.  This counteroffer is a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to lower her price, it's still above my budget.  I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that we might not reach a deal that works for both of us. It's in my best interest to secure the product from John at the pre-agreed price of $15,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further potential delays or complications with Alice."
