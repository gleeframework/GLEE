"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $12,000. It's a one-time opportunity to get a product that's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is less than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Bob saves money:** By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $3,000 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer to maximize his savings."
