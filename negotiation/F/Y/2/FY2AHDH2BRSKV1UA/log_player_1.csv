Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you a buffer in case Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It's not too aggressive and might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on how close it is to my minimum price. I'll also be prepared to use John as leverage if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I get a fair return on the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll also be mindful of John's offer of $150 as a backup option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $100 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I remind Bob that even at $110, he's still getting a good deal.
* **Maintain Minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum price of $150, protecting my interests. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive to Bob, but I'm also ready to consider his next move. I'll be keeping John's offer of $150 in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $95? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I get a fair return on the product.  I've already made several concessions and don't want to risk going further below my minimum.  

Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
