"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $100 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
