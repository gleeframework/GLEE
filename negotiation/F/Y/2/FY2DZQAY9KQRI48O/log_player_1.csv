"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your offer, the product's intrinsic value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,262,500. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,262,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a price that's favorable for him. While $1,262,500 is a good profit, I believe I can still negotiate for a better price within the remaining rounds.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so I'm not ready to settle for John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the true value of the product.  I'm hopeful we can close this deal today."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm firm on the price. This could prompt Bob to accept the offer or propose a counteroffer closer to my desired range. At this stage, it's a calculated risk to push for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000. This represents a significant step towards your offer, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While I initially aimed for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is a solid deal. It's significantly higher than my guaranteed offer from John and keeps a good profit margin. Accepting now eliminates the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds or me misjudging the negotiation, leading to a less favorable outcome."
