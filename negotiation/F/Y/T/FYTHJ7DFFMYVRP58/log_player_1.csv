Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Given the potential benefits, I feel this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible from Bob.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still staying significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept a higher price.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John if Bob rejects the offer, so there's little risk in aiming high."
