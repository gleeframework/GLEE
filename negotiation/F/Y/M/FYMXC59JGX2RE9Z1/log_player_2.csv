"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a lower price, potentially saving a significant amount. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  This product is definitely interesting, but I'm looking to spend closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and it's only $100,000 more than Bob's initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with and avoids further negotiation."
