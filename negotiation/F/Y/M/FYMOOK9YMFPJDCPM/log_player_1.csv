Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but I'm only willing to spend a fraction of your initial offer.  How about $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I can do $7,000,  and I think that's a fair offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $15,000?  That's a significant reduction on my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for the value this product provides."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget. I can stretch to $7,500.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

It's clear Bob is unwilling to meet a price point that reflects the product's value to me. I've already lowered my price significantly, and he's barely budging. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on."
