,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $160.  Let's split the difference and make this happen.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $145.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $145 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $152.50?  It's a good compromise and lets us both get a good deal.",152.5,Alice,5,
