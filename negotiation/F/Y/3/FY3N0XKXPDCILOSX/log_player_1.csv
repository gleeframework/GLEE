Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,800,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer price, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room for Bob to come up further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,700,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently increasing his offers, but we're getting close to John's offer, and we still have negotiating room. It's worth risking another round to see if Bob will come up significantly."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I can see we're getting closer to a deal.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, let's make it $1,825,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,725,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we still have room above John's offer, Bob's increases are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,725,000 secures a significant profit above our guaranteed sale to John, and further haggling risks losing the deal altogether."
