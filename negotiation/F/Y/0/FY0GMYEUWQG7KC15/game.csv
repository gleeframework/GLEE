Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
