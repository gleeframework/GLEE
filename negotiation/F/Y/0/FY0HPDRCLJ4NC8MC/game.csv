"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiations. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the effort, but I am still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $15000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can sell the product to you for $17000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this works for you!",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I've already discounted the price significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17000 and $16000, which is $16500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if this works for you!",16500.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer to you. I can sell the product to you for $16500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",16500.0,Alice,9,
