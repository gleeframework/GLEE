"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,200. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",8200.0,Bob,4,
