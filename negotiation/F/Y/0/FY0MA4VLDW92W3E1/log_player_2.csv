Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your budget considerations, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the inherent worth of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price point represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal.

Round 4

To be honest, anything much above $1,000,000 is going to be a non-starter for me.  I'm willing to offer you $900,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand your position, but the value of this product is genuinely much higher than what you're proposing.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I hear that this is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, as I mentioned before, anything significantly over $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me.  If you're willing to come down to $1,000,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
