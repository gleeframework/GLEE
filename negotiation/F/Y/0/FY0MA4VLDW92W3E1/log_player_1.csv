Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still much higher than I can justify.  To be honest, anything much above $1,000,000 is going to be a non-starter for me.  I'm willing to offer you $900,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I hear that this is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, as I mentioned before, anything significantly over $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me.  If you're willing to come down to $1,000,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.

Explanation:

While Bob is now willing to pay his maximum perceived value for the product, it's clear he won't budge beyond $1,000,000. Accepting this offer means a $200,000 loss compared to selling to John.  

At this point, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. It's more profitable to cut the losses and sell to John at the guaranteed price."
