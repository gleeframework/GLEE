"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $80 for this item. Would you consider adjusting the price accordingly?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget constraint, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $120 is still above my preferred price point, I appreciate the compromise. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further to $95? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit below my target. I can offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While $110 is closer to my preferred price, I'm still not able to meet at that point. I propose an offer of $100 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you're offering. Thank you for your understanding.",100.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I've done some research and found that the market value for this product is around $100. I would like to make a final offer of $105. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and the product's true value.",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you've done your research, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $130. This is my absolute minimum, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make the sale.",130.0,Alice,9,
