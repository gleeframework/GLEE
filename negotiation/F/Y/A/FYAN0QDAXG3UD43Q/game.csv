"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to purchase it for a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $775,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,
