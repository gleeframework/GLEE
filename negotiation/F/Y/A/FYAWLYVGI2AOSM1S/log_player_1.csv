{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that's a good compromise between my minimum value and Bob's perceived value.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10750.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my limit and still allows you to make a profit.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm not confident we'll reach an agreeable price in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing out on John's guaranteed $15,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
