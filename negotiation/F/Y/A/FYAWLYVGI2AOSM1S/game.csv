"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11250?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10750.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my limit and still allows you to make a profit.  Let's make this deal happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
