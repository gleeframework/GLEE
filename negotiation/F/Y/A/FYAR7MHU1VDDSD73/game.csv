"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to take it for $140. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $150. I'm willing to meet you at $152.50. It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",152.5,Alice,5,
