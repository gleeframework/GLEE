"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit pricey at $1,250,000, and I'd like to negotiate a better deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value to you.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a significant benefit to you, and a good deal for me.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
