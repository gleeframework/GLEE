"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below the middle ground, aiming to leave some room for negotiation while still getting a decent profit.  I'm also highlighting the value for Bob to increase the likelihood of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $92.50. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we settle on $88?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original target, Bob's offer of $88 is a good compromise. It's more than I'd get from John, and it avoids further negotiation."
