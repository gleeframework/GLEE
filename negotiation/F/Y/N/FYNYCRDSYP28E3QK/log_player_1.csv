Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $500 discount from his perceived value, while you still earn a profit of $1,500 over your minimum. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is clear and concise, focusing on the value proposition for Bob."
