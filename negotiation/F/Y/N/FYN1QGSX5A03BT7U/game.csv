"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value you've described. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $1,100,000. My final offer is $1,175,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
