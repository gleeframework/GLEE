"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, I'll offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above that.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. I'm glad we're on the same page about the product's value. In light of that, I'd like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your revised offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. I'll consider your suggestion carefully. To keep the negotiation moving forward, I'd like to propose a price of $92 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but lower than your last proposal. Please let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",92.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $87, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad we're trying to find a middle ground. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to offer the product to you for $90. This is slightly above your last proposal and below my initial offer. I hope this aligns better with your budget.",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $87. I'm willing to make one final offer: $87. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take the product. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",87.0,Bob,8,
