"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $950,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiation, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $975,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions, and we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've made a significant compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $985,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",985000.0,Bob,6,
