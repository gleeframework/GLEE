"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $950,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiation, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $975,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe we can get Bob closer to $1,000,000 with a few more rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you've made a significant compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $985,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could try to push for more, Bob is unlikely to go over $985,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
