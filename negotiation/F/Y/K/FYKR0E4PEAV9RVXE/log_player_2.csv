Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",

}
```

Let's start the negotiation low to understand Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from our ideal price. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  How about we meet halfway between our offers at $75?"",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit above your target price, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting close to our maximum price, and we're running the risk of her walking away if we push too hard. It's better to secure a good deal now at $85 than risk losing it."
