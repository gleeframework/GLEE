Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 by continuing the negotiation."

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting too close to John's offer.  It's not worth risking losing the deal entirely by trying to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars. I'll accept John's offer and secure a sale.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a significant profit."
