Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is higher than $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $110 is above your minimum price of $120, leaving you room to lower the price if needed.

This approach allows you to potentially get a good price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $95 for the product. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120 and my initial offer of $110.  I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I really can't go above $95 for the product. Would you consider coming down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum of $120 and allows me to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $120.  It's better to secure a sale now and move on."
