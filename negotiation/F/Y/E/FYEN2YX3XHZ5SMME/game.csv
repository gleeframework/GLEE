"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still finding it a little steep. How about $775,000? That's a significant move on my end.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a significant move, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm counteroffering at $812,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your efforts to reach a deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to move up to $790,000.  I'm hoping we can close this gap and get a deal done.",790000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to move up, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and that's $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,7,
