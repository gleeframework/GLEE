"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and functionality, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you might be around $80, I propose we find a fair middle ground. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to my perceived value than her initial asking price, it's still significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I know I can get the product for $80 from John, so rejecting this offer and going with my alternative option makes the most financial sense."
