Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need at least $12,000, as that's what John will pay.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price in the middle, hoping to get a good deal while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good price. 

This strategy gives me a chance to make more than my minimum while still being competitive enough for Bob to consider accepting the offer."
