"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than you're asking. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,800,000  is below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This offer reflects a more agreeable middle ground, don't you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think the product is worth less than you're asking. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for it. I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to find a mutually agreeable price.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
