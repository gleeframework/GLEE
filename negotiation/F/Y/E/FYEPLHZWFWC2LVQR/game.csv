"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob, I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I'll offer you the product for $1400000, but this is my final offer.
