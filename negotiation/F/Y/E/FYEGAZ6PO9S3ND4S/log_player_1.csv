Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're going to be stuck in a loop here.  I'm willing to go down to $107 one last time. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to sell the product to someone else."", ""product_price"": 107}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  However, we're running out of time, and I'm worried that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, or I might have to sell to John for a lower price.  I think accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
