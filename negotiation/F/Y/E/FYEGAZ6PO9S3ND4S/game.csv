"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $105?,105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $105 is still a little low for me. How about we compromise at $108? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $108 is the best price for me. Would you be willing to consider $105 again?,105.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're going to be stuck in a loop here.  I'm willing to go down to $107 one last time. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to sell the product to someone else.",107.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $107. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 again?",105.0,Bob,8,
