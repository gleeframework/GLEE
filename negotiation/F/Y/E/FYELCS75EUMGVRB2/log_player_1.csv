"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing potential profit.  I'm also framing it positively to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with more negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop the price to $98. This is a fair compromise, and it's a great price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$92 is still below my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing that we're not quite on the same page yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. It's a fair price for the value you'll receive from the product, and it allows me to stay above my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for a while, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure if I can get him to meet my desired price. It's better to be safe than sorry, and John is offering a guaranteed $120.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
