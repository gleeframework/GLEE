"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a round number that might be easier for Bob to accept. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging to make the negotiation more positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I will try to counter-offer Bob and see if we can meet in the middle. I still have 8 rounds to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, which would be $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more. While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price yet. I still have 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $112, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $112 is close to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go any lower than $113. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 113}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $113 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $110, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer of $110 is still too low.  With only 2 rounds left, I don't have enough time to negotiate any higher.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
