"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly enhance your endeavors or personal collection. After careful consideration, I propose to offer this exceptional product to you at a special price of $1,200,000. This is a generous offer that allows you to secure such a valuable asset at a fraction of its true market value. I trust that you will find this proposal compelling and look forward to your positive response. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am here to assist you every step of the way. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:** Her message claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, but that's your absolute maximum price. She's likely inflating the value to justify her high offer. 
* **You have a backup plan:** John offers the product for $1,500,000. While not ideal, it's your safety net if you can't get a better deal from Alice.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. She might be willing to lower it to avoid losing the sale."
