"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a fair price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $600,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $950,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Could we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $725,000 is cutting it a bit too close. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This recognizes the value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
