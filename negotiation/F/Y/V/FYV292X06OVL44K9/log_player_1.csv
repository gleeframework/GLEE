Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""true worth,"" I am subtly suggesting that his perceived value might be undervaluing the product.
* **Alternative:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed offer from John, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below both my minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a significant loss. It's clear we have a wide gap to bridge, but his offer suggests room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to his perceived value while still leaving room for me to profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a fair price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $600,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $950,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I've significantly reduced my asking price to get closer to Bob's range, but I'm still aiming for a price above his perceived value.
* **Justification:**  I'm using softer language like ""reasonable compromise"" to appear more flexible but stand firm that his initial offer was too low.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps me well above my minimum while encouraging Bob to move closer to the $800,000 mark he deems valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Could we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards his perceived value of $800,000, but his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for anything below a certain threshold.  It's time to inch closer to my minimum while gauging his willingness to move further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $725,000 is cutting it a bit too close. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This recognizes the value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** By stating that $725,000 is ""cutting it too close,"" I'm setting a firm boundary without completely shutting down the negotiation. 
* **Compromise with Strength:** Offering $850,000 keeps me above my $800,000 target while suggesting a willingness to move.  
* **Final Push:**  This counter-offer might be my last before I accept John's offer. It hinges on whether Bob is willing to meet closer to my range."
