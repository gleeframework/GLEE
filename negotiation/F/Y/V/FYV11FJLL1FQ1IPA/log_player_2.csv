Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He's still within his budget and can likely push for a lower price."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice has lowered her price significantly, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  John is offering the product at a price Bob is comfortable with, and further negotiation with Alice may not yield a better result."
