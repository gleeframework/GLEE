"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I want to continue negotiating and see if I can get the price down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you're placing on this product, but $1,350,000 is still above what I'm prepared to spend right now.  Let's compromise at $1,325,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $1,325,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,337,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,337,500 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's a reasonable price considering the value of the product and my desire to save as much money as possible. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and the price could increase again.  It's more strategic to accept her offer and avoid further potential losses."
