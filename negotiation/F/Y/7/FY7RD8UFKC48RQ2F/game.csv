,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. However, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle again, say around $80? That feels like a fair price.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but $100 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $85 and we have a deal?",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $85, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer the product for $92.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",92.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, how about $87.50?",87.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $87.50, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product for $95. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,9,
