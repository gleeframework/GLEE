"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further and potentially save an additional $100,000. You can always switch to John if the negotiations don't go your way."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,075,000. This is a great deal for you, and I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down a bit, but her counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still higher than what John is offering.  It's worth pushing for a lower price to see if we can get closer to our target.  We can always switch to John if things don't work out."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a price that's a bit lower.  I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. This is a great compromise, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product at this price. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still $50,000 above what John is offering.  There's a good chance that further negotiation with Alice will get us closer to the $1,000,000 price, but there's also a chance that she'll hold firm.  To avoid the risk of wasting more time, it's best to secure the product from John at a guaranteed lower price."
