"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14000, which is a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $14,000 is less than $15,000.
* **You're still within your budget:**  $14,000 is below your maximum price of $15,000.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
