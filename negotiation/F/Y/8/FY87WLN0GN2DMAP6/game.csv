"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its worth to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
