Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500.  I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes Alice knows Bob's $12,000 valuation. In a real negotiation, this information is often hidden.
* Bob might try to negotiate the price down. Alice needs to decide her lowest acceptable price beforehand."
