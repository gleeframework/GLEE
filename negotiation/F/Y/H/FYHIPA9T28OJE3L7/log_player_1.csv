"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for something worth a lot more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Alice, hoping to make Bob more interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below Alice's minimum. There's potential to get closer to Alice's desired price, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $9,500? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value to you, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is getting closer to Alice's desired price, it's still below her minimum.  There are still rounds left, and she can potentially get closer to her desired price of $12,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $9,400? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'm willing to go up to $9,300, but no higher. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,300 is a tempting offer, it's still below Alice's minimum desired price. There are only 4 rounds left, and Alice should try to push for a higher price. She can still potentially reach a better deal with Bob, or she can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. How about we split the difference at $9,350?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still want to try to make a deal. I'll meet you halfway between $9,300 and $9,350, which is $9,325. That's my final offer. Can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,325. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,325
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,325 is getting closer to Alice's desired price, there's not enough time to push for a higher offer.  With only 2 rounds remaining, and the risk of Bob rejecting Alice's next offer, it's wiser to secure the deal with John at $12,000.  Alice can't afford to gamble with time when she has a guaranteed deal at her minimum desired price."
