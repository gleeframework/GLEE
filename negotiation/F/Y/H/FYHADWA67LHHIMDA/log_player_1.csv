"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is above my minimum threshold, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? This would still be a great value for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Could we meet at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has remained firm at $130. While I would prefer a higher price, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, potentially forcing me to sell to John at a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's above my minimum threshold."
