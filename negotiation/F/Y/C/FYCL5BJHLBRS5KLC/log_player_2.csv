"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. Let's settle at $1,090,000.  This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a significant concession from her previous offers, Bob can still try to negotiate further. It's worth risking a rejection to potentially secure a price closer to his target.  If Alice rejects, he can then buy from John at $1,000,000."
