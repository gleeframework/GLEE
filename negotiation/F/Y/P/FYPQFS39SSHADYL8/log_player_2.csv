You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $10,000. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, you're still aiming for a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $12,000 and there's still some room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer lets you try to get closer to your desired price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  How about $9,500? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be worth it to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

Alice is back to her original offer of $10,000. This is a good deal for you, as you're willing to pay up to $12,000. You've successfully negotiated a lower price and saved yourself $2,000.  There's no guarantee you can get a lower price in the next round, so accepting her offer is the best move here."
