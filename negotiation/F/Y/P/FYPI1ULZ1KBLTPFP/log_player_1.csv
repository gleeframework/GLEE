Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit out of my budget at that price. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $700,000 is below my minimum threshold. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 850000}

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
