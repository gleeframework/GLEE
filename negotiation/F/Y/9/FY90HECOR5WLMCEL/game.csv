"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget limit, however, $80 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. Could you stretch to $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. While $130 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $100? That's the absolute highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
