Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its worth"" Alice subtly implies the product's value is high, making the offered price seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is not demanding, but rather inviting for Bob's input (""What do you think?""), making it more likely he'll counter-offer rather than just reject outright.

**Important Note:** Alice has a strong fallback position with John willing to pay $12,000. This allows her to be more assertive in her initial offer to Bob."
