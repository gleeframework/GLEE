"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Would you like to make an offer on the product for $15000?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a limited budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we consider $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I believe we're getting closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution. Could we consider $11500 for the product?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11500. I think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal and both come out happy.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $13250, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal and both come out happy. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,9,
