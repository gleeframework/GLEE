"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with an offer of $15000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.**  There's no immediate incentive to accept.
* **You want to see if you can get a lower price.**  Rejecting the offer lets you explore other options.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic counteroffer:**  A 20% reduction is significant but not unreasonable. It shows you're serious about buying but are looking for a better deal.
* **Clear and concise messaging:**  Expresses your interest and provides a justification for your offer. 
* **Setting the stage for further negotiation:**  Leaves room for Alice to counter, allowing the process to continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $12000 is a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $13500. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction, but not enough.** $13,500 is still above your preferred price point, and you have room to negotiate further.
* **You want to see if you can push for a lower price.** Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John's offer remains your safety net.** You can always buy from him if the negotiation with Alice falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  A smaller reduction of $500 shows you're taking Alice's offer seriously while still pushing for a better price.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message emphasizes that the price is fair for both parties, making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Maintain momentum:**  The counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
