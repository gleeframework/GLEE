"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $12000 is a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $13500. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13500 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $13000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",13000.0,Bob,4,
