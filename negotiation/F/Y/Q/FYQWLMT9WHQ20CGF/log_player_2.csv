"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $15,000, and Alice's minimum selling price is $12,000. This means there's room for negotiation to find a price that benefits both parties.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can counteroffer at a lower price, potentially reaching a price closer to his goal of saving as much money as possible. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk that Alice might reject Bob's counteroffer, the potential reward of getting the product at a lower price outweighs the risk. 

**Next Steps:**

Bob should now make a counteroffer to Alice. A good starting point would be somewhere between $12,000 and $14,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's closer to his initial counteroffer, it's still above his desired price point.  He can continue negotiating and see if he can get a better price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate. Alice's rejection of his counteroffer indicates that she is willing to compromise.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's price, there's still a $1,000 difference. There's a good chance that Bob can further reduce the price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding Overpaying:**  Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer would still result in him paying more than he wants.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer again, ideally closer to $13,500,  to continue pushing for a price that's closer to his target."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000. Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer is Unacceptable:**  Alice's offer of $15,000 is exactly Bob's maximum willingness to pay. There is no benefit to continuing negotiation with Alice. 
* **No Further Savings:** Any counteroffer Bob makes is likely to be rejected by Alice, as she's already at her maximum price.
* **Avoiding Further Delays:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice would only delay Bob's purchase and potentially lead to further frustration without any guarantee of a lower price.

**Conclusion:**

By purchasing from John, Bob can secure the product at his maximum price point and avoid any further time-consuming negotiations with Alice."
