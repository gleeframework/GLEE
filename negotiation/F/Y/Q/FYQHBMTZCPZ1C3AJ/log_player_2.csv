"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to enhance your daily life or work experience. Given its unique features and benefits, I believe it's worth more than just its price tag. Considering its value, I propose a special introductory offer of $100 for you. This is an exclusive opportunity to experience the product before anyone else. Would you like to take advantage of this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product, and John is also offering it for $100, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open in case you find a better deal later."
