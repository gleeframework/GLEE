Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would you consider adjusting the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell to him at this point. There are still 8 rounds left. I want to see if I can get a higher price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I really like the product, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we meet halfway at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it.  It's only $5 more than John's offer, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $100. We still have 6 rounds left, so there's time to see if we can negotiate a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  How about $88? It's a fair price that's closer to your budget and allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 88}
