Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it could be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $150.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to get a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product ""could be very valuable"" to Bob, you subtly reinforce its worth, potentially making him more willing to pay a higher price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Phrases like ""I think"" and ""What do you think?"" make the offer seem less aggressive and more open to discussion.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's a good chance he'll counter with a price higher than $120, giving you the opportunity to still make a profit above your guaranteed sale to John."
