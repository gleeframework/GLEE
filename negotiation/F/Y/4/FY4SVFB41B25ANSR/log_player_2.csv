"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. You don't know the product's value to Alice, so there's potential for a better deal.  By rejecting, you can start a negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by significantly lowering the price. This aggressive approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate:** If she immediately rejects this offer, it suggests she values the product highly and is less likely to budge.
* **Establish a lower starting point:** A lower starting point gives you more room to maneuver during the negotiation.
* **Encourage Alice to counter-offer:** By providing a clear price point, you encourage Alice to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her offer of $700,000 is closer to your initial counteroffer.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to your desired target. You can use the information gained from Alice's counteroffer to inform your next move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  By increasing your offer slightly, you signal your willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a favorable price. It also provides Alice with a clear price point to consider in her next response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $690,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $650,000.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk is that Alice could reject your counteroffer and you might end up buying from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer provides a good deal while minimizing the risk of a worse outcome."
