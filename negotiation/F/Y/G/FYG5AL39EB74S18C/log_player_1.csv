Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a better deal if he pushes back.
* **Understanding Value:** We know the product is worth significantly more to Bob than your minimum price. Aiming high allows you to capture some of that perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate down, while still keeping the price well above your fallback offer from John. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during the negotiation process, but stand firm on not going below your minimum of $800,000."
