"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price still reflects the product's worth, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,175,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob can likely negotiate further and get the price down even more.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for more potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which reflects the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and takes into account the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's already made several counteroffers and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but not enough for Bob. At this point, it's clear that Alice is not going to budge much further.  Rather than continue negotiating, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees a purchase within his budget and saves him $225,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
