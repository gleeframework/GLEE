,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers immense potential for a return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part and reflects the true value I place on it. ",750000.0,Bob,4,
