"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,175,000. This would allow you to make a significant profit while still giving me a good deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
