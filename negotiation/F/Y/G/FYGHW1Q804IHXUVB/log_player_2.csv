"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

While $1,250,000 is a better price than John's, Bob can still aim for a lower price.  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to his ideal price."
