"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to me, and you'll be getting a good price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 4

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $101. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I'm not losing money. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk the negotiation failing with Alice."
