"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, we'll see how he counteroffers and go from there. It's important to keep John in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a good price. I'm keeping in mind that John is waiting to buy at $800,000 if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting closer to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then having to sell to John for a lower price.  $860,000 is a good compromise and secures a decent profit."
