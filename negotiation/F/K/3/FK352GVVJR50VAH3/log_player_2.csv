"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? That's still a fair price for the value of the product, and it's closer to what I'm hoping for. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  $13,250 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's a significant drop from the initial $14,000. 
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.**  Bob doesn't know if Alice will budge further. If Alice rejects another counteroffer, the price could go back up to $14,000 or even higher.
* **John's price is a safety net.**  Bob knows he can always buy from John for $15,000, so accepting Alice's offer guarantees a lower price and avoids further risk."
