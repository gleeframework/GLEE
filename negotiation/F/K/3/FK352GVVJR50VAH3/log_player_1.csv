Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:**  This is a starting point that is above my minimum value of $12,000 and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Leave room for negotiation:** By starting at $14,000, I allow for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately hitting my floor price.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  While I'm aiming for the best possible price, it's crucial to keep in mind that Bob's value for the product is $15,000. A starting point of $14,000 gives us both space to negotiate. 
* **Keep John as an option:** By starting at $14,000, I'm not risking a rejection that would immediately force me to sell to John at the lower price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $12,500 is a bit higher than my floor price of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Maximize potential profit:** I want to try to get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  
* **Keep John as a fallback:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $12,000. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price between $12,500 and $14,000, trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? That's still a fair price for the value of the product, and it's closer to what I'm hoping for. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that the price is still fair. 
* **Maintain room for negotiation:**  While this is a move towards Bob's offer, it still allows for a potential counteroffer from him, keeping the negotiation open.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding common ground:** Splitting the difference is a common negotiation tactic that often leads to a faster agreement.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** This counteroffer allows me to get closer to my desired price while still maintaining a possibility of selling to Bob. If he rejects, I can fall back on John's offer.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
