"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  You have room to go lower than $900,000, and Alice likely wants to sell the product."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice is coming down in price. Keep negotiating! You have room to go lower than $850,000, and Alice likely wants to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to make a deal at $800,000.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's likely Alice is holding firm at $825,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she will reject your offer and you'll have to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $175,000 compared to buying from John."
