"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle at $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my limits.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
