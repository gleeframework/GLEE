{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value of $8,000, but still allows for some wiggle room for negotiations and leaves open the option to sell to John for $10,000 if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both something to work with."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit out of my budget. How about $7000? I think that's a fair price considering I'm willing to buy the product from John for $8000 if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired target. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my $10,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,750? This would be a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $7750 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold. I don't want to risk further negotiation, as it might result in even lower offers.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000 to ensure I achieve my target price."
