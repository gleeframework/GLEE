"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation if necessary.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a decent price for me.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair offer, considering his own valuation of the product, and that he'll be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer more, it's better than selling to John for $80.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
