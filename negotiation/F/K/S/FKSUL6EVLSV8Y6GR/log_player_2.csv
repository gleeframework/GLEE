"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  $120 is too high for you, and you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you want to save as much money as possible, you should aim for a price as close as possible to your perceived value of the product. You know Alice is willing to sell for $80, and you are willing to pay up to $150.  A counteroffer of $100 gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being a significant discount for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, but you are still aiming to save as much as possible. You know that Alice is willing to sell for less than $110, and you have already shown that you're willing to pay $100. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown you're willing to pay $100, and Alice has lowered her price to $110. A counteroffer of $105 shows you're serious about buying but are still aiming for a good deal. This is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, making it more likely she'll accept."
