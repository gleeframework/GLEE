"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above the product's worth to her ($800,000). 
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John. This gives you room to try to get a better deal. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This still allows you to make a good profit while giving me a price within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. This gives you a significant advantage and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is better than her previous offer, but it's still higher than the price you're comfortable with.
* You have 7 more rounds to negotiate, which gives you leverage.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer again and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I can offer $925,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move closer to a deal. Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a great compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now closer to your counteroffer and getting closer to the price you're willing to pay.
* You have 5 rounds remaining, but the difference between her offer and your last counteroffer is only $15,000. 
* It's likely that you can continue negotiating and potentially get a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal or needing to buy from John at a much higher price is increasing.
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation risks."
