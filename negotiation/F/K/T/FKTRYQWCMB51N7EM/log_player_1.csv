Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,000,000 if I'm patient and negotiate strategically."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer and would like to counter with $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting very close to my minimum goal of $1,000,000 and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for the same amount."
