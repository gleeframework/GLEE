Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:** This ensures I'm still getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  A $1,500 gap allows for some give-and-take.

This is a strategic approach to maximize my chances of getting a good price while keeping the negotiation open.  I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects my offer, and I'll always have John as a backup if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that doesn't reflect the value of the product.

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap, but I'll be prepared to sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial price. How about $12,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and his. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I've reminded Bob of the product's worth to him, subtly reinforcing the value of the deal at this price.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $12,000 is still above my $15,000 minimum, but it's getting closer to Bob's price. This keeps the negotiation moving. 

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between maximizing my profits and keeping the negotiation open. I'm prepared to move further down if necessary, but I'm confident this price is fair and appealing to Bob."
