Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of $120 because it is below my minimum price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $165?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $140 is still below my minimum price of $150. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. How about we meet in the middle at $155?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $155 is a bit high. Would you be willing to go down to $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum price, and I've only got 4 rounds left.  It's better to guarantee a sale for my minimum price than risk another rejection and potentially end up with a lower price or no sale at all."
