"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even cheaper. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, a counteroffer of $60 is a good starting point. This shows you're serious about buying but are also willing to negotiate. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer.  $65 is still a good deal, and you're running out of time.  It's likely that further negotiation will only get you a few dollars lower, and it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely."
