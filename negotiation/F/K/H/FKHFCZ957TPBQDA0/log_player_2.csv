# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm confident this product will bring you immense value exceeding that amount. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Alice's counteroffer is $1,350,000, which is still within your budget and closer to your desired price of $1,300,000. Accepting this offer saves you money compared to buying from John and allows you to avoid further negotiations."
