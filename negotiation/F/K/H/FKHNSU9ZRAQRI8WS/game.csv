"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit at that price. The product holds significant value to me, and I believe a price closer to $750000 would be more fair for both of us.  This price still allows you a good profit, while making the purchase more appealing to me. Let's continue this negotiation and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still looking to maximize my profit from this sale. I'm willing to offer you a price of $725000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to you and the profit I'm looking to make. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",725000.0,Alice,3,
