"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me while still leaving you with a good profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
