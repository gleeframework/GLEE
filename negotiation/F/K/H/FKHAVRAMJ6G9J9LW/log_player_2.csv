"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above my maximum price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is way beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than my true maximum ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Justification:** I provided a reason for my low offer (""beyond my budget"") without revealing my true valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and suggests I'm willing to have a discussion to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, $12,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I need to show her I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't come down further. It's time to inch my offer upwards a bit, but stay well below my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $8,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** I'm being more direct now, stating clearly that $12,000 is still too high.
* **My Maximum Price:** I'm now offering my true maximum of $8,000. There's no point holding back any longer, as I'm willing to walk away and buy from John.
* **Justification:** Adding in a mention of the ""current market"" is a negotiation tactic to make my offer seem more reasonable, even though I don't have specific market data. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By putting my best offer forward, I'm subtly creating a sense of urgency for Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but I'm not going to budge from my $8,000 offer. It's time to hold firm and see if she's willing to come down further. I'm happy to walk away at this point and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I've carefully considered my budget, and $8,000 is truly the most I can spend on this. It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price. If you're not able to meet that, I understand, but I may need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Polite but Firm:** I'm reiterating my position and making it clear that $8,000 is my final offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm implying that I've done my research and that my offer is justified.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm reminding Alice that I have the alternative of buying from John.  
* **Call to Action:** I'm ending with a clear call to action, urging her to accept my offer and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you halfway between $10,500 and $8,000, which is $9,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go down to my $8,000 limit. It's unlikely she'll budge further from her ""final offer"" of $9,250.  Rather than wasting more time negotiating, I'm going to take John's offer and secure the product at my target price."
