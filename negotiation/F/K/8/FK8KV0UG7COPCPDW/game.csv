"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and it's a good price for me as well.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,500?  It's a win-win for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
