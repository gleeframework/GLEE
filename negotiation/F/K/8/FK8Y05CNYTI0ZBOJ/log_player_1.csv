Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to leave room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price of $100.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand it's a bit lower than my asking price, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  I'm sure you'll agree that this product is still a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and since I can sell to John for the same amount, it's a good deal for me. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal without further negotiation."
