Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to start with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This is a common negotiation tactic to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. It's also possible he may be willing to pay more than $80, but I don't want to start too low and leave money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for a low price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $90. This is another compromise, but I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for a low price."
