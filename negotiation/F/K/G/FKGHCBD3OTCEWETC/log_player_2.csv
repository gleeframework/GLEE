"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to the product's true value, Bob can likely get it for even less.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on this product. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. While Alice is showing flexibility, $9,000 is still a bit too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before potentially going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much, and Bob has already made several counteroffers.  While $9,250 is a good deal compared to the product's true value, it's still above Bob's ideal price. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price reductions.  Since John offers the product for $8,000, it's in Bob's best interest to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
