Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that gives you a significant portion of that potential profit, while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 risks immediate rejection, while offering a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value. 
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 secures you a $350,000 profit, a significant gain from your minimum.
* **Why it Works:**  This price gives Bob a compelling reason to buy â€“ he's still saving $150,000 from his perceived value.

**Important Note:**  This is just one offer strategy.  You could start higher and be prepared to negotiate down slightly. A lot depends on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
