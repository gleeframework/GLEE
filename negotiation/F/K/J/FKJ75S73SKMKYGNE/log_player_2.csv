"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I propose a price of $140. This is a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better price. Since you are willing to pay $120, it makes sense to try and negotiate further. You have 10 rounds, so there is plenty of time to explore better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. While I'm interested, $140 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering the value you place on the product and your budget, how about we aim for $135? This is a bit higher than your offer, but still below my initial asking price. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You're willing to pay $125 and John is offering the product for $120, so you have a clear target price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue bargaining for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $130.  This feels like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
