"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I propose a price of $140. This is a great opportunity for both of us.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. While I'm interested, $140 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering the value you place on the product and your budget, how about we aim for $135? This is a bit higher than your offer, but still below my initial asking price. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $130.  This feels like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
