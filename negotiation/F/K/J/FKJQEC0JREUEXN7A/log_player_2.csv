It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product for less than $100."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your limit of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88.50. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal and offer $90. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice is offering $90, which is still above your maximum budget of $80.  You've tried negotiating, but it seems Alice isn't going to budge much further.  It's better to buy from John for $80 to ensure you stay within your budget."
