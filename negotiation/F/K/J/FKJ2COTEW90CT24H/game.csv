,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also taking into account your concerns. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1600000, which would be $1700000. This price still reflects the product's value, while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000, but I'm willing to go up to $1650000. Can we meet somewhere in between?",1625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1625000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to $1675000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1675000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",1650000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close to the final stretch. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to $1675000 is too high, but I'm willing to meet you at $1650000 is a bit low, so I'll meet you halfway between $1650000 and $1675000 which is $1662500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1662500.0,Alice,9,
