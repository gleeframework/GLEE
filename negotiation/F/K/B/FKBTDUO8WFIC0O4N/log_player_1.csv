Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it's worth significantly more to you than it is to me. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, making it more enticing. 
* **Alternative Option:** We know we have a fallback option with John at $800,000, so we can be a bit bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
