{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable addition to your collection. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's value of $10,000, giving him some room to negotiate.  It also leaves room for me to potentially go lower if necessary, but it's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget for this purchase is strictly under $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for that low of a price just yet.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a bit of wiggle room.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,200. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I will make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial situation, but $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $10,400 for this to work. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10400} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my financial situation, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am unable to meet you at $10,400. My final offer is $10,300. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm confident that I can sell it to John for a better price.  It's time to move on and secure a deal that's more beneficial to me."
