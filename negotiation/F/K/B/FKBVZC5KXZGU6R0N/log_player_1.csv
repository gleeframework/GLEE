Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is interested but doesn't want to pay that much. I also know I can always fall back to John's offer if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Bob to accept.  I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to drop too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is now offering $1,100,000, which is more than John's offer and a good profit for me.  There's no guarantee that we'll reach a higher price in future rounds, so I'm going to take this deal."
