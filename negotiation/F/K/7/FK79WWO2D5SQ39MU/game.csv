"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from its worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay a price closer to the product's actual value to you. I'd like to propose a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it would give us a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with a price of $900000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering a price of $1200000. This price still represents a significant discount from the product's value to you, but it's closer to its worth to me.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a significant amount for me and represents a fair profit for you. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering a price of $1200000 is too high for you, but I'm willing to go to $1150000. This price is still a good deal for both of us and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
