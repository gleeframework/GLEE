"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know if this works for you.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,250 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  How about $10,000? This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
