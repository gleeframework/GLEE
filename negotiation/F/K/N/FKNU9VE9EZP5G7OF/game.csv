"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,000. This is a great deal, as it's already $2,000 below the market value of $12,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is still a bit below my target price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum and your minimum. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
