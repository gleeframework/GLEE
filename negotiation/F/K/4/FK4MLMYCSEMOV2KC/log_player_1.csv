"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point to see how interested Bob is and gauge his potential buying range.  I'm leaving myself room to negotiate down if needed, but still aiming for a profit well above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting his offer will allow me to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  The risk of selling to John for $10,000 is still present, but I'm hoping for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $11,000.  It's getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's above my minimum.  This is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer again and try to push for a higher price in the next round. Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm making a final push with my counteroffer at $10,500. This is only $500 above John's offer, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting really close, but I'm out of time. With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a higher offer from Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's time to cut my losses."
