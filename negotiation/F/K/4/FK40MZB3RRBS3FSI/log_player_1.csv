Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit of $200,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can start negotiating down.  However, I'm keeping John as a backup option in case the negotiations stall or go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still below my target. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,150,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is closer to my target price and a good profit.  Further negotiation might get me a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal altogether with Bob and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain."
