Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,120,000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are still early in the negotiation. While Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is a decent increase, I believe I can still get him closer to $1,100,000.  It's time to show I'm willing to negotiate but also stand firm on the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close the gap. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you're getting."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1,090,000.  This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a sale without sacrificing too much. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly committed to purchasing the product and is willing to negotiate. While I could push for a slightly higher price, the difference is relatively small at this point. Accepting $1,090,000 guarantees a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
