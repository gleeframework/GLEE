"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth you'll gain from it.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,120,000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close the gap. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you're getting.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1,090,000.  This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a sale without sacrificing too much.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
