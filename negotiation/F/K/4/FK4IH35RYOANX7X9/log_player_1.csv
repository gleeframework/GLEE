"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, so I'll make a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
