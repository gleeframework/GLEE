"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $9500 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I'm really interested in the product and believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks again, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you consider $8750? I'm really close to my budget, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price at this point.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8800.0,Alice,5,
