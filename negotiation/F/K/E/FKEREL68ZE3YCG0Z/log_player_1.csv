Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,500,000?** I'm aiming for a profit, but I also need to balance that with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  $1,500,000 is a significant markup over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, giving me a good potential return. However, it's not so high that it makes Bob extremely unlikely to accept.
* **The Risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer for $1,000,000. This means I have room to negotiate and potentially increase the price.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay a higher price.  I'm setting a high bar, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
