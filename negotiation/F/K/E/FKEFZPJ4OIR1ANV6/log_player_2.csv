"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still a bit too high for him, and he has more negotiating room.  He should counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate. $11,500 is still too high, and he has more room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. Let's split the difference and see if $11,000 works for you. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay $8,000. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. Can we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer. $11,250 is a fair price that is still within his budget and a good deal for him.  He's already been pushing for a lower price, and Alice is hinting that she might have another buyer.  It's time to close the deal and save more than he would with John."
