"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can do better than $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $9,500, which is a good price for you since the product is worth $12,000 to you.  It is still a good deal even though you could potentially negotiate even lower.  However, there is a risk that Alice will reject your next offer, and then you may have to buy from John.  Accepting the offer guarantees you the product at a good price."
