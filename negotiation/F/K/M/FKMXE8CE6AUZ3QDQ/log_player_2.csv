Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $16000. Is that something you'd be interested in?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll give you a slight discount, so I'm offering the product to you for $15500. This is my final offer on this price point, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is above your budget, and although she claims it's her final offer, there's no guarantee she won't lower it further in the future.  Since you have a reliable alternative with John offering the product for $15,000, it's best to cut your losses and buy from John.  You've saved $500 compared to Alice's offer."
