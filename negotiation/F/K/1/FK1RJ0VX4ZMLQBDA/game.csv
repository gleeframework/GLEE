"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking of offering $90 for the product. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding your budget constraints. While I would love to accommodate you, I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. However, I am willing to extend a special deal just for you. How about we agree on $110 for the product? This is still above the market average but significantly lower than the initial offer. I hope this meets your budget requirements while still providing you with a high-quality product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but I need to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. If not, I may need to explore other options.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budgetary concerns and am willing to work towards a mutually beneficial solution. Considering your offer and my desire to maintain a fair price, how about we agree on $95 for the product? This is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the quality and value of our product while staying within your budget. I hope this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but I really need to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a price of $82? I'm willing to make one final compromise to meet you halfway. If not, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John for $80.",82.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price for our product. Considering your latest offer and aiming for a compromise, how about we agree on $88 for the product? This is slightly above your proposed price but still below the initial offer, reflecting the quality and value of our product. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows you to enjoy the benefits of our product without exceeding your budget.",88.0,Alice,7,
