"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and my original offer of $10,500. How about we try $10,750? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",10750.0,Bob,4,
