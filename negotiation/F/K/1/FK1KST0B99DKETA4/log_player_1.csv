"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping I can get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
