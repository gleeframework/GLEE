Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct and highlights the value of the product without revealing your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. You can always negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
