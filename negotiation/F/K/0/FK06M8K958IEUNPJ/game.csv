"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and it ensures I can make a fair profit. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,420,000? That's a bit lower than your last offer, but it's still a good price for me.",1420000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there.  $1,450,000 is the lowest I can go.  This is a one-time opportunity for you to get your hands on a truly valuable product. Let's make this happen.  What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
