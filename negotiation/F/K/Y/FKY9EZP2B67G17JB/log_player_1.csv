Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $125 gives Bob a potential bargain while still leaving room for profit above Alice's minimum price.
* **Creating Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time"" adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly and not miss out on what seems like a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly lower price. 

This strategy aims to maximize the chances of a sale to Bob at a price beneficial to Alice, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
