"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd sell to John, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm confident that if Bob rejects, we can reach a mutually acceptable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to reach a higher price, as I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it is a fair offer considering Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're running out of rounds. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the deal with Bob doesn't materialize."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,450,000. This is a considerable concession on my part, but I'm hoping it will convince Bob to accept.  I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and we only have five rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  With only four rounds left, I'm not confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, and it's the safest choice at this point."
