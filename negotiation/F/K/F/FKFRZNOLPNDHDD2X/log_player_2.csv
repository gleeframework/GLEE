"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to push for a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer gives you another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $90 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50.  I'm really keen on getting this product and think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
