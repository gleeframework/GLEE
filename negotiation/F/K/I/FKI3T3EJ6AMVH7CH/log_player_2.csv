"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, but Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is closer to Alice's minimum value, which is $800,000. Offering $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  However, it's still better than buying from John.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price closer to his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer, but still keeping it below his initial target price.  This offer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal, but also signals that Bob is determined to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, and while it's a good deal compared to John, Bob is still determined to get a better price. It's likely that Alice will continue to offer lower prices since she's unwilling to sell at Bob's counteroffer. Bob has a good chance of getting a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing his willingness to meet Alice halfway.  Since Alice is already offering a price closer to his initial counteroffer, it's time to show flexibility.  This offer is still a great deal for Bob compared to John's price, and it could be enough to entice Alice to finally agree to a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000. While Bob could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will reject and start increasing her offer again.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that is still significantly better than buying from John."
