"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $100.  If that's not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to go with another seller.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $140. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. However, $140 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120.  If that's not workable, I'm ready to move on to another seller.",120.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 was still a bit high, and I appreciate your final offer of $120. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,9,
