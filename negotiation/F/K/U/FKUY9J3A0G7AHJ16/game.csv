"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer of $8,500. I think this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $8,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to you.",7000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $7,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to offer $6,800, which is still a good compromise. I think this price reflects the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the purchase.",6800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,400 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $6,900. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",6900.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,600.
