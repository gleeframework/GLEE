"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, so I'm going to reject his offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my budget limit. I can offer $120, but that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of a further price drop and reaching a point where I'm forced to accept a less desirable price is too high. It's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150, ensuring I at least meet my minimum acceptable price."
