"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy from John. While Alice is willing to come down to $13,500, this is still higher than John's price of $12,000.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice when he can secure the product for a lower price from John."
