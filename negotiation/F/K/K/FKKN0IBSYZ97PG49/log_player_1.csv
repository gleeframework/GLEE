Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is a price that's still higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly inviting Bob to respond, indicating that I'm open to further discussion.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I have John's $15,000 offer as a safety net, so I can be firm in my negotiations with Bob.
* **Potential Counteroffers:** Bob might counter with a lower price. I'll need to assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or accepting his counteroffer, depending on how close it is to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than my desired price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's message indicates he's willing to negotiate further.  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a safety net with John's offer, so I can afford to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $14,000.  I will need to be strategic, considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and my desire to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize that my price is justified.
* **Closing the Deal:** I use language like ""meet in the middle"" and ""close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm still relying on John's $15,000 offer as a safety net, so I can afford to be firm but also flexible.
* **Bob's Response:**  I anticipate Bob might counter with a price closer to $13,000, and I'll need to assess whether to accept or make another counteroffer."
