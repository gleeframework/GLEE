"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for you as it's significantly below its market value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

The price is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy it from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed while staying well below our maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still closer to John's price. We should push for a better deal before considering Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair offer considering current market conditions."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer matches John's price. It gives Alice a final chance to meet our desired price point while still potentially saving us some money."
