"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $10,500. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  How about $9,500?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'd like to add a small premium for the convenience of a quick sale. I'll counteroffer at $10,250. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",10250.0,Alice,5,
