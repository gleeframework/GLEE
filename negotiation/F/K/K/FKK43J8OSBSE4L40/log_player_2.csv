# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $10,000 since it's worth $8,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $10,500. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  Bob can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  How about $9,500?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'd like to add a small premium for the convenience of a quick sale. I'll counteroffer at $10,250. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been negotiating for a while, and Alice is now offering $10,250, which is still more than Bob's target price.  At this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate with Alice will be time-consuming and potentially lead to a higher price.  Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees a quick purchase, even though it's higher than Bob's ideal price.  It's a compromise between saving money and getting the product efficiently."
