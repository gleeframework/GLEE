"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm interested in the product,  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider a price of $8500? I believe this is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
