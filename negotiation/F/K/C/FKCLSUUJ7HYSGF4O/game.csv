"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $200 is already a significant discount on my end. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $120, which is a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
