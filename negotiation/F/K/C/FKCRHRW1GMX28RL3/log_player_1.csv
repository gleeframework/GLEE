{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport and then sets a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This will allow for room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $110 is a decent price, it's below my minimum value.  I will reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product! While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $112. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but it's still below it.  I'm confident I can get a better price with John, so I'll sell to him."
