# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above my budget. It's closer, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price. It's worth another round to see if we can find a compromise closer to my $1,200,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. How about $1,525,000? This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,525,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely we're going to be stuck in a stalemate. It's better to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John.  I'm happy to pay $1,200,000, which is within my budget and ensures a successful purchase."
