"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
