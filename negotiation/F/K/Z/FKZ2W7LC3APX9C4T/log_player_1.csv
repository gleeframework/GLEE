Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum price. Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a much higher profit than selling to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is slightly below Bob's perceived value but comfortably above your minimum. This creates a win-win scenario where Bob gets a good deal, and you maximize your profit. 
* **Open Communication:** The message invites Bob to discuss the offer, fostering a collaborative tone and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counter-offers. You have some leeway to go down, but remember your minimum price and the value John offers."
