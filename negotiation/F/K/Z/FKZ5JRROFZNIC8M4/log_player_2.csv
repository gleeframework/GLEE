"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $9,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible while still getting the product.  He's starting with a significant counteroffer, below Alice's offer but still within his budget. This strategy allows for negotiation space and shows his seriousness in acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  He's aiming for $8,000 or less. Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to go up to $8,200 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's try to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his target price of $8,000. He's only $200 away and shows a willingness to compromise, making this a reasonable counteroffer that might tempt Alice to accept."
