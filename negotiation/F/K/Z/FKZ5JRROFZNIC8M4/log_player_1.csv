"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I want to try to get a better price from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to go up to $8,200 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's try to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd like to get a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's best to accept his offer and secure the sale."
