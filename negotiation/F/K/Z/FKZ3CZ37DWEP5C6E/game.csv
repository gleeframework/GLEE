"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
