Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know John will buy the product for $100 as a last resort, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $150 allows room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the price too high. 
* **Not Too High:**  While I want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high might make Bob immediately lose interest without even trying to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a good profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
