Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept $890,000, but this is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to apply pressure and set a firm boundary.  By stating this is our final offer, we signal seriousness and push Bob to make a decision. We are still above our minimum and leave little room for him to counter with a significantly lower offer."
