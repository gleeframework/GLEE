"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product, which I believe is worth a significant amount to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1000000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000, but I need to be sure it aligns with my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, almost 25% lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also sets a strong starting point.
* The message is friendly and acknowledges the value of the product, while emphasizing my budget constraints. 
* We have 10 rounds, so it's not essential to close immediately. This counteroffer gives Alice room to consider and allows for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000 to make this deal work.  I'm confident that this product will generate significant value for you in the long run. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for my comfort. While she moved from $1,000,000 to $900,000, there's still room to negotiate.  I want to see if we can come closer to my initial counteroffer of $750,000.  We have plenty of rounds remaining, so I'm not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  $900,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my last offer ($750,000) and Alice's latest ($900,000). This shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate my belief in the product's value to demonstrate genuine interest.
* **Budget Constraint:**  I maintain the focus on my budget limitations to justify my price point.
* **Open-Ended Question:** ""What do you say?"" encourages Alice to respond and continue the negotiation."
