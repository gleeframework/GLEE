"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can we meet in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This would ensure a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your offer, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle once again and settle on $800,000. This price would allow us both to walk away happy and satisfied.",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",795000.0,Bob,6,
