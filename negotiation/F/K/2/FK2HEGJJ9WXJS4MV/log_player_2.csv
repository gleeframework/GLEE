Explanation:
Alice is offering the product for $950,000. While this is less than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob signals to Alice that the price is too high. Alice, eager to sell, might come back with a lower offer closer to her own valuation.  Even if Alice doesn't budge much, Bob always has the safety net of buying from John for $1,200,000.
