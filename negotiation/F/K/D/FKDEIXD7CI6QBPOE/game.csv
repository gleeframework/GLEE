,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a great opportunity for you, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
