"Alice, thank you for your generous offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties and allows me to secure the product within my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, considering the value this product holds for you.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.

"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway,  $950000 still falls short of what I need to consider this a worthwhile deal. However, to show you my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and gives me a fair return.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement, but unfortunately, $975000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.

This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it allows us to bridge the gap and finalize the sale.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
