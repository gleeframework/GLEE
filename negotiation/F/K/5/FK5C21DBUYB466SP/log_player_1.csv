This offer starts with a high price, allowing room for negotiation.  It also includes a positive message that emphasizes the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

While $14,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on a price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  Since John is willing to buy the product for $15,000, it's better for me to sell it to him.  Negotiating further with Bob may risk losing John as a buyer, and I don't want to jeopardize a guaranteed sale."
