"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a steal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a high price establishes a strong starting point and allows for more negotiation room.
* **Justify the Price:**  Mentioning the ""value"" of the product without revealing specifics keeps Bob intrigued and allows for him to potentially justify the price in his own mind. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with a question invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and encourages a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can counteroffer. It's worth exploring if I can reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm hopeful that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, potentially exceeding John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $1,600,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforce value:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth and encourages him to consider the long-term benefits. 
* **Show flexibility:** ""Meet in the middle"" emphasizes a willingness to negotiate further, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1600000, so how about $1400000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I don't reach an agreement with Bob, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, guaranteeing my minimum. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I still have 6 rounds remaining. It's worth seeing if I can squeeze a higher price from Bob, especially with John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000 as a final compromise. This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I've reached my minimum acceptable price and clearly state this is my ""final compromise."" This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider accepting.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to remind Bob of its worth and justify my price.
* **Close the Deal:** I use phrases like ""close this deal"" and ""make this happen"" to push Bob towards making a decision and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $1,400,000, which is still below my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further delays and the possibility of a lower final price. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 without further negotiation or risk.

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the potential for further negotiation that might result in a lower price."
