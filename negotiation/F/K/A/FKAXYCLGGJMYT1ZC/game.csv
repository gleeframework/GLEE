"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $95 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $80, which would be $90. Can you consider that price?",90.0,Bob,4,
