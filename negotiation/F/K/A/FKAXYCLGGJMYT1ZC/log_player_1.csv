Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $95 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $80, which would be $90. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $90 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and allows me to avoid the risk of him walking away completely.  Additionally, selling to John for $120 would require me to abandon the current negotiation, potentially missing out on a future opportunity to increase the price.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy in this situation."
