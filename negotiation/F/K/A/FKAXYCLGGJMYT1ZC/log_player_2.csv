"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $95 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm not willing to pay $95, but I'm still interested in buying the product. I'll try to negotiate further.
