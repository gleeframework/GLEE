"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the value, my initial offer reflects the true potential of this product, which goes beyond its immediate worth to you.  Considering its unique aspects, I could meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This offer represents a significant investment from both of us, but I believe the returns will be mutually beneficial.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
