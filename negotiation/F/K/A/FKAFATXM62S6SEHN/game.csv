"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8200. It's a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, based on my budget, I am unable to go above $8000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.",8000.0,Bob,4,
