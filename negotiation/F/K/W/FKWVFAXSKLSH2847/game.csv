"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll see the value in this deal and be willing to move forward.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and very close to your last offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
