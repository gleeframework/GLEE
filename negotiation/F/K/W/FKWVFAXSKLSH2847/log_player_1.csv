Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and very close to your last offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
