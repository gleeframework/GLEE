"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, while still ensuring I make a profit significantly above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value. While it's tempting to accept it and get a deal done, I'm going to hold out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's low offer with $12,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is now above my minimum value and getting closer to what I would like.  While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option at this point.  It's risky to continue negotiating, as we are getting close to the end of rounds, and I could end up losing out on this deal altogether."
