"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it, what do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit too high for my budget, though. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but I think I can still get it lower. I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $77 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $81.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both close to an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly anchoring to her value, and we're unlikely to get a much better deal. $81 is a good price and saves me a significant amount compared to John's offer."
