"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still out of my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500.  It's the most I can reasonably afford, and I hope we can find a way to make this work.",8500.0,Bob,4,
