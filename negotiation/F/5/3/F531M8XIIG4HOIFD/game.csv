"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is too high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, but $800,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to accept $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
