"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? It's a fair price that benefits us both.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair starting point for us both.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget has some limitations.  Would you consider $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
