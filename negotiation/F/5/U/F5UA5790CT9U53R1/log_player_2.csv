"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $1,300,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's product is worth $1,200,000 to her.  Bob is offering $1,100,000, which is still a decent profit for Alice.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal than $1,280,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer.  He should aim for a price closer to $1,200,000, which would still be profitable for Alice.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is not a good option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,220,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is still a bit high for Bob. He's already shown his willingness to negotiate, and this counteroffer at $1,220,000 is a reasonable compromise. It gives Alice a good profit margin while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount compared to John's price or Alice's previous offer. It's a strong proposition that could potentially close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is now very close to Bob's desired price point.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price is significant.  Accepting this offer provides a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
