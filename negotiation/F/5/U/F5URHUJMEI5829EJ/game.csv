"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,015,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
