Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's a starting point for negotiation.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down to a price that works for me."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, but I'm not going to pay more than that. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. Hopefully, this will be closer to a price we can both agree on."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still too high. At this point, it's better to go with John's offer of $1,500,000. I've tried to negotiate with Alice, but it's clear she's not willing to come down to a price that I'm comfortable with. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
