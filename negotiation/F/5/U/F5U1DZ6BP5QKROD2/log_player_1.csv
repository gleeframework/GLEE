I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I can't accept a price that undervalues my product. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves a comfortable margin above my minimum value. I believe this is a fair price that could entice Bob while still ensuring I get a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to a price I'm willing to accept, it's still not enough.  I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a compromise that will allow us to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.  I believe this price is fair and could be attractive to Bob while still providing me with a reasonable profit."
