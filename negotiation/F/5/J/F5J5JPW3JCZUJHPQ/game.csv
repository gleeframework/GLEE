"Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product in your hands.  I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This price reflects a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us both. Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1,100,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it still provides you with a valuable opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about $950,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 as a final compromise. This offer reflects a significant reduction from my initial asking price, but it's still crucial for me to cover my costs. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away. How about $925,000? That's the absolute highest I'm willing to go.",925000.0,Bob,6,
