Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  However, I also know I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to sell at a price that's below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still higher than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my minimum value and a good compromise. It's a better deal than selling to John for $12,000, and it avoids further negotiation."
