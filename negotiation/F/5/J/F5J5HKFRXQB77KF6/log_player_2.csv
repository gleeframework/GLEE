"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is good but I'm looking to save even more.  How about $12,000?  It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering your value of $15,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, it's a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for $1,000 less than John's price and $1,000 more than his initial counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price."
