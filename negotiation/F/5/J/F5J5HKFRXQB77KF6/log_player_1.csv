Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn more.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing the value Bob gets helps him see it as a good deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've earned a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh it against the potential $10,000 offer from John. I'll aim to negotiate a price closer to my desired $14,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is good but I'm looking to save even more.  How about $12,000?  It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my desired price:** While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my target of $14,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to reach a better price. I can counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation with Bob for a potentially higher price.

**Next Step:**

* I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original $14,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering your value of $15,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $13,000 is still significantly above the $10,000 I could get from John, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating.
* **Emphasizing Benefits:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he's getting and framing it as a win-win situation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to consider if his next counteroffer is worth pursuing or if I should accept John's offer and end the negotiation."
