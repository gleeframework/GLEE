"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe my initial price is a more accurate reflection of its potential.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still much higher than what I had in mind. I can go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I recognize we have a significant gap to bridge.  I'm confident this product can generate substantial returns for you, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my belief in the product's potential for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a big jump for me.  If you're truly serious about finding a compromise, I could go up to $1,000,000 even. However, that's my absolute maximum, and I won't be able to go any higher.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
