Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his maximum offer of $1,000,000. While this is a substantial sum, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000 and John's standing offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge this gap. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the product's full value."
