"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the value you place on the product is $12,000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a better price with her, potentially closer to her value of $10,000. If she doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can still buy from John."
