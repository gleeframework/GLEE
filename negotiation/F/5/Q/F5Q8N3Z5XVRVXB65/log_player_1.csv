Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there is room for him to counter without you feeling pressured to accept a lower price. 
* **It shows confidence:**  A strong initial offer shows you believe in the value of your product.

Remember, this is just the beginning of the negotiation. Be prepared to counter Bob's offers and be flexible, but always keep your minimum acceptable price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I can only consider a price up to $1350000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,350,000 is still a profitable sale, it's significantly lower than the $1,400,000 you initially offered.  Rejecting allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You've shown you're not desperate to sell at any price. This strengthens your position in the negotiation.
* **Explore a higher price:**  You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, potentially securing a better deal.

**Next steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price closer to your initial $1,400,000. This could be $1,380,000 or $1,375,000. Be prepared to negotiate further if needed, but don't let Bob push you too far below your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,375,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meet in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,350,000. 
* **Maintain value:** While you're compromising, the price still reflects the product's worth and remains higher than your minimum.
* **Show flexibility:**  This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Remember, the goal is to achieve the highest possible price. While it might be tempting to accept Bob's offer, you're showing him that you're willing to hold your ground and negotiate."
