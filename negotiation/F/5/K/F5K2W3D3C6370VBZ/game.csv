"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'd like to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's capabilities, and it's still within a reasonable range for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's capabilities, but I still think $1200000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1000000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
