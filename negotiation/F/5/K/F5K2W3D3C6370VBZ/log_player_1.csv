Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly above my minimum ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him think about its worth to him.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage a response and start the negotiation process. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point.  The actual price I choose and the way I approach the negotiation will depend on factors like:
    * How much I think the product is worth to Bob
    * How confident I am in selling to John as a backup 
    * How eager I am to make a deal with Bob.
* I'll need to carefully consider Bob's counteroffers and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'd like to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is interested in the product, and I can likely get a higher price by countering his offer.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, I prefer to negotiate with Bob if possible and try to secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, perhaps $1,200,000,  emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's capabilities, and it's still within a reasonable range for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Addressing Bob's concerns:** I acknowledge Bob's budget and reiterate the value of the product to him. 
* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Emphasizing value and benefits:** I again focus on the potential benefits for Bob's business. 
* **Open to finding a solution:**  I end with a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's capabilities, but I still think $1200000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1000000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go lower than this.
* **No further negotiation needed:** There's no point in rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation.  He's already met my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get a better price.
* **Selling to John offers no advantage:** Selling to John for the same price as Bob's offer doesn't gain me any additional profit.

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It allows me to sell the product for my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiations that may not result in a higher price."
