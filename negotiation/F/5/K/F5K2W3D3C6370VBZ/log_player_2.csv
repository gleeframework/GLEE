Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's capabilities, and it's still within a reasonable range for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
