"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer doesn't change anything for you.  It's a neutral decision, but it keeps the possibility open for Alice to potentially offer a better price later."
