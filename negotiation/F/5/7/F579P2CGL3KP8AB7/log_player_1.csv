{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer sets a price point that is significantly better than John's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also opens the communication with a friendly approach, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still lower than the price I'd like to get. I'll counter with a lower price than my original offer, but still higher than Bob's, to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise, and while it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's significantly better than John's offer and worth closing the deal."
