"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice in the first round.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob might be able to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $130 is a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to do $125? "", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob is still trying to get the best price possible.  While $135 is closer to his target, he can likely still get a lower price.  He should reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we try $132? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob has already rejected a $130 offer, so it is reasonable to assume that Alice is likely to hold firm at $132.  At this point, accepting the $132 offer is the best option.  Buying from John for $150 would be more expensive, and there's no guarantee that Bob will be able to get a better price from Alice in the remaining rounds."
