Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for at least $80, so starting at $95 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $100, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a clear message:** The offer is concise and states the price upfront.

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:**  While $85 is only $5 above your minimum of $80, you have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.
* **You have leverage:** You can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't work out. This gives you a safety net. 
* **Potential for higher price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your initial offer of $95. This might lead to a more favorable outcome for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Still profitable:** $90 is well above your minimum of $80, making it a profitable deal.
* **Clear message:** The message is direct, stating the new price and reiterating the value proposition for Bob.

This approach is a strategic move to keep the negotiation moving while maintaining your desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I think we can work something out. Would you consider selling the product for $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $87 is only $7 away from your minimum of $80.
* **Limited upside:** Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher.  Further negotiation might just lead to a stalemate.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject Bob's offer and counter again, he might walk away, leaving you with only John's offer of $80.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision. It secures a sale at a price that's close to your minimum and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely."
