"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a fair offer considering the product is worth $120 to Bob and at least $100 to me. I hope to close the deal quickly, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110. This is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to my desired price point. I hope to close the deal this round, but I'm open to further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $108 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John. I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
