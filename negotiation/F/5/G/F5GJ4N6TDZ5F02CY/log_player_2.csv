**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He has a maximum budget of $120, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start pushing for a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within his budget. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while also signaling his intention to acquire the product."
