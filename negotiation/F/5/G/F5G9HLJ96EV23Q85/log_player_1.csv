Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000.  This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit.  I believe this price is appealing enough to Bob while also giving me a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to stay above my minimum.  I will counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000, and it's closer to my minimum value of $15,000. I believe this counteroffer shows my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value for the product. Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price, I'm better off selling the product to him. This ensures I get the best possible outcome for myself."
