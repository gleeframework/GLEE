Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob.  

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can gradually lower your price, but never go below your $80 minimum."
