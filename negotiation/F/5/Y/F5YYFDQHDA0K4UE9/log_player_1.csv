{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects my initial offer.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, which might make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I could accept his offer and still make a profit, I'd be leaving a lot of money on the table.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 
 
I've lowered my price slightly, but I'm still significantly above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to come up a bit more, while still leaving me with a good profit. I'm also maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference and say $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, and it also puts the pressure on him to accept or come up with a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close.  I can do $1,100,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk wasting more time and potentially ending up with a lower price.  I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
