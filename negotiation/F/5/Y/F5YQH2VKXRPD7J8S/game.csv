"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's try to make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my original offer, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,800. This is a small increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
