"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You are willing to pay $8,000, and Alice is offering $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

You're still looking to save money, and while $10,500 is closer to your budget, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my original offer, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,800. This is a small increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800

```

Alice is now offering $9,800, which is only $200 away from your initial target of $8,000. While it might seem tempting to try to negotiate further, you've already gone through several rounds and Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly. It's likely that continuing to negotiate will lead to more back and forth without a significant price drop. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might not yield a better outcome."
