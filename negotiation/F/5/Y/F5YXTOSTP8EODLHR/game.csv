"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of its value and my financial constraints, I'd be willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  Given the value I place on this product and the price point I'm comfortable with, I'd like to offer $1,100,000.  This would allow us to make a deal while ensuring both of us feel comfortable with the outcome.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
