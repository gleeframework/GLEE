Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's well above my minimum of $8,000 and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm ""open to negotiation"" I signal that I'm willing to compromise, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **Knowing John:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:**  $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still confident I can get more. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better price. 
* **John's Offer:** While $8,000 is my safety net, I believe I can do better with Bob, especially given his interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm looking for something closer to $10,500. This still leaves a good deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $10,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting the Value:** I emphasize the good deal Bob is still getting, hoping to encourage him to agree.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By offering a slightly lower price, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate further, but also demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $9,750 is very close to my minimum target of $9,000.
* **No Guarantee of Improvement:** There's no guarantee that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. Bob might not be willing to budge further.
* **Risk of Loss:** Rejecting the offer risks losing Bob's interest entirely and having to settle for John's lower offer.

While I'd love to get a bit closer to my initial desired price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
