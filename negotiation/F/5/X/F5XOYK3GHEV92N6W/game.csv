"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $11,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but $11,500 is simply too low for me at this stage.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it ensures a successful deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and my original offer of $11,000. Would you consider $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
