"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer is not a good decision. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is always a better option. However, there's a chance that Bob can get a better price from Alice, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer makes sense."
