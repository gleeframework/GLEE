Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a fair compromise, allowing me to get closer to my desired value while giving you a good deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $750,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I also need to ensure I'm compensated fairly. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John for your maximum budget."
