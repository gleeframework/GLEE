Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 leaves a small buffer. If Bob tries to negotiate, Alice can slightly reduce the price while still staying well above her minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to settle for a low price from Bob."
