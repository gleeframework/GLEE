"Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 just doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about $90? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
