"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is significantly lower than what I consider a fair value for the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $15,500? That would still be a great deal for you and allows me to get a reasonable price for the product.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
