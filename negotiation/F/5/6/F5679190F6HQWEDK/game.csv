,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $65 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to go up to $90?  I'm confident you'll find this product a great value at that price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $65 is low, but $90 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $85. This is a great product, and I think you'll find it well worth the investment.",85.0,Alice,5,
