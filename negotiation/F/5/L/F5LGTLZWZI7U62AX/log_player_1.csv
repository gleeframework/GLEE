Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being positive and emphasizing the value of the product. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** Starting high gives me more room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** A friendly and enthusiastic approach encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Provide a clear path forward:** I've made a specific offer, so Bob knows exactly what's being proposed. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try and secure a better price. 

By rejecting the offer, I am signaling to Bob that I am not desperate to sell and that I am confident in the product's value. This could potentially push him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm reducing my price to $9,000, showing flexibility but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm being reasonable and acknowledging Bob's perspective while also highlighting the value of the product. I'm framing the offer as a compromise that benefits both of us. 

This approach aims to:

* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  Reducing my price demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  By not accepting his offer, I am sending a clear signal that I won't sell for less than $9,000. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and collaborative message can help keep the negotiation moving forward. 

This counteroffer aims to create a scenario where Bob feels compelled to increase his offer or risk losing out on a potentially valuable deal."
