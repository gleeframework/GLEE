Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $675,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price of $675,000 is a reasonable deal.  While we might be able to push her a little lower, there's a risk she'll hold firm, and we'll end up with a worse outcome.  It's better to secure a good price now than risk losing the deal."
