"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $600,000. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower.  How about $650,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $675,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",675000.0,Alice,5,
