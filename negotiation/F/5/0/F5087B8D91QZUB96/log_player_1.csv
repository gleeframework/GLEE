"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value ($15,000) than Bob's ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message establishes a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $12,000 leaves room for counteroffers without making me feel like I'm giving away too much too quickly.

**Strategy:** 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I aim to maximize my profit while keeping the option to sell to John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($15,000), it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and there's room for negotiation. I believe I can potentially get a better price.
* **John is a Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm not giving up on getting a better deal, but I'm aware that John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** $11,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm being flexible. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to find ""common ground,"" signaling that I'm still open to further discussion. 

**Strategy:**

By making a reasonable counter-offer and keeping the dialogue open, I hope to reach a price that's acceptable to both of us.  I also keep in mind that John is a backup option if I need to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I can't go above $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** $10,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied.  I want to see if I can push for a bit more. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's ample time to continue negotiating. 
* **John is Always an Option:** The sale to John is still a viable safety net.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt another counter-offer.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than $10,000, especially given my ability to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  I'm still not quite there at $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my last offer ($11,000) and Bob's current offer ($10,000).  This shows a willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" for both of us, subtly reminding Bob that we're both trying to get a good deal. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With 5 rounds left, I'm trying to get closer to a deal without giving away too much. 

**Strategy:**

By proposing a middle ground, I'm hoping to make Bob more likely to accept.  If he rejects again, I'll have to consider my options more carefully, as I'm starting to run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I am comfortable with $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob has remained steadfast at $10,000, showing he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Potential for More:** With 4 rounds left, I'm still within reach of my desired price. There's a chance he could come up a bit more if I reject.
* **John's Value:**  While $10,000 is a decent amount, selling to John for $15,000 is still significantly more profitable.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make one final counter-offer. If that doesn't work, I'll sell to John and secure a much higher price. I'm willing to risk losing a bit of time to see if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I've given this a lot of thought. To be honest, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. But, considering the time we've spent negotiating, I'm willing to meet you at $10,250. This is my final offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my last attempt to get a better price from Bob. I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate further.
* **Slightly Higher:**  I'm increasing my offer by a small amount ($250) to show that I'm still trying to be flexible but also that I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price.
* **Value of Product:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify my offer.  

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes counteroffer. If Bob accepts, I'll secure a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll move on to John and earn a much higher price.  I'm taking a risk, but I believe this is my best shot at maximizing my profit with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your consideration. I would like to counter with $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has remained steadfast at $10,000. It's clear that we've reached an impasse. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds left, the chances of getting a higher offer from Bob are slim. 
* **John's Offer is Attractive:** Selling to John for $15,000 will give me a significantly higher profit compared to $10,000.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure the best deal possible.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can't risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a much better offer from John."
