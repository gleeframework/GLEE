Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer of $800,000, so I'm not in a rush to settle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $900,000.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can still get closer to my target of $1,000,000 or even higher. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to achieve a price closer to my target. I believe this is a fair offer and that Bob will be motivated to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $920,000. While I would have preferred to get closer to my target of $1,000,000,  $920,000 is a good deal and a significant improvement over John's offer of $800,000. It's important to recognize when a deal is good enough and move forward."
