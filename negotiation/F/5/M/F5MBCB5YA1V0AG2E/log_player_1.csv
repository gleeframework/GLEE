I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, as it's likely worth more than $1,000,000 to him. If he rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob's offer implies he values the product significantly. I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still holding out for a higher price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,250,000, which is closer to my desired profit margin.  While I'd like to push for more,  further negotiation risks losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safety net, but I'm willing to take this offer and secure the sale."
