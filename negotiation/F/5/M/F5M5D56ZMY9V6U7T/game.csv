"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? This would still give you a good price, and it would work for me.",130.0,Alice,3,
