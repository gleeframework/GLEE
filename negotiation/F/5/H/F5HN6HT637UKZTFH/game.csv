"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your offer of $1,400,000, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
