"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm definitely interested, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,225,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm confident we can find a sweet spot.  How about $1,200,000?  That's my absolute limit, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,225,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $1,210,000. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",1210000.0,Alice,5,
