Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

This offer is above my minimum of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It's a good starting point to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm going to try and get closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to the value of the product to me.  I believe $11,000 is a fair compromise."
