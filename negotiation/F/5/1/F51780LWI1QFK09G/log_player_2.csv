"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $10,500, which is halfway between Alice's value of $10,000 and his own maximum of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and leaves room for further concessions if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still better than buying from John for $12,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
