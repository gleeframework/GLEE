Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to drive the price down, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $795,000? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us.

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $795,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
