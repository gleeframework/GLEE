Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but still within the realm of reason. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above what I'm willing to pay from John. This demonstrates my seriousness in wanting the product while also showing my willingness to negotiate."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not happy with the price.  Alice is showing some flexibility, but I believe I can push for a lower price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a price closer to my budget. It's a compromise that might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with further negotiation. I'm still within my budget, and I have time on my side."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1060000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was close, but still a bit too high. I'm going to try to split the difference this time, which should be appealing enough for Alice to consider while still keeping me within my budget."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting increasingly close to John's price.  Since I'm only a few thousand dollars away from my maximum, accepting this offer makes sense to avoid the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer or losing the product to John."
