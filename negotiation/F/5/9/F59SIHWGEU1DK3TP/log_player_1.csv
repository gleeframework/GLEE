"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate and gives me the best chance of getting a high price.  I'm also aware that I can always switch to John's offer of $1,500,000 if Bob isn't willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a little low, but it's a starting point. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price. I believe I can get closer to my target price, especially since I can still fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,800,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows flexibility and I'm confident that this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to me. I believe it's high enough to be attractive to Bob, while still leaving room for potential future negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to weigh my options more carefully, but I believe I can get closer to my goal price in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $1,500,000, and even John is willing to offer me more. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  I still have time and options, and I'm confident I can secure a deal that's more beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,600,000. This is still a significant drop from my initial offer but it shows flexibility. I believe it's a fair price, considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done, but I'm also not giving it away. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It seems clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations. With only 4 rounds left, it's not likely I'll be able to secure a deal with Bob that is above my minimum.  I'm better off accepting John's offer of $1,500,000, which is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirement."
