"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point.  While I'm willing to come down a bit more, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $10,150? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but no higher. That's my final offer",9500.0,Bob,6,
