{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This price is lower than my minimum value of $150, which gives me flexibility to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Friendly Approach:** Using a friendly tone and emphasizing the product's value might encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum value and the possibility of selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $135 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $125?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Seeking a higher price:** I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value to see if we can reach a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price that's higher than $125 but still lower than my minimum value. I'll keep the possibility of selling to John in mind if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to $140.  This is a fantastic product, and I think it's worth it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum value ($150) and Bob's offer ($125). This shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a profit.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to see the worth in paying a slightly higher price.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and open tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll need to weigh whether to make a further concession or move on to selling to John. I'm aiming to reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to do $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm very serious about buying the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $130 is still below my minimum value of $150, it's close enough that I'm willing to accept it. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Bob is clearly serious about buying the product and might be willing to go slightly higher in the next round. 
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and I might not reach a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  It's a good price considering the circumstances and my willingness to sell to John for $150."
