Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This gives him a slight discount compared to his own valuation, making it a potentially appealing offer, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done, $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $850,000. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for him to accept while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $800,000. 

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob seems to be stuck at $775,000.  Negotiating further with him risks going back and forth endlessly.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the most secure and sensible choice at this point."
