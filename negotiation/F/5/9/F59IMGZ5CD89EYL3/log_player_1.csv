"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value while still exceeding my minimum. This sets the stage for potential negotiation and allows room for concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's very close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price and there are rounds remaining. I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of the negotiation before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000} 
```

I'm going to counter again, this time slightly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm  trying to find a middle ground and hopefully reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  There are still a few rounds left, so I'm going to see if I can get Bob to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1290000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still a bit higher than my minimum. We're running out of rounds, so I'm trying to close the deal with a price that's reasonable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is now below my minimum.  Given the risk that Bob may not increase his offer further, and considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's more prudent to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure a sale and avoid risking a deal falling through completely."
