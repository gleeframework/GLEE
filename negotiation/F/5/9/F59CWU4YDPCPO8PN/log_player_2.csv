"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my target price. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. This is my final compromise, so let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my target price.  While it's a good move towards my desired price point, I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I think this price is still a good value for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $920,000 is closer to my target price, I still think I can negotiate a better deal. I'm not willing to give up on potentially saving an extra $40,000, so I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $920,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to offer $890,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I think this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay, but we're getting closer. I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal, especially since we still have a few rounds left. I'll reject her offer and see if I can push for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern, but $915,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $912,500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to try to close the deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is still above my target price, but we're getting very close to the end of our negotiation rounds.  It's unlikely I'll get a significantly lower offer from Alice in the final round. Additionally, buying from John for $1,000,000 would be a much worse deal. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible decision at this point."
