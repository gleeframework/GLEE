"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let's find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1300000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which is a significant concession on my part. Let's not forget the unique value of this product. I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
