Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me some leverage.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Expressing value:** I'm mentioning that Bob might appreciate the product. This subtly tries to increase its perceived value in his eyes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I'm willing to accept. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:** I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $100, which gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this deal would be beneficial for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, it still leaves room for potential further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer and potentially getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation with no guarantee of success. 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, securing a guaranteed profit from John is the most logical decision in this scenario."
