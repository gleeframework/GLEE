"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me is $10000. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10800 for the product. I think that's the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10800. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $11200. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $10800 for the product, and that's the highest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $10000.",10800.0,Bob,6,
