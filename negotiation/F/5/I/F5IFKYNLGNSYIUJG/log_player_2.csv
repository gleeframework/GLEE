"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price.  $12,000 is over your budget, and you can always go with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range for me. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further.  I still have some rounds left, so there's room to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is close to my budget, I'm going to try to get it down to $10,000.  I still have some rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm making my final offer of $10,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she rejects, I'll buy the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is only willing to go down to $10,200, which is still above my budget.  I'm running out of rounds, so it's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000."
