"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $700,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $675,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",675000.0,Alice,3,
