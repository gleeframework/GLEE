Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000.  I believe this offer reflects the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering the product at a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) increases the chances of him accepting it outright.
* **Above Alice's Minimum:** The offered price is significantly higher than John's offer ($12,000), ensuring a good profit for Alice even if Bob negotiates down somewhat.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a balance between assertiveness and the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'm looking for in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle between our last two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?"", 
""product_price"": 13250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This approach is often perceived as fair and can help move negotiations forward more smoothly. 
* **Still Profitable:** $13,250 provides a significant profit over selling to John and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit above $13,250. How about we try $13,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $13,000 is a solid profit, exceeding my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) by a comfortable margin.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk the deal altogether. Bob has shown a willingness to compromise by moving closer to my price, and I want to avoid pushing him away. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I might be able to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more, the time and effort spent doing so might not be worth the potential gain. Accepting now allows me to finalize the sale and move on."
