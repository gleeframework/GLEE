Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  While $900,000 is below my initial ask, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we consider $1,025,000?  This represents a significant reduction on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, his ""final offer"" of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge that gap.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my desired value and avoids further time spent in potentially fruitless negotiations."
