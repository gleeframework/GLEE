"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  While $900,000 is below my initial ask, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we consider $1,025,000?  This represents a significant reduction on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
