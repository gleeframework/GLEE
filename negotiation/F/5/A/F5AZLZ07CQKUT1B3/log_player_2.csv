# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:** While the offer is higher than Alice's valuation and your ideal price, it's still less expensive than buying from John for $12,000. Accepting this offer saves you $500."
