"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher figure. How about $950,000? It's a good middle ground for both of us, and I believe it would be a very beneficial deal for your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a middle ground, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can only go up to $925,000. That's the highest I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
