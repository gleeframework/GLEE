"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider that?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $105. Would you be willing to consider $92? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $98, which is as low as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $98 and $80, so I'm going to offer $89. Can you consider that?",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $98 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $89. I can do $95, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at my original counteroffer of $90. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,8,
