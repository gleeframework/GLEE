"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $17,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay at $16,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is close, but to be fair, I can't go below $16,500.  I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at this price.",16500.0,Alice,5,
