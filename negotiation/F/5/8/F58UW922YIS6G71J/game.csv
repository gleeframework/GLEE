"Alice, $250 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $180. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $180 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $80. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $160, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm still only able to offer $80. I know you want to make a profit, but I'm sure you can find a buyer who's willing to pay more than that. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think you're serious about buying the product. I'll meet you at $140, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",140.0,Alice,7,
