"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fantastic product and you won't regret it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",11000.0,Bob,4,
