"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to move the product quickly and me to acquire it at a price that works for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
