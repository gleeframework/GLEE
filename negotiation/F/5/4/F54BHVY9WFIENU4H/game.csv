"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life and business.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to move the product quickly and me to acquire it at a price that works for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life and business, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,
