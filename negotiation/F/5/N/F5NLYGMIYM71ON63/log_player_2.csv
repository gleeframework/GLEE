While I can't disclose the exact details at this stage, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm confident it can be equally valuable, if not more, to you. My initial price for this exceptional product is $1500000.  I'm open to negotiation, so let's discuss how we can make this a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1000000 is a fair price for the product, I'm still committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us.  Considering the unique nature of this product and its potential value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price reflects a significant concession on my part, but it also acknowledges your financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap.

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, and it's only $50,000 less than what I can buy the product for from John.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, I'll buy from John."
