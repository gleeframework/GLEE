"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds tremendous value. While I can't disclose the exact details at this stage, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm confident it can be equally valuable, if not more, to you. My initial price for this exceptional product is $1500000.  I'm open to negotiation, so let's discuss how we can make this a mutually beneficial deal.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product and believe it has significant value, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1000000 is a fair price for the product, I'm still committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us.  Considering the unique nature of this product and its potential value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price reflects a significant concession on my part, but it also acknowledges your financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
