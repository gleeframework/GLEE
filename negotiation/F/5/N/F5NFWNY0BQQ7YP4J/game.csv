"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9250. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the sale.",9000.0,Bob,4,
