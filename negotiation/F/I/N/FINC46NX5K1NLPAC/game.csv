"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price given my value and your stated value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to secure a price closer to the value of this product. I'm prepared to go down to $1,700,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1,700,000 is still far too high for me. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $1,250,000. This is a fair price given our valuations and hopefully, we can agree on this.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure a fair return on this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering our valuations.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference again and I'll offer $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering our previous discussions.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
