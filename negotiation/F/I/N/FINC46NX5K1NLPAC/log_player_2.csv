Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to secure a price closer to the value of this product. I'm prepared to go down to $1,700,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure a fair return on this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
