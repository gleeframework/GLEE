Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification for Price:** By highlighting the ""significant value"" and ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet you somewhere in the middle. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
