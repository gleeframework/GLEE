"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good deal.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
``` 

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a good price for Bob considering his value of $1,000,000. It also leaves some room for negotiation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. It's a good deal considering he's offered $850,000, which is above my minimum of $800,000 and  John's offer."
