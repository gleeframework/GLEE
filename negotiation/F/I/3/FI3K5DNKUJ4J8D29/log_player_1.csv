Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum value, and I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is still a significant profit for me and is closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see that he's getting a good deal and accept this offer.  If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John at my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. I'm not willing to go lower, and it seems unlikely that Bob will increase his offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum price. I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future who is willing to pay more."
