{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's also a price that Alice might be willing to consider since it's still above her own valuation. This creates a potential zone for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,500. This is a good price for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and still higher than Alice's valuation of $8,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a fair price and avoid further negotiation."
