"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. My maximum is $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,200,000, which is $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
