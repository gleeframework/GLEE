"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While $135 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's compromise at $145.  It's a fair price that ensures both of us get a good deal. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
