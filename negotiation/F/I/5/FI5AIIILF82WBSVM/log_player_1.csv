"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully leaves Bob with the feeling that he's getting a good deal.  I'm also optimistic about closing the deal within the 10 rounds. However, I am aware of the alternative of selling to John for $150, which serves as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I am willing to accept.  While I don't want to lose the deal entirely, I need to ensure I receive a price that is closer to my minimum.  I will counteroffer with a price that is still higher than what Bob offered, but lower than my initial offer, to show I am willing to negotiate but still need to maintain a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is getting closer to my minimum, I am still hesitant to accept it. I am confident that I can secure a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation. I will make a counteroffer to explore a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While $135 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's compromise at $145.  It's a fair price that ensures both of us get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go down to $140. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal if I keep negotiating, but with only four rounds left, I risk running out of time.  The chance of a higher offer is less likely given Bob's consistent lowering of his price. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
