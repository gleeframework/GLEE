"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
