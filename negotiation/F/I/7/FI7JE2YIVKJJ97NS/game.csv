"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Alice,3,
