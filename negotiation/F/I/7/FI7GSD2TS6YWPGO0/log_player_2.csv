"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is a generous offer, and I'm confident it would be mutually beneficial.

While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside Bob's budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to his maximum."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer to a fair deal, I can't accept anything less than $975,000. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable price for this valuable product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  $975,000 is still over his budget, and it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  John is offering a better deal that fits within Bob's financial limitations."
