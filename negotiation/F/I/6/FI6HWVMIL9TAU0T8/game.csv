"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I need to at least cover my costs.  How about $16,000? That's still a good price for the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is the price I was originally considering. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",15000.0,Bob,6,
