Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $170. This is above Bob's perceived value of $120, but it gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us.  I'll be ready to counter any offers he makes, but I also have John as a backup buyer, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $155. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum price of $150. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't go much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to get a higher price, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
