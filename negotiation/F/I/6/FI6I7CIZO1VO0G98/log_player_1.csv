Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and your willingness to offer it exclusively to Bob, you create a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Leaving Room:** While aiming high, the offer isn't ridiculously above Bob's perceived value. This keeps the offer within a potentially acceptable range and encourages him to counter-offer if he's interested. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of either:

1. **Bob accepts the higher price:**  You gain a profit above your minimum.
2. **Bob negotiates:**  You have room to lower the price slightly, potentially settling on a price still higher than John's offer.
3. **Bob rejects:** You can still sell the product to John for your minimum acceptable price."
