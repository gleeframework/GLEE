Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you, given its potential.  I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Let me know your decision soon as I have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value and hints at other potential buyers to create a sense of urgency and scarcity. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob because you have John as a safety net. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase the product."
