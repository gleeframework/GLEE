"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $100? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
