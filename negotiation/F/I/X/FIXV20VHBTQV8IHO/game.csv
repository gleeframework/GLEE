"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you'll gain. Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000. I know that's significantly lower than your asking price, but I'm hoping we can find some middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $600,000 is far below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This still gives you a significant gain and allows us to close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be honest, anything over $800,000 is a non-starter for me. How about we try to meet in the middle again, say at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer. I'm proposing $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but we're still a ways apart. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $800,000 is absolutely my limit.  If you're willing to come down to that, we have a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
