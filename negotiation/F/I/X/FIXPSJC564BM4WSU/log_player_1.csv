Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $12,000 is still a decent profit for Bob, giving him incentive to consider the deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still holding out for a price closer to your minimum of $15,000.
* **It's a clear starting point:** The message is straightforward and invites Bob to respond, setting the stage for potential negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,000. I'm sure we can find a number that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value for the product. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or John. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still offers you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target of $9,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't accept anything below $11,000. I'll make another counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a lower price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me avoid selling to John for a higher price. This is my final offer, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
