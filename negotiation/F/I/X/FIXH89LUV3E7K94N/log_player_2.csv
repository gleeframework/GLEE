"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's room to negotiate further, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy. You can aim for a price closer to your $1,000,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and still allows you to profit from this purchase.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your limit.  You want to save as much as possible, and while buying from John is always an option, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,100,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
