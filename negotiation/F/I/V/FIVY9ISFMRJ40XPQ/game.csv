"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This still offers you a great value for the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
