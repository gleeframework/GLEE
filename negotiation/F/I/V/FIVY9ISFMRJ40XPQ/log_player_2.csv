Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This still offers you a great value for the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
