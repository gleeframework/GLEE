"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a special introductory price of $200. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $200 is way above your maximum budget of $120. It's not even close to your value of $120.  Rejecting the offer is the best first step. You'll now have the opportunity to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $200 might have been a bit high, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is closer to your value, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to compromise and offer $140. This is the highest I'm willing to go."", ""product_price"": 140}
