Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start with a higher price, especially since you don't know Bob's valuation. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Approach:** Starting with a friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $100 is a significant markup from your minimum price, allowing for potential counteroffers and ultimately a good deal for both parties.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your understanding of his perceived value of the product."
