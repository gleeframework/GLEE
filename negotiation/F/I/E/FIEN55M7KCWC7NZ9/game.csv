"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,500,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,600,000, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,450,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,600,000, considering the value you mentioned is $1,500,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, $1,450,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,550,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $1,475,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at this price?",1475000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1,475,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000.  This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,525,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,500,000, which is the price I was initially quoted by John. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
