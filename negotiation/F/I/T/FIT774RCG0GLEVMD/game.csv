"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $98, which is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",98.0,Bob,6,
