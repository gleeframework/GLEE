Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $175. I think it's a great deal, especially considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, but still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $175 leaves room for negotiation while still being a good profit for me. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Matches John's:** Bob's offer of $150 is the same price John is willing to pay. 
* **No Need for Further Negotiation:** There's no benefit to rejecting Bob's offer and potentially losing time and effort on further negotiation. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at the minimum acceptable price."
