"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for my budget.  I could do $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $1,600,000?  I'm confident this product will be a worthwhile investment for you at that price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it would bring to my business.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
