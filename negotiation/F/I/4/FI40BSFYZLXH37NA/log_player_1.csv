Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a premium price of $20,000. I believe in its value and think it could be highly beneficial for you. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification for the price:**  By framing the price as ""premium"" and highlighting the product's value, you might persuade Bob, even though the price is significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it doesn't mean you're unwilling to negotiate. If Bob rejects, you can always come down a bit, still aiming for a price higher than $15,000.

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy. There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer without counter-offering, leading you to sell to John at $15,000.  However, it maximizes your potential profit if Bob accepts or negotiates down to a price above John's offer."
