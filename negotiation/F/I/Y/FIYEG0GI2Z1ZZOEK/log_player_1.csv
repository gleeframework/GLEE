Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob is unwilling to pay my initial asking price.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially be more open to a higher price.
* **No Immediate Threats:** I'm not mentioning John or a time limit, as this could make Bob less willing to negotiate.  

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, I've achieved my goal!
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth my time to continue negotiating with him or if I should sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $150 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While $125 is better than selling to John for $100, there's a possibility Bob might be willing to go higher, or I can explore a counteroffer that bridges the gap.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $125 but lower than my initial asking price of $150. This will signal my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate you're interested. $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  How does that sound to you?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm offering a price that's in between Bob's offer and my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.
* **Remaining Firm:** I'm not dropping to Bob's price immediately, suggesting I still value the product and believe it's worth more.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the counteroffer, we've reached an agreement!
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to evaluate his next counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll consider selling to John or making another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Upside:** While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a good chance Bob won't go higher. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation would take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a significantly better outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $130. This is a good outcome considering my initial goal was to get at least $100."
