"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm thinking of a starting price of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $8,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price or slightly above.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000, but I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing we're getting close. How about we split the difference and settle on $7,600? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",7600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $8,200. Let's try $8,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If not, I'm open to further discussion, but I have other interested parties who are willing to meet my minimum price.",8000.0,Alice,7,
