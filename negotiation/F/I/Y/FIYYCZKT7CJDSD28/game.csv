"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is below the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $11,000. This would be a significant saving for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
