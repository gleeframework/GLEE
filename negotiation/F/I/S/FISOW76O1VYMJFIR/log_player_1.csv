Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a price I'd be happy with, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting $1,050,000 would be a significant profit, but I'm willing to push a little further, especially with several rounds remaining."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get a bit closer to $1,100,000, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a strong profit margin.  It's important to recognize a good deal when I see it, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a significant return."
