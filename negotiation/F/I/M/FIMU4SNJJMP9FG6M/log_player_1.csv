{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to get closer to my desired value. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $18,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, and I'm not sure I can get much more from him. It's better to accept his offer than to risk selling to John for a lower price."
