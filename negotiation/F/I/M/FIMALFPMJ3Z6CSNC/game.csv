"Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal at $10,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",10750.0,Bob,4,
