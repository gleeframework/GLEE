This is a reasonable starting point, as it's below your minimum desired price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you are willing to compromise, which may make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$10,500 is still below my minimum price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal at $10,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $12,000. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I will sell the product to him to ensure I get my desired price."
