# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,500, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
