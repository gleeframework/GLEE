"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I will be selling to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than your maximum budget and more importantly, higher than John's offer. You can save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing from John."
