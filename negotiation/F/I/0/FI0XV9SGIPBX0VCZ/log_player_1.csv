Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that is profitable for you.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** We know Bob values the product at $120, and you value it at $80.  Offering it at $100 gives Bob a $20 discount, which can be enticing, while still giving you a $20 profit over your minimum.
* **Considering John:**  While you have another buyer, it's always better to try to maximize your profit. Selling to Bob at $100 is more beneficial than selling to John at $80."
