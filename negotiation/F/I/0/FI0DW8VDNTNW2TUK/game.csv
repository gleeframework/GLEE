"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's still a great price for such a valuable product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
