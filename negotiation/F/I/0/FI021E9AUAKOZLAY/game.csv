"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from your initial offer and represents a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product, which represents a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired profit margin.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin that much. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
