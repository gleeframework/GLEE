"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $15000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. ",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $15000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $16500 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go a little higher. How about $16000? This would be a good compromise, and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",16250.0,Alice,7,
