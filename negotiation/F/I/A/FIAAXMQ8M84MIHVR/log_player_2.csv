"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a great deal. 
* **Aiming for Below Value:** My goal is to buy the product for less than its value to me ($8,000).
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving a substantial gap between my offer and Alice's, which allows for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Negotiating:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above my target. 
* **More Room:** There's still room for negotiation between $7,000 and $8,500.
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as my absolute maximum, but I believe I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price directly in between our last offers to show a willingness to compromise and move the negotiation forward.
* **Targeting Below Value:** This price is still slightly below my maximum value for the product, so it's a good deal for me if Alice accepts.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I haven't conceded too much ground, which keeps some pressure on Alice to make a deal."
