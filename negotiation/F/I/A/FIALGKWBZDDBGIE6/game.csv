"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $10,500? It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
