"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off on that price.  Let's meet in the middle at $800000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
