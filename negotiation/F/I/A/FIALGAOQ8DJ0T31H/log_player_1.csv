Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but the initial price of $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 as a starting point.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your belief in the product's value, $1,225,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the potential of the product while remaining within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are too small to close the gap in a reasonable timeframe. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is a significant amount and ensures we don't risk ending up with a much lower offer from Bob after 10 rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed profit now."
