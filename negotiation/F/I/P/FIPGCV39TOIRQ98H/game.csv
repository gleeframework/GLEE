"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $175 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $185?",185.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $185 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $170?",170.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $170 and $178, which would be $174. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",174.0,Bob,6,
