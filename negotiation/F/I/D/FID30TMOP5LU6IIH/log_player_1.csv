"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $175. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $157.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $157.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $157.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $157.50 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $162.50.  This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 162.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $145. Would you be willing to meet me at $152? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $152 isn't my ideal price, it's still a profit for me, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to avoid risking losing the deal and ending up with nothing."
