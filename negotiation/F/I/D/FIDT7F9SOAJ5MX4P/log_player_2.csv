"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Based on its value, I'm asking for $1300000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, Bob can potentially get it for even less. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my ideal selling point.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000. This reflects the value you see in the product while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.  What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $1,200,000 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his desired price.  Bob can likely negotiate further and potentially get it for a price closer to $1,100,000."
