"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has a lot of potential to bring value to your business. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still more than Bob wants to pay. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $850,000. This reflects a fair price considering your asking price and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's significantly lower than John's asking price and within Bob's budget. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiations or potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
