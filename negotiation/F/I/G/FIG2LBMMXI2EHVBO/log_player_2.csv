Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're trying to meet me halfway. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500. Buying from John at $12,000 gets us the product at the best possible price."
