Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute top end of my budget.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has shown he's willing to meet my baseline of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures I get a fair deal.  There's no guarantee I can negotiate a better price with him, and accepting a sure thing now is preferable to the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
