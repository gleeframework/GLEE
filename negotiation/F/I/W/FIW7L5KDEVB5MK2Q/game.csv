"I'm interested in your product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget of $15,000.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $14,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it.  I believe this is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering my budget and the value of the product.",15500.0,Bob,4,
