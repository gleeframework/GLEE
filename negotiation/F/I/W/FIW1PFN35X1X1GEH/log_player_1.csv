Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is too low for me, especially since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is simply too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,075,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm firm on the product being worth at least $1,100,000.  I'm confident that this product will generate significant value for your business, and I believe this price reflects that potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's counteroffers are getting too low.  It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk getting nothing."
