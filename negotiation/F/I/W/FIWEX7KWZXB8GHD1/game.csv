"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
