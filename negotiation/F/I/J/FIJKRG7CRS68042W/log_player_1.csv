Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering it at $11,500 aims to secure the highest possible profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($500) from the transaction.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, selling to Bob at a higher price is more profitable. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay.  Observing Bob's reactions to this initial offer can inform your subsequent moves in a real negotiation."
