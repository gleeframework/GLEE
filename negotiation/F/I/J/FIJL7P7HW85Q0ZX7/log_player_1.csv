Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, but Bob won't buy it for more than its value to him ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a profit if he accepts.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, there's no loss."
