"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $125. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd like to make a final offer of $115. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to buy the product from you.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $125. I think that's a fair price considering the quality of the product. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",125.0,Alice,7,
