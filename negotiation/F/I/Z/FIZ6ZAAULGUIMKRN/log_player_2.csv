"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, you are ""anchoring"" the negotiation to a lower price point.  Even if Alice rejects this offer outright, it makes it psychologically harder for her to hold out for a price close to $90."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $75. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to your desired price, $75 is still above your $80 fallback option (buying from John). 
* **Conveying Seriousness:** By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and not just immediately accepting any counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $67?"",
 ""product_price"": 67
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to move up, but not by a huge amount. 
* **Targeting a Favorable Split:** Aiming for $67 is an attempt to split the difference between your previous offer ($60) and her counteroffer ($75). While this might seem like a small win for you ($8 difference for you, $7 for her), it establishes a pattern of moving towards a more agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  You're still well below your $80 alternative, keeping pressure on Alice to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $67 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $72. It's getting close to the original price, and I think it's a fair deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her concessions are getting smaller. Rejecting this offer signals that you're not going to easily concede and are willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Approaching the Limit:** While $72 is closer to your $80 fallback, there's still room to negotiate. You're aiming to get Alice as close to $70 as possible. 
* **Strategic Timing:** With several rounds left, you have time to make another counteroffer and gauge Alice's reaction before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal, but $72 is still a little bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $70? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can both walk away happy."",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer shows you're serious about closing the deal at a price that works for you. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By emphasizing fairness and a win-win outcome, you're more likely to get Alice to agree.
* **Setting a Deadline (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, your language suggests this is your final offer, prompting Alice to make a decision. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  You're still below your $80 fallback, but ready to walk away if Alice doesn't meet your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $73. It's the last offer I can make, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has explicitly stated this is her last offer.  
* **Minimal Difference:**  $73 is only $3 above your target price and well below your $80 alternative with John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks losing the deal altogether. It's unlikely Alice will go lower, and you could end up paying $80 to John. 

It's time to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
