"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I was initially asking, but I'm willing to consider it. After some thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $875,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we agree on $800,000 and call it a deal?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
