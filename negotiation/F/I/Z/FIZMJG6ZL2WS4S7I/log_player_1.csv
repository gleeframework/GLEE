I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that allows for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I believe it's worth more than the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  I'm hoping Bob sees the potential in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I am not ready to accept it yet. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum threshold. This shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate but still value the product highly. Hopefully, this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is closer to my desired price point.  While I would love to get closer to $1,800,000,  I am not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a good price than to push for more and lose the deal entirely."
