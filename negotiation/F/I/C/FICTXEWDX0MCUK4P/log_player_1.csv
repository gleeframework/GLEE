Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but we're getting closer. I'm going to accept his offer this time, as I don't want to risk losing him completely and having to sell to John for a lower price than I'd prefer."
