"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $1400000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1400000 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I've already compromised by offering you $1600000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'm now offering it to you for $1550000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'm offering $1575000. Can you meet me at that price?",1575000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1700000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's value, but I still think $1700000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",1650000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000, and I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $1675000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",1675000.0,Alice,9,
