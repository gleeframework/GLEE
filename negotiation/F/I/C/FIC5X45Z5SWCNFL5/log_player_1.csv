Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,580,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.

``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,580,000 is a strong price.  While I'd ideally want more, his consistent negotiation shows he's serious, and waiting for a potentially slightly better offer isn't worth the risk of him walking away."
