"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if I can get a better price by negotiating. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is close, but I'm only able to go up to $1,050,000 at this point. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation and allows for potential concessions. $1,050,000 is still within my budget and might be a good starting point to reach a compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. This counteroffer is a good balance between meeting Alice's needs and keeping my expenses in check."

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I'm only able to go up to $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I am willing to budge. However, it's still well below Alice's final offer.  It's a calculated move to see if Alice will meet me halfway. If she accepts, I'll be happy with the deal. If not, I'll have to decide between her next offer or going with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I can see you're serious about this purchase.  Let's settle this right now - $1,095,000.  This reflects the significant value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  This is my final offer.
