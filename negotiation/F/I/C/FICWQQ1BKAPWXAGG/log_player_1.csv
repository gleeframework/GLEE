{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is still below my minimum value of $150. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum value, so it's the best option in this situation."
