Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to you.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. You're better off trying to get a lower price from Alice in the next round or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than your $8,000 threshold, and you've already had several rounds of negotiation. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
