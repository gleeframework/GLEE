"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both parties.",9000.0,Alice,5,
