"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to potentially get an even better price from Alice.  It also gives me more information about how much she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to compromise.  $800,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation if she's truly interested in selling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price considering my initial offer of $800,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good deal, and it's better than the alternative."
