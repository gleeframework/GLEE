,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $16,000. Would you consider that?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $16,000 is still a bit more than I'd hoped to spend. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! I can do $15,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's the absolute limit for me.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! I can meet you at $14,500, but I'm not going to budge any further. I'll throw in a small concession: I'll also include a free accessory worth $500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",14500.0,Alice,7,
