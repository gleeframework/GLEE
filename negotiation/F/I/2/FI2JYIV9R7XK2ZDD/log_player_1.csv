Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,000 is not even close to my minimum. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. This is still a good deal for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm not comfortable accepting less than $15,000. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I will sell the product to him."
