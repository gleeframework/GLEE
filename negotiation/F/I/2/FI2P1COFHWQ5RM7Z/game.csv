"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering it's still significantly above your valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still provides you with a significant gain, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000? This would give us both a good deal and move us closer to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
