"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $95. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort you're putting into the negotiation.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've put into the negotiation so far.",100.5,Alice,5,
