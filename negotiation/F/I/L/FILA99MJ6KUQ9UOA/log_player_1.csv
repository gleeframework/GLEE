Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum value of $120.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $60.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100.  This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that we'll reach a stalemate or he'll simply walk away. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
