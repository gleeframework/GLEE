"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for you and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
