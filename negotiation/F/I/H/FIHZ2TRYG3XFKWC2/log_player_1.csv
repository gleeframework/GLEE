Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is higher than $8,000, giving Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to lower the price if Bob counteroffers, but you're not giving away the product for less than you're willing to accept.
* **It's a clear offer:** It sets a clear price point for Bob to consider.

Remember, if Bob rejects the offer, you can always counteroffer, but you'll need to be strategic and consider John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what you're aiming for.  You still have some leverage with John's offer as a backup, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  I'm really keen on this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's likely that Bob is close to his maximum, and you've already lowered your price significantly.  While $9,250 isn't your ideal price, it's a much better deal than selling to John for $15,000.  You've secured a sale and saved yourself some potential negotiation headache."
