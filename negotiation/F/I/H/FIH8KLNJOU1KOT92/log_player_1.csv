Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $120 to me and $80 to him. I believe this leaves room for negotiation if he's interested but also gives me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering to lower the price to $100. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both of our values for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 to ensure I get a fair price."
