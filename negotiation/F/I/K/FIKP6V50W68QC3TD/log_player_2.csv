"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, you can likely do better. It's still within your budget, so rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $105.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for you.  It's still within your budget, and it's better than the $120 you would pay John.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and the risk that Alice might reject your next counteroffer."
