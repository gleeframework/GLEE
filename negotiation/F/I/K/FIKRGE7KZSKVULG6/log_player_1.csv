Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a quicker sale. 
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time"" to create urgency and justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price higher than $1,450,000. 

This strategy balances the guaranteed sale to John with the potential for a higher profit from Bob."
