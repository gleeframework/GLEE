Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification for Price:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value (""significant value"", ""business acumen"", ""potential""), attempting to justify the higher price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and ""limited-time offer"" aims to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out.

**Goal:** The goal is to maximize profit. While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward of securing a higher price than John's offer makes it a calculated risk."
