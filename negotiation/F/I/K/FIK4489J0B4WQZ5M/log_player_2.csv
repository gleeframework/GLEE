"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to pay as little as possible. Alice's initial offer of $120 is still above your maximum price of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is willing to sell for $100, a counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still too high. While you can't go any lower than $105 without losing money, it's better to keep negotiating to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already rejected $105.  This counteroffer of $110 is a slight increase, showing you are willing to compromise but still striving for a lower price. It's a middle ground that might be more appealing to Alice than a flat refusal of her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above your desired price range. You're getting closer to your target, but it's worth trying to negotiate further. You have more rounds left, and there's still a chance Alice might be willing to accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've been steadily increasing our offer, and Alice has been steadily lowering hers. This counteroffer of $115 is a middle ground. It's a compromise that could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price range, it's still higher than you'd like to pay. You have 3 rounds left, so there's still time to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've been slowly increasing our offer and Alice's offer has been decreasing, so this counteroffer of $120 represents a significant compromise on our part. This shows Alice we're serious about buying the product, but also puts pressure on her to make a final decision. We have two rounds left before we have to resort to John, and this offer is the highest we're willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is only $10 lower than John's price, and we only have one round left. It's not worth risking another rejection, as it's very unlikely Alice will drop to our desired price range.  Buying from John is the most sensible option to ensure we get the product."
