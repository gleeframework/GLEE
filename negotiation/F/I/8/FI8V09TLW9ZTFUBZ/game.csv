"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your offer, but unfortunately, I still can't meet the price of $1,100,000. I'd like to stick to my original offer of $900,000 if possible. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the price.  $900,000 is too low for me to consider. Let's make this work, how about we settle at $1,050,000? This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm unable to move past $900,000. I'm sorry, but I don't think we'll be able to reach an agreement on this. I'll consider buying the product from John instead.",900000.0,Bob,6,
