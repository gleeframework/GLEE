Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm unable to move past $900,000. I'm sorry, but I don't think we'll be able to reach an agreement on this. I'll consider buying the product from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob seems firmly set at $900,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether. Accepting his offer secures a $100,000 profit over John's guaranteed price."
