"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $975,000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.  Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your final offer is $975,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I think I've reached my limit.
