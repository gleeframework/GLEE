"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product at a price below its true value to you while still giving me a fair return. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, it's still a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have room to negotiate a better price, as Alice is willing to sell for less than your maximum. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always buy from John if negotiations fail, but you'd prefer to save money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows you to make a significant gain while ensuring I get a fair return on my product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering the product for $1,350,000.
* **Further negotiation may be risky.**  While you could try to get a lower price, it's possible Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **It's a good deal for both parties.**  You're getting the product at a price below your maximum, and Alice is getting a fair return."
