"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This still leaves you with a profit and allows me to purchase it within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows you to make a significant gain while ensuring I get a fair return on my product. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
