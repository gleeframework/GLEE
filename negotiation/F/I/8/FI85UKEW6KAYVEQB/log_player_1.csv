Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Potential for Profit:** Bob values the product at $80, and your minimum is $80.  By offering it at $120, you have the potential to make a $40 profit. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your pricing with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
