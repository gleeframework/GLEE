Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""true worth and potential"" you're focusing on value rather than just the price tag.
* **Open for discussion:**  The tone is not demanding, but rather inviting a response and potential negotiation. 

**Important:** It's crucial to be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then decide whether to negotiate further or stick closer to your original price knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
