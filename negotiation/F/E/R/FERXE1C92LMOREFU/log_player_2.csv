"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can still get the product from John for a much better price, so there's no reason to accept Alice's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still above his preferred price. He can get the product from John for $8,000 and save $2,500, so he should continue negotiating or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
