Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, implying that it's worth more than the price I'm offering.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting with my absolute minimum, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on your product, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can negotiate a higher price with him in the next round.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $13,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-proposal that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Keeping Options Open:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, while still allowing me to walk away and sell to John if needed."
