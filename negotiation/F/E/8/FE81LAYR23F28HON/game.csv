"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. While I'm confident it's worth significantly more than $800,000 to me, I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its potential value to you.  Let's talk about a price of $1,200,000. This gives you a substantial profit margin while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
