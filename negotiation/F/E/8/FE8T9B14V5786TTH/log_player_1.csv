{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $120 is significantly more than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  $120 is less than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's a clear starting point:** This offer clearly communicates your desired price and opens the conversation for potential negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

While $100 is more than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $100 is a good offer, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my original asking price.  How about $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$105 is a good price, and it's getting close to my initial desired price of $110. It's also significantly more than what I could get from John.  I'm happy to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
