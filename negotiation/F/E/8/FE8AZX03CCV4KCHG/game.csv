"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. What do you say?",115.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $125 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",120.0,Bob,4,
