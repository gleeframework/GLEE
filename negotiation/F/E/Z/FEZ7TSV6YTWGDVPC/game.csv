"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,000,000 is not within my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still quite a ways away from what I have in mind.  Perhaps we can meet somewhere in the middle?  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we are getting closer.  To show I'm serious about finding common ground, I'll come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction, and reflects my desire to see this product in your hands. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price and would be a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
