"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to be compensated fairly for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  That would be a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
