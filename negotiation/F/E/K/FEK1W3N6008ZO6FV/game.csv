"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,800,000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this still reflects a fair deal considering its unique value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part and is the highest I'm able to go.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
