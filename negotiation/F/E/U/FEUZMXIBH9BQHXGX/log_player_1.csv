{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1000000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1100000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I propose a counteroffer of $1125000. This is my best offer given the situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,125,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already reached a point where it's better for me to sell to John and ensure a guaranteed profit."
