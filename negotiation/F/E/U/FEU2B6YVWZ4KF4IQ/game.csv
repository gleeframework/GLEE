"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I believe the true potential of this product warrants a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the significant value this product brings. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I value the product, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer is fair and allows us both to benefit from the deal. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
