# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I believe the true potential of this product warrants a higher price point.
