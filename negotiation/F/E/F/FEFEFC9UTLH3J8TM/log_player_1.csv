# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

While Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I want to see if I can get him to meet my price before I consider selling to John."
