"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1100000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1250000 is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1225000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is my absolute minimum.
