"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm ready to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you are not willing to go higher, I will have to decline your offer and explore other options. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that balances my needs with the value of the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
