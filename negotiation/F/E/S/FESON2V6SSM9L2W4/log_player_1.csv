"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is aggressive, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm ready to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have a guaranteed sale with John at a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I have a guaranteed sale with John at a much higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price or at least match John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you are not willing to go higher, I will have to decline your offer and explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that balances my needs with the value of the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I've already rejected Bob's offer twice, and there are only 4 rounds left.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000, it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Bob. It's better to secure the higher price and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting further offers."
