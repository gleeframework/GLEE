Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a higher price initially allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, I can always come down to $100 knowing John provides a safety net. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hopefully making the slightly higher price more palatable."
