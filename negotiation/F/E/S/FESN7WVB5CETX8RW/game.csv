"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that could be a real game-changer for your business.  My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a great product, but I've done my research and I think it's worth less than your initial offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is just not feasible for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,350,000. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but unfortunately, I can't go lower than $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and potential. This is my final offer. If you're not able to agree to this, I'll have to consider other options. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a significant concession from my end. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this number.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
