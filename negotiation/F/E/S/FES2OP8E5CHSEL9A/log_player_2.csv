"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice's offer is your maximum budget, there is no reason to accept it immediately. You can try to negotiate a lower price.  If you can't get a better deal from Alice, you can always buy from John for the same price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  I'm interested but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my ideal price point. I want to try and negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000. There's room to bargain, and I can still buy from John for the same price if this doesn't work out."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and I'm now only $25,000 away from my ideal price.  It's not a huge difference, and I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Accepting this offer saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John."
