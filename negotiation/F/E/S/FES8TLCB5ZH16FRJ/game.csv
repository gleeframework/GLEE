"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and closer to what I can afford. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is a good middle ground that takes into account your budget and the value of the product to me.",15500.0,Alice,5,
