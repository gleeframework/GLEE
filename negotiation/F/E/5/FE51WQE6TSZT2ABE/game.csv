"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
