"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your feedback, Bob! I can do $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price.** While still not ideal, $11,200 is only $200 more than Bob's counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation is risky.**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. He might end up paying more or having to buy from John for a higher price.
* **The potential savings are minimal.** The difference between $11,200 and $12,000 (buying from John) is only $800. 

Given these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to ensure Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without taking a significant risk."
