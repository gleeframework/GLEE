"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your time, $9000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $9500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $10500? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
