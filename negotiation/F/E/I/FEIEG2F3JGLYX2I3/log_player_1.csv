Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product to Bob for $119, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You're aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to pay, which is just under his maximum valuation.
* **Ensuring a Sale:** You're offering a price that's still attractive to Bob, making it likely he'll accept and you won't have to resort to selling to John."
