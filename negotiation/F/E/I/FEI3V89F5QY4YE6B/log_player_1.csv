Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price close to your maximum ($149) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Slight Discount Psychology:** Offering a dollar less than your guaranteed price might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal, even though it's still significantly higher than his perceived value.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or reject it outright.  You'll need to decide if you want to negotiate further or stick to your minimum price of $150."
