Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm going to start with my minimum price, $12,000.  This is my floor, and I'm confident John will buy it at this price if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $11,000.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm serious about making a deal.  With each round, I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation. I hope this will convince him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is finally at his valuation, but it's still below my minimum desired price. With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't have time to negotiate further. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000, which is a much better outcome for me."
