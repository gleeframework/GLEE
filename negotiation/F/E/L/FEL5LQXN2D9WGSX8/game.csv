"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,200,000, which is closer to the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
