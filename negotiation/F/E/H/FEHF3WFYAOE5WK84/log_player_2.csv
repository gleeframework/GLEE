It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $10,000."

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you can try to negotiate further, it's risky. You only have 7 rounds left, and there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price.  Accepting this offer means you get the product for a reasonable price, and still have some room to negotiate with John later if you need to."
