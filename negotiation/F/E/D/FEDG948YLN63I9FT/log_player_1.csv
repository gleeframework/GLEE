{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a real game-changer, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,750,000. This is a significant price reduction considering its true worth, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us. I highlight the product's value and mention the price reduction, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By starting with a higher price, I leave room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. This allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and willing to pay closer to my desired price.

This is just the initial offer. I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the ongoing negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and meets my financial goal. 

It's important to consider:

* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially needing to deal with John, which might involve additional hassle and time.
* **Compromise:**  Bob's offer represents a fair compromise,  considering his initial valuation and my desired price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and avoid potential complications with further negotiations."
