"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal for both of us, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me and framing the offer as a good deal for both of us.
* **Room for Compromise:** By starting at $110, I have room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's better than his initial assessment of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  
* **I have time for negotiation.** I'm not desperate to sell, and I have 9 more rounds to potentially reach a better price. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net.**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $100 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I can't go as low as $85 right now. How about $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and a good deal for him. 
* **Opportunity for Agreement:** $95 leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, but it's a more realistic price point that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $90 is a significant compromise from his previous offer, and it's only $10 below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  While I can hold out for more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll have to settle for John's $100 offer. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Accepting $90 allows me to secure a sale and move on to other potential opportunities.  

This is a good compromise that allows me to get a decent price for the product, minimizing risk and maximizing potential profit."
