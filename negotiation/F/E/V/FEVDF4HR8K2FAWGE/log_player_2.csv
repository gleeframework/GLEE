"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fair deal considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice presents it as a fair deal, there's no incentive for you to accept. You can get the same price from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or she might offer a lower price in a subsequent offer."
