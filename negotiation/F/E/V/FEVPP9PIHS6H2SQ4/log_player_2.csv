Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Could you consider $1,200,000? This price reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget.

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit high. There is still room for negotiation, and you're not in a rush to buy the product.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
