"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the value of this product, and I do too. However, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the significant cost savings compared to John's offer. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
