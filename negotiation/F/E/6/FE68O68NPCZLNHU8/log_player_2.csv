"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've priced at $12,000, considering its potential benefits. I know you're a discerning buyer, so I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of $8,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* While buying from John at $15,000 is your absolute maximum, it's worthwhile to see if Alice will come down closer to your $15,000 limit. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for a counter-offer that could save you a significant amount of money."
