"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1150000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a more reasonable compromise considering your concerns.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This price is a fair reflection of the value I see in the product, and it's closer to a deal we can both agree on. Let's aim for a successful transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to make another compromise and meet you at $1120000. This price is still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product,  $1120000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to offer $1110000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1110000.0,Bob,6,
