Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,750,000. Given its potential, I'm confident this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we can afford to start the negotiation significantly higher with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, aiming to justify the high asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price of $1,750,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.

**The Goal:** The aim is to secure a deal with Bob above the guaranteed $1,500,000. However, if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is still in a favorable position with John as a backup buyer."
