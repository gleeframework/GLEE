"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $1,400,000.  It's a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm looking to spend no more than $1,250,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm confident this product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This still leaves a healthy profit margin for you, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is strict.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This would give you a good profit, and it's the maximum I can afford right now.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm close to accepting your offer, but I need to ensure a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000.  This gives us both a fair deal and avoids further negotiation.  What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be, but I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?",1310000.0,Bob,6,
