# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm confident this product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This still leaves a healthy profit margin for you, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let me know your thoughts.
