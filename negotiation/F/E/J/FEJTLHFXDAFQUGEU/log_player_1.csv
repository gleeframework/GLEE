This offer is a starting point. It's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still significantly less than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring you still make a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to accept it. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider coming down to $1,000,000? This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring I don't go over my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's a good deal considering my minimum value for the product and the risk of further negotiations.  It's a better outcome than selling to John for $1,200,000."
