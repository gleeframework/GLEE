"Alice, while I appreciate your offer and understand the potential of this product, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $1000000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1000000 is certainly not unreasonable, I'm confident this product can deliver far more value than that.  To demonstrate my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1250000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer, but still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1250000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1000000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $1125000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
