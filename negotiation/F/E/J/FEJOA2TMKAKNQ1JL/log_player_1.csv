{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is certainly not unreasonable, I'm confident this product can deliver far more value than that.  To demonstrate my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer, but still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's worth.

Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $1125000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.
