Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly closer to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) than your minimum value ($8,000).  This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still giving you a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer compromises slightly from your initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to your desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,700 is only slightly lower than John's offer of $8,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly higher price.  Accepting this offer guarantees a profit, and the negotiation process has already been time-consuming."
