"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,600,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a good profit margin.  I believe this price is fair and hope Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit, and $1,650,000 is within my acceptable range. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
