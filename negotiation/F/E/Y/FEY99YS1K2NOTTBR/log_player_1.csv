Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation ($14,000) maximizes the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob directly avoids the potential delay of going to John. A faster sale is generally preferable.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is strong, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to an even higher sale price."
