"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, and I'm willing to pay $110 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be great to close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a bit more for the product. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $112. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product, and I'm willing to pay $111. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $111 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a bit more for the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $113. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",113.0,Alice,7,
