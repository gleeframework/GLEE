I'm starting with an offer of $17,500. This gives Bob a little room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm confident in the value of the product and believe this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value and it's a good starting point for a potential negotiation.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
