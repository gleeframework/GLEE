Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to my desired value than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob to make the offer more enticing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.**  While it's closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still significantly less than the $1,000,000 I could get from John.
* **Negotiation room:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still potential to reach a price that's closer to my desired value. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and have the opportunity to achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to continue this negotiation. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but still above his initial offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, keeping some leverage for further negotiations.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the value he'll receive from the product, making the offer more appealing.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still keeping the possibility for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $875,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.**  Even though we've been negotiating, $875,000 is still significantly lower than the $1,000,000 I could get from John.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  While I could make a counteroffer, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer substantially. There's a higher chance of reaching an impasse with him.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my desired outcome.

In this situation, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed profit from John than to continue negotiating with Bob, which carries the risk of a prolonged process and potentially a lower price."
