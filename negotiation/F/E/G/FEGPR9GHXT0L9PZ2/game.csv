"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you, given its value of $1,200,000. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,300,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about we settle around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,150,000 is my final offer. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if you're agreeable.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
