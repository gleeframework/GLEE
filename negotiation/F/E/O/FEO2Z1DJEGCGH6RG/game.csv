"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a great deal for the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's make a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
