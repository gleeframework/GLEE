"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $135 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with the guaranteed lower price."
