"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $110. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
