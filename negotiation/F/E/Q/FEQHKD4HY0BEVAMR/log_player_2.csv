"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still more than Bob wants to pay, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer of $12,000.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal.  It's a better deal than buying from John and saves Bob $3,500.  There's a chance he could continue to negotiate and get a lower price, but it's also possible that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer minimizes risk and still provides a good price."
