{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You want to maximize your profit.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:** This gives him room to negotiate and makes him more likely to accept. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's responses.

Keep in mind, if Bob rejects, you always have the option to sell to John for $800,000, ensuring you don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to me is $800000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, there's still room to negotiate and try to get a higher price. By rejecting, you can counter with a price slightly higher than $800,000. This shows Bob you're willing to be flexible but also want to maximize your profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a little more. How about $820,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal. "", ""product_price"": 820000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to come down from your initial offer.
* **Still offers a profit:** You're aiming for more than your minimum, but also within Bob's range.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:**  You're actively engaged in finding a mutually agreeable price."
