Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $11,000. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, trying to sell to Bob first allows me to potentially earn an extra $1,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. He gets a discount compared to my guaranteed sale price, making the deal more enticing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely in this scenario, starting at $11,000 leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to get the most value from the sale while still ensuring Bob finds the deal appealing enough to consider."
