"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing the deal.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and inviting can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Question:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to respond and initiates the back-and-forth process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Exploring Options:** Rejecting this offer allows me to explore if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, but only by a small amount to signal my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $95 is a midpoint between our current offers, suggesting a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone to encourage further negotiation."
