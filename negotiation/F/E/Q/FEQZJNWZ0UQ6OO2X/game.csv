"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise.

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",675000.0,Alice,5,
