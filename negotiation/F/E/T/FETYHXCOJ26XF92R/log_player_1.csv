{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value and the market price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. This gives me the opportunity to potentially earn more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,200 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is slightly above my minimum acceptable price and is close to my previous counteroffer. It's a good deal for me considering that selling to John would only yield $15,000."
