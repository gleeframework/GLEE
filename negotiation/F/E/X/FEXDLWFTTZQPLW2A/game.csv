"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about $9,500? That's a fair offer considering your valuation and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
