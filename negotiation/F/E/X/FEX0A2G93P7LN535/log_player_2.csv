Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still leave you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.
