"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $10,000? It's the maximum I'm willing to pay, but I really want this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
