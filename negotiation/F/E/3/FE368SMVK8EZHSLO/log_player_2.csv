"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $125.** This is above your maximum budget of $150.
* **John's offer is $150.**  This is your maximum budget, but you're still saving $25 compared to Alice's price. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
