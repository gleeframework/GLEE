"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her own valuation of the product.  As Bob, I want to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to secure the product for a bit less.  I'd be happy to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate further, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for me as Bob, since my maximum is $1,500,000. It's also a good deal for Alice since she values the product at $1,200,000.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer, forcing me to either accept her offer or buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting her offer guarantees a good deal for me while minimizing risk."
