"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  A high initial offer sets an anchor point for the negotiation. Even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value, it gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Justification:**  While vague, mentioning ""value and potential"" aims to pique Bob's interest and leave room for him to justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates this is an opening offer and I'm open to discussion.

This strategy aims to:
   * Gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
   * Potentially secure a highly favorable deal early on. 
   * Set the stage for a negotiation where I concede downwards, potentially seeming more reasonable as we progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have plenty of room to negotiate and rounds left.  Selling to John right now would be the safe move, but I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 represents a more accurate valuation of this product's potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  Coming down by $300,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's still a substantial amount that keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's ""potential"" to steer Bob's focus towards the potential benefits rather than just the immediate price difference. 
* **Aiming for Above Average:** My goal is to land somewhere between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This keeps me on track to potentially exceed the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,100,000, indicating this might be his top price. However, I'm not willing to settle for less than my guaranteed offer from John.  I'll use the next round to make a smaller concession, testing his resolve while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand where you're coming from.  Let's find a solution we can both agree on. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This shows my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Compromise):** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between our last offers, I'm signaling a strong desire to compromise while still staying above my minimum. This approach can be persuasive as it seems fair on the surface.
* **Shifting Focus to Agreement:**  Instead of just arguing about numbers, I'm emphasizing the need to ""find a solution"" and ""agree,"" subtly putting pressure on Bob to reciprocate with a concession of his own.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):**  While I don't explicitly mention it, approaching the halfway point in the negotiation implies a sense of urgency without resorting to direct pressure tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal. Let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of him lowering his offer or me losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees I make the best possible deal given the circumstances."
