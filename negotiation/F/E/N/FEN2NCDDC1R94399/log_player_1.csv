"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initial High Offer:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be acceptable if he sees value in the product. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** This high starting point allows me to leave room for negotiation and ultimately get a higher price than Bob's initial valuation.  
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer, but I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This counteroffer at $1,600,000  demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable value.
* **Value Proposition:** I believe this price reflects the value of the product, considering my own minimum value and Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Although I'm still willing to negotiate, I'm keeping my options open by remembering that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the Offer:** I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,550,000.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable value.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, potentially encouraging him to meet me halfway.
* **Pressure Tactics:**  This counteroffer creates pressure on Bob. He's likely aware that I have a backup buyer (John), making him more likely to consider a higher offer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're now in Round 6, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower,  
* **Unrealistic Expectations:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and his willingness to negotiate seems limited.
* **Opportunity Cost:** It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer and meets my minimum requirement. 

**Conclusion:**  By selling to John, I secure a profitable sale and avoid the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob, who might not be willing to meet my minimum price."
