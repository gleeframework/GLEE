Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1450000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for you. It also reflects the fact that Bob is likely willing to pay more than your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for profit. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can reach a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows you're willing to be flexible, while still aiming for a price that's closer to your desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $20,000 less than your previous counteroffer, and significantly higher than John's offer.  While it's not your ideal price, it's still a good deal, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a better outcome.  It's better to secure the sale at this price rather than risk losing Bob completely."
