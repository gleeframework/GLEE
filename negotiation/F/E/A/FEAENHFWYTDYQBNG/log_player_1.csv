Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  The prompt states the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This is crucial information.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation (and higher than John's guaranteed offer) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Success:** While there's a chance Bob might reject the initial offer, there's also a chance he might accept it outright, or counter-offer with a price still above your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will purchase the product for $1,200,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about your deal with John. If Bob knew John's offer, he would be less likely to offer more than $1,200,000."
