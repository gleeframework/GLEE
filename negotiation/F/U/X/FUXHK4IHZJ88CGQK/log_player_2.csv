Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking $1,200,000 is my minimum, but I can do $1,200,000 - $20,000 = $1,180,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and while there might be a little more wiggle room, $1,180,000 is a good price that saves you a considerable amount compared to John's offer."
