"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1250000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking $1,200,000 is my minimum, but I can do $1,200,000 - $20,000 = $1,180,000. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,5,,
