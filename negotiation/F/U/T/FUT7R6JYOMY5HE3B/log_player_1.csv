Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:**  $14,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price than John's offer.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and optimistic, emphasizing the value of the product while also opening the door for dialogue.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* **Initiate a negotiation:** If he rejects, it allows me to understand his perspective and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Keep John's offer as a fallback:** I can always choose to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling it for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 
* **Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to pay more than his initial perceived value of $12,000. I'm confident I can push him a bit higher.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. My goal will be to find a price between $13,000 and my desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $13,000 is a little lower than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This still represents a great deal for you, and allows me to achieve a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $13,500 shows a willingness to compromise, demonstrating flexibility and good faith in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:**  The message reiterates the deal's attractiveness for Bob, reminding him of the value he'd be getting.
* **Remaining firm:** The offer still sits above Bob's initial counter-offer, indicating I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Test Bob's willingness to pay more:** If he accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* **Build momentum:** If he rejects, it puts pressure on him to come closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds. 
* **Keep John's offer as a safety net:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer and would like to propose $13,200 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  At $13,200, the price is now very close to my desired range and represents a good return considering my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Reasoning:**  Further negotiation might push the price higher, but it's also possible that Bob will become unwilling to pay more, potentially forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.

**Strategy:**

This decision balances the risk of losing a sale with the potential for a slightly higher price.  By accepting, I secure a solid profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
