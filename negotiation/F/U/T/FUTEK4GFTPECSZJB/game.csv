"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth to me. Would you consider selling it for $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $825,000 as a compromise. This still allows me to save some money compared to the original price, while respecting the value of the product.",825000.0,Bob,4,
