{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the potential value to him.  This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, where I can adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth to me. Would you consider selling it for $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $825,000 as a compromise. This still allows me to save some money compared to the original price, while respecting the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can get a better price from him if I continue negotiating. However, to avoid any further back and forth, I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
