"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,350,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we settle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I can't accept $1,125,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
