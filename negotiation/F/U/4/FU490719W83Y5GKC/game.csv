,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. How about we start at $12,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, $20,000 is already a significant discount from the original value I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
