"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to potentially sway Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, the deal is done.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed accordingly. 
* I'll keep the option of selling to John for $15,000 in mind if negotiations with Bob become too difficult or time-consuming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's close to his perceived value, it's still too low for me to accept.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more acceptable price. 
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm committed to maximizing my earnings and will only choose that option if negotiations with Bob completely fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer but still below my desired price point.
* **Maintain Communication:** I'll continue to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 just wouldn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,500.  This is a great price for a product that will be worth a lot to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $12,000 to $10,500. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify my counteroffer and encourage him to consider its long-term worth.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm framing my offer as a way to find a solution that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Decision Point:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I might be more inclined to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Time Factor:**  I'll continue to keep the time factor in mind, as I have only 7 rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Close Enough:**  While Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob seems willing to compromise, and I can likely push him a bit higher.
* **Selling to John:**  At this point, selling to John for $15,000 is looking more appealing, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I might suggest $10,000 as a compromise.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, I'll need to be more decisive in my negotiations.
* **Decision Point:**  If Bob's next offer doesn't come closer to my desired price, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  $9,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate further. 
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Response:**  I'll closely watch Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to make a more decisive decision.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the time pressure is increasing. I'll be more inclined to sell to John if the next round doesn't yield a suitable result. 
* **Selling to John:**  While I'm still hoping to strike a deal with Bob, selling to John for $15,000 is becoming a more realistic option."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $9,900 instead?

* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob seems willing to compromise, and I can likely push him a bit higher.
* **Selling to John:**  At this point, selling to John for $15,000 is becoming increasingly tempting, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I might suggest $10,200 as a compromise.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds left, I'll need to be more decisive in my negotiations.
* **Decision Point:**  If Bob's next offer doesn't come closer to my desired price, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for the best deal, and I respect that.  Let's try $10,200. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product brings, justifying my price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Decision Point:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to sell to John or continue negotiating, considering the limited time.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the pressure is high. 
* **Selling to John:** I'm getting closer to selling to John, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $9,950 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds remaining, the time pressure is significant. 
* **Price Gap:**  The difference between Bob's offer of $9,950 and my minimum price of $15,000 is still too large. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a sure thing, and it guarantees I meet my minimum price. 

**Conclusion:**  While I would prefer to get a slightly higher price, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob in the remaining two rounds outweighs the potential for a better price.  Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point."
