"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. Given its significance and worth to me, I believe it would also be a great addition to your collection or business. Considering its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers, I am offering you the chance to purchase this item for $12,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between its true value and your perceived worth, aiming to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations, and we can proceed with the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($15,000), it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget ($10,000). Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $10,000 is the best option."
