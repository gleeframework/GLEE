"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. It makes sense to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it's still within a reasonable range and leaves room for further negotiation.  It also signals that I'm serious about buying but need a more competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my acceptable price, but I'm still willing to negotiate further.  There's a chance I can get the price down to $12,000 or very close to it. I'll counteroffer and see if Alice is open to meeting me closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer and my previous counteroffer. It shows I'm still interested and willing to compromise but holding firm on getting a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my target price. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as I won't get a better deal than this."
