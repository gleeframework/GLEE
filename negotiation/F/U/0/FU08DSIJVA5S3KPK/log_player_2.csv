"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's a significant value to you, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is starting quite high, especially considering the product's worth to her."
