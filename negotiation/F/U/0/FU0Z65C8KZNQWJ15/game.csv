"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be open to a price of $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
