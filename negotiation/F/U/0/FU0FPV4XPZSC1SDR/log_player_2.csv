"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it will be very valuable to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its significant value, but it's also a fair price point considering your potential for gain.  Let me know your thoughts.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll lower the price to $900,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
