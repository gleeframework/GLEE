"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it will be very valuable to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its significant value, but it's also a fair price point considering your potential for gain.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll lower the price to $900,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
