"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What are your thoughts?

# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and $800000 is below that.
