"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and $800000 is below that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the minimum I'm willing to accept. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $850000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is as close as I can get to your upper limit while still meeting my minimum requirements. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $850000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",850000.0,Bob,6,
