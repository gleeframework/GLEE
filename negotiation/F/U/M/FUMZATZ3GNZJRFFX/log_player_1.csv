"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price closer to my own valuation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $12,000 is a significant amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and also acknowledges your willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $16000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $13,500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is closer to your offer and also keeps me closer to my valuation. I'm hopeful that we can finalize a deal with this compromise."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I really think $13500 is a fair price for this product. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I don't think Bob is going to budge much further, and his final offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum desired price.  To ensure I don't lose too much money, I'm going to take John's offer of $15,000. This guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
