"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which I believe is fair considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
