Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, her price is still significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer. At this point, it's too risky to continue negotiating with Alice. She's given a ""final compromise"" signal, and even if you can get her down a bit further, it's unlikely to reach the $800,000 mark that John offers. 

It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a price you know is within your budget."
