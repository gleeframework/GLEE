``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, so I'll reject it. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round of negotiations."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him up a bit higher in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower. To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John."
