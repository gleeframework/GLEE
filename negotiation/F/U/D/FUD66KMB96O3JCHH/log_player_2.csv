Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This would give you a great deal on a product that's truly valuable, and it would still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.
