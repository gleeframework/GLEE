"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to stay within a specific budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both parties.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a certain price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant step towards your asking price and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's settle at $1,175,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part while still recognizing the product's worth.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us and would like to move forward.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
