I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $150?  I'm really interested in getting this product, so let's see if we can make this work.",150.0,Bob,4,
