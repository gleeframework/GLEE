# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest a price of $140 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $120, ensuring you get a fair deal while also allowing me to maximize the value from this transaction. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is closer to your maximum budget than John's offer, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You're better off trying to negotiate a better price with Alice or going directly to John."
