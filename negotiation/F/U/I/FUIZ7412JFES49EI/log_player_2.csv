# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, we appreciate your interest in our product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price."

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could get the product for $800,000 from John, Alice's offer of $890,000 is only $90,000 more.  Considering the back and forth, it's likely Alice won't go much lower. It's a reasonable compromise to save time and effort."
