{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He's nearing the end of his negotiation rounds with Alice, and while she's thrown in a free warranty and support package, the price is still above his budget.  It's better to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with rather than risk getting stuck in a price war with Alice that may not result in a deal."
