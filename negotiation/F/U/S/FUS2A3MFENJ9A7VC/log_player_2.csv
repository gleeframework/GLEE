# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  $120 is too high, and I can likely get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, $115 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I think we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Alice's offer.  While $110 is still more than I initially wanted to pay, it's getting closer to my target price. It's a good compromise and better than paying Jhon $150."
