Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest in selling me the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.

I'm going to try to get a better price than $10,000 from Bob. I have 9 rounds left and John is willing to buy for $10,000.  I think there's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. This product is truly unique and worth every penny I'm asking. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $11,000, and I promise you won't regret it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

I'm going to keep trying to get a higher price. I'm not yet at the point where I'd be willing to sell to John, as I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite ready to drop down to $10,000.  This is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value once you have it.  Let's compromise a bit more.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us both come away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to keep pushing for a slightly higher price. I have 4 rounds left and I still think I can get a bit more from Bob.  If I don't get a better offer in the next few rounds, I'll likely sell to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still unable to go above $10,000. I hope you can understand my position. Could we perhaps meet somewhere around $10,000?
