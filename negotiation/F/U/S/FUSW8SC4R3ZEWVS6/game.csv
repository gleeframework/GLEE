"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. This product is truly unique and worth every penny I'm asking. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $11,000, and I promise you won't regret it. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite ready to drop down to $10,000.  This is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value once you have it.  Let's compromise a bit more.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us both come away feeling good about the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
