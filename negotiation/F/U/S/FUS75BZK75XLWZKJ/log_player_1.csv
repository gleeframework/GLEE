Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefit for Bob (""great deal"") rather than focusing on my own needs. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, making it clear I'm willing to discuss the price.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, which allows me to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I can't afford to sell for that amount. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him. I believe there's still room for us to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have John as a backup option, giving me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the Deal:** I'm emphasizing that $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Compromise:** My message conveys that I'm willing to continue negotiating. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not willing to drop below my $11,000 threshold yet, as I still have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my $15,000 value.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems we're hitting a stalemate. Bob is unlikely to increase his offer much further. 
* **John is the Better Option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price. Selling to John is the best option to maximize my profit."
