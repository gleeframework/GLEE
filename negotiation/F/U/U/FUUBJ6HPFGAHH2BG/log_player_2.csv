"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $85. This is a good deal, but you can potentially get it for even less. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to see if you can get Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $120.  It also leaves room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer to $90. This is still a good deal for me, as I value the product at $100. While I could try to negotiate further, there is no guarantee that I will get a better offer from Alice.  It's risky to keep rejecting offers, as I might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at $100. It's better to secure a good deal now."
