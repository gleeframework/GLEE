"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits us both. I'd like to start the conversation at $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  This product is incredibly valuable, and its price reflects that. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
