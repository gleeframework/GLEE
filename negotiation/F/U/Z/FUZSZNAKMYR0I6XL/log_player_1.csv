Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring I don't risk losing the sale to John.  Here's why:

* **Why not ask for $120?**  While this would be the ideal price, it's unlikely Bob will accept. He's likely to counter-offer, potentially leading to a negotiation that could lower the price. 
* **Why not ask for $80?**  This would ensure a quick sale, but I would be leaving money on the table. 

By offering $100, I'm giving Bob a fair price while still securing a profit that's higher than selling to John."
