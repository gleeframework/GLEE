"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This still offers you a good value considering the product's worth to you, and it's a step closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9800 is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $10200.  This offer gives you a great deal on a product you value and brings us closer to a final agreement.  What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10000? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
