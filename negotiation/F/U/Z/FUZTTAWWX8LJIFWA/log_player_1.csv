"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, which can incentivize him to consider my offer. 

**Next steps:**

I'll be monitoring Bob's response and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers or potential rejection. If the negotiation stalls or I feel like I'm not getting close to my desired price, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $10,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** Bob's message indicates he is interested in the product and willing to negotiate. There's still room for finding a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is the best option at this stage:** While I'm open to continuing negotiations, selling to John for $15,000 is the most secure and profitable choice right now.

**Next steps:**

I'll proceed to round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to sell to John if the negotiations don't yield a satisfactory outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This still offers you a good value considering the product's worth to you, and it's a step closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that $10,500 still represents a good deal.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** I'm stating that this is a step closer to my desired price, subtly indicating that further concessions might be limited.

**Next steps:**

I'll be closely observing Bob's response to this offer. If he rejects it, I'll need to reconsider my position and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  Bob's message shows a willingness to pay a premium, indicating he values the product. This implies potential for further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is still a good option:**  I'm still within the early rounds, and selling to John for $15,000 remains a safe and profitable option.

**Next steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum. I'll continue to monitor the negotiation progress and be prepared to sell to John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,800 is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $10,200.  This offer gives you a great deal on a product you value and brings us closer to a final agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($9,800). This demonstrates flexibility and continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the value the product holds for Bob, making it clear that $10,200 is a good deal for him.
* **Setting a firm boundary:** I state that $10,200 is my absolute minimum, subtly signaling that further concessions are unlikely.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll have to weigh the potential of continuing negotiations with the certainty of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10000? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Bob's message shows he is actively seeking a deal and is willing to meet me halfway. This indicates a high likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might end up selling to John for $15,000.

**Next steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether."
