Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to accept a price below my minimum value.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum value, but shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is fair, given the product's worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000.  John is offering my minimum value, so I'll sell to him."
