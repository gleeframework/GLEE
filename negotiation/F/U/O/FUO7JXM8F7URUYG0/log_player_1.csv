"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the ""steal"" aspect emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value ($120) as possible within the 10 rounds.  Starting high allows me to potentially secure a better price or at least gauge Bob's interest.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $85? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. This opens up an opportunity for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise.  I'll keep the possibility of selling to John as a backup in case negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value he's getting by reiterating that it's a ""great deal.""
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.

**Strategy:**

By offering $95, I'm testing the waters and hoping Bob will come closer to my desired price.  If he rejects again, I'll need to consider if I want to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stubborn Buyer:** Bob is showing resistance to move up from his initial offer. 
* **Time Constraints:** We're already in round 4, and time is ticking.
* **John's Offer:**  While I prefer to get a better price, John's guaranteed $120 offer is a strong fallback option.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm not willing to drop below $95 yet, but I need to carefully consider my next move.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to risk another round or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $85, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $90. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last compromise, increasing the pressure on Bob.
* **Small Concession:** I've lowered my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Decision Time:**  I'm putting the ball in Bob's court, forcing him to decide if he's willing to accept or walk away.

**Strategy:**

This offer is still above my minimum but is closer to Bob's preferred price. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to move on to John, as the remaining rounds are limited.  The ""final offer"" tactic may nudge Bob towards a decision, but it's risky and could lead to a failed negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $87? It's a compromise that allows both of us to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Running Out:**  We're in round 6, and with only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing the deal is significant.
* **Minimal Gain:**  Bob's offer of $87 is only a slight improvement over his previous $85 offer, and still far from my minimum.
* **John's Guarantee:**  John's $120 offer provides a guaranteed profit that significantly outweighs the potential of squeezing out a few more dollars from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to earn more, the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who seems resistant to budge, is not worth it. John's offer secures my minimum profit and ensures a sale within the limited rounds."
