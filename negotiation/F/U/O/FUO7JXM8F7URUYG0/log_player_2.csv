"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $80.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to $85, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $90. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still not within his ideal range.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $87? It's a compromise that allows both of us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
