"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. You'll then buy from John for $100 if Alice doesn't counter with a lower price."
