"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for both parties to benefit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This gives us both some room to compromise and makes the deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1300000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant concession, Bob can still do better. He's aiming for a price closer to his $1,050,000 counteroffer. There's room for further negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer. How about $1,100,000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $1250000, which is $50000 above your last offer. I believe this price is still a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,250,000 is closer to his target, he's still within his budget and can potentially negotiate a lower price. There's still room for both parties to compromise before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a little outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll offer you the product for $1300000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is hinting at selling to John, Bob should still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already within his budget and has room to go higher, but he should try to get closer to his target before resorting to buying from John. Alice is still willing to negotiate, and a counteroffer might be successful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and closer to your price. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not willing to go below $1300000, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'll make one last offer: I'll meet you at $1290000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and options. Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. While Bob could make one last counteroffer, the risk of losing the deal to John is too high at this point. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that is still below his initial maximum."
