"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This represents a significant opportunity to acquire this valuable asset at a price below its true worth. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
