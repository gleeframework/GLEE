Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,200,000 from John if I have to, so this offer is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I would prefer to get more, I'm happy to secure the sale and avoid any further negotiation."
