Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his counter-offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000. It's more profitable to cut negotiations short and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
