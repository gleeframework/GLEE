"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its potential benefits to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  This is a fair price that would benefit both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product significantly exceeds your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a more realistic number from you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I need a bit more. Would you consider $950,000? I'm confident this product will more than pay for itself in value for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
