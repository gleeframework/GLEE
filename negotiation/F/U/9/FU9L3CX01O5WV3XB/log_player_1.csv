Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be open to discussing a price of $1,025,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle on $975,000?  This demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing the product while acknowledging its true value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is moving closer to our million-dollar floor. While John offers a safety net, we still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $990,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's consistently stayed under a million, and we've reached a point where the potential gain from continuing the negotiation is outweighed by the risk of him lowballing further. Accepting John's offer guarantees our minimum acceptable profit."
