"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $175 and $140, which would be $157.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really get a lot out of this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $157.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you consider this offer?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $152.50. It's a good price, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",152.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $152.50. I'm willing to meet you at $147.50, and that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",147.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more compromise, Bob. I can offer you the product for $151. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",151.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $151 is still a bit too high for me. I've already told you I'm willing to go up to $147.50, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think we're at an impasse. I'm going to have to consider buying the product from John for $150, as I don't want to spend any more time negotiating.",147.5,Bob,10,
