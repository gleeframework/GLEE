{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John provides a safety net ($800,000), so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism."
