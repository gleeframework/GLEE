"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and making a counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm offering you the product for $1050000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $800000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider going down to $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm offering you the product for $1075000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $800000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
