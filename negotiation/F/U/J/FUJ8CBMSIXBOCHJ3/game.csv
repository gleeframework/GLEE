"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it brings to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would allow both of us to benefit from the transaction.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your minimum price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer and settle for $940,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're interested.",940000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $915,000 is simply too far below my minimum. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to go down to $930,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you gain from the product. This is my final offer.",930000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to go down to $930,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $905,000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with.",905000.0,Bob,8,
