Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

Round 7

# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $915,000 is simply too far below my minimum. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to go down to $930,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you gain from the product. This is my final offer.
