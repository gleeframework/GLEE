Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $100, so $110 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:**  $110 is still above your minimum of $120, meaning you'd still make a profit.

This strategy allows you to potentially get a higher price, while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is below your minimum price of $120.  It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  You can still make a profit by selling to John for $120, so there's no immediate need to settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

This counteroffer is:

* **Above Bob's offer:** It's a compromise that shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you profit.

By proposing a compromise, you signal your willingness to reach an agreement while also holding firm on your desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum price of $120. I don't want to risk negotiating further and potentially ending up with a price I'm not happy with.  John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is a better deal for me."
