"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000. It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a bit of a budget, Bob.  While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his $10,000 limit. He can still try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
