Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, it's best to start with an offer closer to your minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or a pleasant surprise if Bob accepts immediately.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $130 is a price point that allows for potential profit beyond John's offer while still being enticing enough for Bob. It positions the offer as a ""deal"" compared to your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can potentially lower the price slightly and still make a profit. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while considering Bob's valuation and your alternative buyer."
