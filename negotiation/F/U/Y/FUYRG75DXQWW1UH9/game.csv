"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,800,000. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer, I know this product can bring you even more value than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure it's a win-win for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen so far.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
