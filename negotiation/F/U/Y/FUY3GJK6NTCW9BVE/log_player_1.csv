Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob's higher valuation allows for a higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves a significant profit for me while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **First-mover Advantage:**  By offering Bob the product first, I create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially motivating him to accept before I explore other options. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob finds the offer attractive enough to accept."
