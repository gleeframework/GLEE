Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which is $1,425,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is consistently moving towards my position, and $1,425,000 is a substantial profit over my minimum and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing him away."
