Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so you can afford to be a bit bolder with Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price."
