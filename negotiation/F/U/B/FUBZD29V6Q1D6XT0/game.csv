"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's a good financial decision for me. Can you meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $1,200,000 is a significant step away from where I see the value.  Would you consider $1,350,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of what's being offered while recognizing your willingness to invest.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
