"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're starting with a strong offer that's slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly highlights the product's value without revealing our bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open and encourages Bob to share his perspective and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's a good financial decision for me. Can you meet me at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, we have room to negotiate. Accepting $1,200,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We're confident we can get closer to our desired outcome in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $1,200,000 is a significant step away from where I see the value.  Would you consider $1,350,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but firm:** We're making a counteroffer that's a significant concession from our initial price but still keeps us well above our minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reinforces the product's potential value to justify the price point. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By expressing confidence in the product's performance, we aim to nudge Bob towards accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still below our desired profit margin. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  We'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000, while still demonstrating some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of what's being offered while recognizing your willingness to invest."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Solution-Oriented:** We're getting straight to the point with a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Final Offer Implication:**  While not explicitly stated, the tone suggests this is our best offer, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price point ensures a healthy profit margin for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. Can you consider this revised price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob is using a common negotiation tactic to create a sense of urgency.  
* **Strong Profit:** While not our ideal price, $1,275,000 is still a significant profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks Bob walking away. Accepting guarantees a very good deal rather than risking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
