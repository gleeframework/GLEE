Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120 if this negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer. It's still a profitable price for me, and I'm hoping it will be enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is too low for me.  I'm willing to accept a lower price, but not that low.  It's better for me to sell to John for $120 and guarantee myself a good profit."
