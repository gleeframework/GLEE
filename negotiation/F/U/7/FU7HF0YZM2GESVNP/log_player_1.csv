Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's a great value for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to gauge his interest and set a strong starting point.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the value of the product for Bob helps him see it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Ending with a question invites Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation dynamic. 

**Note:** This strategy is a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged. We'll adjust based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum, it's still significantly lower than our desired price.  Rejecting allows us to continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  We've established a strong starting point and are willing to compromise, but we're not giving away value too quickly. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  We're confident we can get closer to our target price if we continue the negotiation process.

We'll counteroffer Bob, aiming to bridge the gap while staying within our acceptable range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising, But Not Too Much:** We've lowered our price, showing willingness to negotiate, but we're still above Bob's offer.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  The counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, aiming to signal our desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  We're framing this price as a ""fair"" compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $1025000. This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting for Now:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still too far below our minimum desired price of $1,200,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting allows us to maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Exploring Alternatives:**  We're open to exploring other options with John, who offers a price closer to our target.

**Next Steps:**

We'll counteroffer Bob, aiming to bridge the gap while keeping the possibility of selling to John in mind. We'll also carefully consider the remaining rounds and the potential for a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I need to be a bit closer to my target price to make this work.  How about $1,050,000?  This price is a good compromise and will allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**
