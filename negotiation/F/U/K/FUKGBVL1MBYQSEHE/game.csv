"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10800 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $10000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. I'm proposing a new price of $11200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $11100. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider another compromise. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to reduce my price by $200, bringing it down to $11300. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",11300.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your desire to get closer to your initial asking price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $11100. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $11250. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,6,
