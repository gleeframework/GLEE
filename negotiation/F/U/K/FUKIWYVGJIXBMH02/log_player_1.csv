Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or risk going lower.  I also keep in mind the safety net of selling to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $8,000, I believe I can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to risk a little to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to get a higher price than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving me some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,500.  While I was hoping for more, it's a good compromise that's significantly higher than John's offer.  The risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or even a complete breakdown, so I'm taking the sure thing."
