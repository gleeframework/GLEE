"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $9,500.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to Alice's minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.  Since Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, accepting this offer saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that further negotiation could bring the price down, but it's also possible that Alice might not budge further, and Bob might end up paying the same price.  Accepting the offer at this point ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the product entirely."
