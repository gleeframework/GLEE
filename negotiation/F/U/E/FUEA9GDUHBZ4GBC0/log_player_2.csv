"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $1100000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob is aiming to start the negotiation aggressively, proposing a significantly lower price than Alice's offer. This establishes Bob's intention to save a substantial amount of money.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, stating that it's ""higher than I'm comfortable with,"" implying that he's willing to pay, but only at a price that's closer to his ideal.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** Bob finishes with a positive note, indicating that he's open to finding a ""common ground"" to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1025000? This allows us both to walk away happy. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, Bob can still save more money. He's only $75,000 away from his ideal price.
* **Test Alice's Limits:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to test how far Alice is willing to go down in price.  
* **Time Advantage:** Bob has several rounds remaining, giving him more time to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Gradual Approach:**  Bob is moving closer to Alice's price but still pushing for a lower price. This demonstrates willingness to compromise while maintaining his bargaining position.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Bob appeals to fairness by mentioning a ""reasonable profit"" for both parties, suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's close this deal"" subtly implies a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Alice to accept a deal before Bob decides to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $975000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1000000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Lower Price:**  While Alice is now at $1,000,000, which is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still potentially get a better deal. He's only $25,000 away from his target.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By rejecting, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further.
* **Time on His Side:** With several rounds remaining, Bob has the luxury of continuing to negotiate without immediately resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my target.  I'm willing to go up to $987,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Bob is now only $12,500 away from his target price.  This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while staying close to his goal.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Bob again emphasizes ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Alice's sense of reason and urging her to consider a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Positive Tone:** The closing phrase ""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"" maintains a constructive tone and avoids pressuring Alice."
