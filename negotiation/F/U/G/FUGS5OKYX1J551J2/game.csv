"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This  still allows you to gain a significant return on investment, while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my means.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
