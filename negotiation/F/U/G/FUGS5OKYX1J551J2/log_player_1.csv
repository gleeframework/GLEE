Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to maneuver and creates the perception of the product's high value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This shows willingness to make a deal while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 provides a strong fallback position. This allows you to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly lower than both your desired price and even his own perceived value of the product. While it's closer to his valuation, you have room to negotiate.  You know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, giving you a strong alternative if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This  still allows you to gain a significant return on investment, while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by dropping $200,000, but remains significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasize Value:** The message reiterates the product's value and potential, subtly anchoring Bob's perception above his initial offer. 
* **Urgency:** By highlighting the fairness and mutual benefit, the counteroffer encourages Bob to make a move before you potentially walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is now very close to your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob in further negotiation, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainties of further negotiation rounds."
