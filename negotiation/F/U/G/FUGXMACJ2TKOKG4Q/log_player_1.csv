"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the good deal for Bob. 
* **First Round Strategy:**  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product to you. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I want to continue the negotiation to see if I can get a better price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can push Bob higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but there's a chance I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000 yet. My counteroffer of $1,050,000 still leaves room for negotiation but shows I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating that this price is still a good deal for Bob,  playing on the potential value he sees in the product.
* **Showing Flexibility:** By lowering my price from the initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Improvement:** We're getting closer, and I'm confident I can push him higher with a counteroffer. 
* **Time is on my side:**  We still have 6 rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a deal that's below my minimum.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but I'm still within range of getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000. I know this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, dropping my price by $25,000, to show I'm still willing to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** The message is optimistic, encouraging Bob to feel like we're close to a deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Time Factor:** We're now at the halfway point of the negotiation. I need to keep the momentum going but avoid being too aggressive, as that could push Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is stuck at $1,000,000, and I'm not willing to go below $1,025,000. We're at an impasse.
* **Time is Not on My Side:** We have only 4 rounds left, and the pressure to close the deal is increasing.
* **John is a Safe Option:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing with Bob is that he might not budge further, and I'll be left with a lower price than what John is offering.  The reward is that I might convince Bob to go higher, but that's unlikely given his stubbornness.

In this situation, it's safer to take the guaranteed higher price from John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,012,500. This is a final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm stating this is my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and his last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and could make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Alternative Options:**  By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob about John and the possibility of me selling to him.
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds left, I need to push for a deal, but I also need to be careful not to alienate Bob. 

This strategy is a calculated risk. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your effort in reaching a compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We are back to a stalemate. Bob is stuck at $1,000,000, and I am not willing to go below $1,012,500.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are down to our last two rounds, and there is little chance of a breakthrough with Bob.
* **John's Offer is Superior:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him not budging, leaving me with a lower price than John's offer.

It's time to cut my losses and go with the safer option of selling to John."
