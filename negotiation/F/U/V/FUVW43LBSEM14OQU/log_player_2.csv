"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to sell you this amazing product! I'm thinking of offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. There's room for negotiation to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go below $95. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $92.50 is a good deal for you. It's within your budget of $120, and it's still a bit lower than her initial offer. There's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a lower price with further negotiation, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
