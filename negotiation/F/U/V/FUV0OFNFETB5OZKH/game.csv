"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product, one that I believe will be a game-changer for your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you.  Let's start with a price of $1,200,000.  This allows for some room for negotiation and ensures a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this unique product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value it will bring to your operation, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure this product fits within my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point, and I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to move forward with the sale.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at this price.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
