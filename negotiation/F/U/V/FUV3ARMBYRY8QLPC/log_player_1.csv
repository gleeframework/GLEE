Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 if Bob declines.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice's strongest strategy is to offer the product to Bob for a price slightly below his maximum valuation. This maximizes the chance of Bob accepting while ensuring Alice earns more than her bottom line.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,190,000."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Why This Works**

* **Appealing to Bob:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price is just below Bob's valuation, making it highly enticing. Bob gains a significant discount and is more likely to accept than to risk losing the deal.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While Alice could ask for more, this approach maximizes the likelihood of a quick sale at a price exceeding her minimum.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further. Alice should be prepared to hold firm near her desired price, knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer."
