"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal compared to John's price of $120, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, I can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $90.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95? I think that's a fair compromise and we can both be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $100 to $95, which is closer to my ideal price of $90.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice could raise her price again or I could run out of rounds.  $95 is still a good deal compared to John's $120, so I'm accepting the offer to secure the product."
