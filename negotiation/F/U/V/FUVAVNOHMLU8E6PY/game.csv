"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,750 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
