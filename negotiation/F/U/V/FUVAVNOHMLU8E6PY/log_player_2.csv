Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,750 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and I can get the product for that price from John. It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John."
