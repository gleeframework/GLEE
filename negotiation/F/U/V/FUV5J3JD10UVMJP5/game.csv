"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and quality. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $18000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000, which I believe is a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $16000 is still a stretch for me, but I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is my final offer, as I'm sticking to my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $16500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,5,
