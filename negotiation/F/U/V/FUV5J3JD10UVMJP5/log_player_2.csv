"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000, which I believe is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  He should continue to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $16,000 is still a stretch for me, but I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer, as I'm sticking to my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $16500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $12,000. Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to get the product from John at his price rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice and risking a higher price or running out of rounds."
