I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't make a deal with Bob, the negotiations have gone on for a while and I'm not sure we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with.  John is offering a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
