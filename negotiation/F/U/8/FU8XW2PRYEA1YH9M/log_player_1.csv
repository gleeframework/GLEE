Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $1,400,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find common ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still slightly out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

This is a good deal, and I'm comfortable accepting it. It's close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
