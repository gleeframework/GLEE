"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,800,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth a significant premium.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
