"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you, which holds significant value for us at $10,000. Considering its immense worth and potential benefits to you, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product that could be highly beneficial for your needs or investments. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than what you can get the product for from John ($10,000). By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding to purchase from John at your preferred maximum price."
