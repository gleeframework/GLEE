"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I can do better than that. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'm happy to seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $825,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $837,500. This price is fair and reasonable, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 837500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $837,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, but that's my final offer. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $820,000 is tempting, I'm still hesitant to accept. I've come down significantly from my initial offer, and I'm not sure if Bob is truly committed to the purchase. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your need to secure a good deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, $820,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm going to need at least $825,000 to make this worthwhile.  I truly believe this product is worth it to you, and I hope we can find common ground.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $815,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to make a decision on this product, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob's final offer is only $15,000 above John's offer, and with only 3 rounds left, the risk of not securing a deal with either buyer is too high. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $800,000."
