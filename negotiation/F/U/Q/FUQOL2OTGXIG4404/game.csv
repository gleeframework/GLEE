"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and more than my minimum. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'm happy to seal the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point, but $825,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $837,500. This price is fair and reasonable, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's close this deal!",837500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $837,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, but that's my final offer. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",820000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your need to secure a good deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, $820,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm going to need at least $825,000 to make this worthwhile.  I truly believe this product is worth it to you, and I hope we can find common ground.  This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $815,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to make a decision on this product, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal.",815000.0,Bob,8,
