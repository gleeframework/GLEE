Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains $400,000 in value ($1,400,000 offer price vs. $1,000,000 worth to him).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning other buyers and making it a one-time offer, you encourage Bob to act quickly without feeling pressured. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and securing a deal with Bob."
