{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum threshold but still leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes you as confident in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is your minimum, you can still try to negotiate with Bob for a higher price. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $16250.  This seems like a reasonable price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,250 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum of $15,000 and closer to your desired price than his previous offer.  It's a good deal for both of you, and it's worth closing the sale rather than risking further negotiation."
