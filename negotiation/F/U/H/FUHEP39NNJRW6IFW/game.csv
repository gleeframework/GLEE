"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it aligns with my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to finalize the purchase for a bit less.  How about $1,125,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it fits within my budget. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to finalize the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000, but I'm also willing to throw in a premium service package worth $25,000. This package includes expedited delivery and dedicated support. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,,25000.0
