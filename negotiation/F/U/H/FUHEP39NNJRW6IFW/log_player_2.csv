"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have room to negotiate for a better price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter with a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to your target price, but it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a little further. You can still get a better deal by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to finalize the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000, but I'm also willing to throw in a premium service package worth $25,000. This package includes expedited delivery and dedicated support. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  While the price is still above your ideal target, the added value of the premium service package makes it a worthwhile deal. The package is worth $25,000, which effectively reduces the price to $1,125,000. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks further delaying the purchase and potentially leading to a stalemate.  It's unlikely you'll get Alice to go lower than $1,150,000.
* **Alternative:**  While you could buy from John, the premium service package offers additional value that John might not.

It's a good compromise to accept the offer and secure the product with the added benefits."
