"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1100000.  I'm confident this price is fair, reflecting the product's value and allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1100000. I'm willing to make another compromise and propose a new price of $1125000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $1125000. However, I'm willing to go up to $1105000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1105000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $1105000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a new price of $1137500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",1137500.0,Alice,7,
