"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $90 is a decent price, he can try to get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer, potentially lowering the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering a discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your feedback, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $80 to Alice, and Bob is willing to pay up to $100.  An offer of $87.50 is within Bob's budget and a good deal for both parties.
* **Opportunity Cost:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice further increasing the price.  It's also possible that Alice will walk away from the deal entirely, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting this offer, Bob saves $12.50 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving considering his goal of maximizing savings."
