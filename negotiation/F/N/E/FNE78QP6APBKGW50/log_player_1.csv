Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it really useful. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but still below my minimum price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm leaving some space for Bob to make a counteroffer without immediately hitting my minimum. This encourages negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to create a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **I have a better option:** I can sell to John for $120, so there's no reason to accept Bob's offer at this point. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of this.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value he'll get from the product to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still thinking that $80 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $90 is only $30 away from my minimum price of $120. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, it's possible that Bob might not budge further.  
* **Opportunity cost:**  I risk losing out on the sale completely if I keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer is a good compromise.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting the offer saves time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
