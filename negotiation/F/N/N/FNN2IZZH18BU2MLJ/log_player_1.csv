Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows for some profit for both of us. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and I can always adjust the price based on Bob's response. I've also kept in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
