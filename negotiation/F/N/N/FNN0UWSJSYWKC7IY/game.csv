"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1000000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me is still at least $1000000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000. This is my final offer, I'm not sure I can go any lower.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800000, Alice. However, I was really hoping to stay under budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $795000. This is my absolute limit, and I hope you'll consider it.",795000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $795000.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me at a price, Alice, but $810000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll go up to $795000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",795000.0,Bob,8,
