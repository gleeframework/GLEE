{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a significantly higher price (50% above Bob's valuation) creates room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and your confidence in it. This helps justify the high asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By inviting questions and discussion, you signal some flexibility while still aiming high.

**Important Note:** While John provides a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's strategically beneficial to try and get a higher price from Bob first. This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit."
