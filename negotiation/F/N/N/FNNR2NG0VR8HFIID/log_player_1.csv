Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($10,000) and higher than what Bob is willing to pay ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $10,000.  I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and even lower than what he values the product at. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,500, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  This is still above my minimum price of $10,000 and closer to my desired price. I'm also hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway, as he knows I have an alternative buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and try for a slightly higher price, hoping to come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm dropping my price just a little bit more to $9,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway, as he knows I have an alternative buyer in John.  This is a delicate balance, as I don't want to go too low and risk losing out on a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not quite there.  Further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a price that I'm truly happy with.  Selling to John for $10,000 will guarantee I get my minimum price and avoid any further risk of negotiation with Bob."
