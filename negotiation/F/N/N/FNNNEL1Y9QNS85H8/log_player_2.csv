It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $1,100,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.

It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get closer to your target price of $1,000,000 by making another counteroffer."

# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Alice's counteroffer of $1,080,000 is still too high.  It's better to go with John's offer of $1,000,000 and save the extra $80,000."
