"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're agreeable.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
