"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. It's a fair price for a great product. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $8,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
