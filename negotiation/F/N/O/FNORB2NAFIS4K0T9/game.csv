"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1000000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount? I'm looking forward to your response.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraint. While $1000000 is significantly lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? I believe this price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
