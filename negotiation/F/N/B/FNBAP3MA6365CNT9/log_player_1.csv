Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,500,000 (it's worth that much to her even if she doesn't sell).
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000 (he won't pay more).
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 with John.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice's best move is to offer the product to Bob at a price slightly below his maximum, leaving a tiny margin for negotiation but ensuring she gets more than her minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth $1,195,000 to you, and I'm prepared to let it go at that price. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1195000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Price Justification:**  Subtly anchors the price by stating Bob's perceived value.
* **Slight Discount:** The $5,000 reduction allows room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still maximizing Alice's profit. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer hoping for an even lower price. However, Alice has the security of John's offer, so she can afford to be firm."
