"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1550000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1450000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the product's value and my own investment. Let's try $1525000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's try $1525000 again, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50000. So, the total value you'll get is $1575000. What do you think?",1575000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the additional value you're offering, Alice. However, I'm still looking to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1495000 for the product. This includes the complimentary service you mentioned. I hope this proposal is more aligned with what we can agree upon.",1495000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1600000. I'm willing to give you a 5% discount on the original price, which would bring it down to $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1520000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a final price of $1490000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1490000.0,Bob,10,
