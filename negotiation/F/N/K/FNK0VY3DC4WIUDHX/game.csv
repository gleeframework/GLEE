"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
