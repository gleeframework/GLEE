"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value I believe this product holds for your business, and it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still firm on my belief that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $875,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and shows my willingness to work with you. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make a deal and finalize this.",850000.0,Bob,6,
