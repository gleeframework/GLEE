Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 allows a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum."
