Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $140, which I think is a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. It's better to get $140 from Bob than $100 from John.

This strategy aims for a high initial offer that's still appealing to Bob while ensuring a profitable outcome for Alice."
