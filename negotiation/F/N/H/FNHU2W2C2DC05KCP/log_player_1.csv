"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, a high starting point allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down from there. I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I can afford to be a bit aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $15,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept considering the limited rounds, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm choosing to reject and continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get a better offer than $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $13,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal while also maintaining a price that provides me with a reasonable profit. This counteroffer allows for some flexibility in further negotiations, and potentially leads to a successful deal in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is too low and is not worth continuing negotiations.  While we have a few rounds left, his offers have consistently been below my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob resulting in an even lower price."
