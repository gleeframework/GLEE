Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a good deal for Bob, as it's below the product's true value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I want to start the negotiation process and see if Bob is willing to come up in price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll likely make a new counteroffer, aiming to gradually decrease the price until we reach an acceptable middle ground. 
* If the negotiation becomes too time-consuming or unproductive, I'll have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  While I understand Bob's budget constraints, accepting $800,000 would be a major loss for me. 
* **I'm confident in the product's value.**  It's worth $1,500,000 to John, so I believe I can find a better price with Bob or even sell to John. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  I'm willing to explore counteroffers to see if we can bridge the gap.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'll keep in mind that I can always opt to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is significantly below what I need, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Highlighting the deal:**  I'm emphasizing that $1,000,000 is still a great deal for Bob, given the product's true value. This can help make the offer more appealing.
* **Staying open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question, inviting Bob to continue the conversation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll be happy to sell the product. 
* If he rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and make a decision based on whether it's closer to my acceptable price range or if selling to John is a better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to still make a profit, and I would be able to afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While he's getting closer, $900,000 is still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I can get from John.
* **The negotiation is getting time-consuming.** We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and I'm not confident that we'll reach an agreement that's satisfactory for me.
* **Selling to John is a safer option.**  I'm comfortable with the fact that John is willing to pay my desired price, and selling to him eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential loss.

**Next Steps:**

I will politely decline Bob's offer and inform him that I'm going to pursue other options.  I will then proceed to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
