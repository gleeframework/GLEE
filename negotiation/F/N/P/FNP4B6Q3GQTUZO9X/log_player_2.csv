"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price.  You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is significantly below what I need, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit. You can continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to your budget. There's still room for compromise, and you can always buy from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to still make a profit, and I would be able to afford it."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm going to need to decline your offer and explore other options.  Thank you for your time and interest in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $0. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $0
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she is unwilling to negotiate further and is not willing to accept your offer.  It's time to cut your losses and move on.  John is offering the product at a price that fits your budget, and it's the most sensible option at this point."
