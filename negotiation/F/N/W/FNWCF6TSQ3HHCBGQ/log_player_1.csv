Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob to make the offer more appealing.

This strategy aims to secure a deal at a price closer to my minimum while also leaving open the option to negotiate further if needed."
