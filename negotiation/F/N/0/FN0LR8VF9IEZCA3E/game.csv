"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
