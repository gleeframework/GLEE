"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out first. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
