Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You still have room to negotiate downwards if needed, and you can always go to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't come around.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  By offering a price below your minimum, you're demonstrating flexibility and encouraging Bob to participate in the negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers up to $8,000 for this product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

While $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,500.  I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's a sure thing, and it ensures I get the best possible price."
