"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and it makes sense to try and get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counteroffer reveals how willing Alice is to negotiate.
* **Establish a lower target:** Even if Alice rejects this initial offer, it sets a lower point for the negotiation.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  We have space to gradually increase our offer if needed while staying well below our $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is my final offer.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit from her initial offer, but it's still too high. We're aiming for a price closer to $8,000. It's too early to accept her ""final offer,"" as there's room for further negotiation.  We'll continue countering to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Movement:** We're moving closer to Alice's price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still staying below $8,000. 
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** Offering $7,750 is nearly a split of the difference between our last offer ($7,000) and her current one ($8,500). This can be a persuasive tactic.
* **Justifying the Offer:**  We're explaining our logic and emphasizing the significant increase from our previous offer, hoping to encourage Alice to accept."
