"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to the value Bob places on the product, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the value Bob gets by purchasing the product can encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price is not too high to scare Bob off immediately, allowing for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9500 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value Still High:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still slightly below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my ideal price. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a chance with Bob for a potentially higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a compromise here!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Rationale:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while sticking to my desired profit.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering $9,000 is a clear middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** The counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if needed,  keeping the deal potentially open for more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  How about $8750? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still slightly below my minimum of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I want to see if we can find an even better compromise. It's only round 4, and there's a good chance I can get a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John is an option, I'm optimistic that I can get a higher price from Bob with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,750 is closer, but I need to be at least $8,900 to make this work for me.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise Focus:** I emphasize the need for a compromise to push the price closer to my target.
* **Moderate Counter-Offer:** My counter-offer is only $150 higher than Bob's, showcasing a genuine willingness to meet halfway.
* **Urgency Implied:**  The message subtly implies that I'm willing to negotiate, but not for much longer."
