"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9500 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a compromise here!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  How about $8750? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8750 is closer, but I need to be at least $8900 to make this work for me.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close the deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
