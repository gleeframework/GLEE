"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident that this product will bring you a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
