Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident that this product will bring you a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? "", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob is unlikely to budge much higher, and it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to potentially waste more time negotiating with Bob for a smaller profit."
