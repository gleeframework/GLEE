Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth a lot, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low.  The value of this product is well above that. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  It's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a good price for the product. I think I can do better than that. I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
