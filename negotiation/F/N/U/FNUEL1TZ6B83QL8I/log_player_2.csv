"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:** Bob is making a significant counteroffer, showing Alice he's serious about getting a good deal. $8,500 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justifying the price:** Bob provides a reason for his offer, appealing to fairness and a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Showing interest:**  Bob expresses his interest in the product to keep the negotiation amicable."

```
