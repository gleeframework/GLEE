"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and your appreciation for it, I propose a price of $12,000. This offers a good balance between maximizing my earnings and providing you with a fair deal. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a cheaper price than $12,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which still leaves you with a healthy profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. Based on our previous discussion and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This allows you to stay within your budget while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget ($11,000 < $15,000).**
* **The offer is a good deal compared to buying from John.** 
* **While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small and the risk of losing the deal to John increases.** 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice for Bob."
