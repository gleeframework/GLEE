Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I've negotiated with Bob for a few rounds, but it seems like we're not getting close to a price that meets my minimum.  John is offering a price that is closer to my desired value for the product, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
