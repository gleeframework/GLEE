"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. This also gives me room to lower the price if needed in subsequent rounds. However, if Bob rejects my offer, I'm ready to walk away and sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I at least get my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $14,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I want to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good price for you considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value and condition of the product, I think $15,000 would be a fair price. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum desired value. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering my other option is to sell to John for the same amount. It's time to finalize the sale with Bob."
