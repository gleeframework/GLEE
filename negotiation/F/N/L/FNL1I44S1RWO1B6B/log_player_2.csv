Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? This is my maximum budget for this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13000 to make this deal work. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it still reflects the true value of this product.  Let's find a way to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This is a fair price that respects both our positions.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11500 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. This is a fair price that's within both of our ranges.  Let's finalize this deal and move on! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still above your comfort zone.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate further to see if you can reach a price closer to $11,500.  There are still several rounds left, so you have time to try and push for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but $12,500 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
