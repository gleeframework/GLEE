"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000? This is my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 10 rounds to close the deal and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or even John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it still reflects the true value of this product.  Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11500? This is a fair price that respects both our positions.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I have 6 more rounds to try and get a better price. There's a good chance Bob will come up a little more, and if not, John is always a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price that's within both of our ranges.  Let's finalize this deal and move on!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but $12500 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get a bit more, $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good outcome considering we're on round 6. I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is a reliable alternative."
