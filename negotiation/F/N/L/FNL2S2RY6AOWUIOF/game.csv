"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget is closer to $750,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go up to $750,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $820,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $775,000.  I'm hoping we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going up to $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose $795,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",795000.0,Alice,7,
