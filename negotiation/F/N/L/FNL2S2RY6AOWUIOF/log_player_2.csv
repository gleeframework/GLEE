Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going up to $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose $795,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Price:** $795,000 is a significant saving compared to John's $1,200,000 price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've been negotiating in smaller increments. It's unlikely we'll get a drastically better price from Alice without risking the deal.
* **Time:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Continuing increases the risk of Alice walking away."
