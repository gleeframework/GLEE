"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,300,000 to reflect the true value.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
