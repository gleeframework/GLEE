"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go to make a deal happen.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while keeping in mind your target price of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your desired price point.  You should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to your target of $1,000,000. There are still rounds left, so you can continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further step towards your target price, showing a continued commitment to negotiation.  It's a moderate decrease, so it doesn't seem too aggressive, but still pushes towards your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $1,100,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing too much profit, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your target price, but $1,150,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as there are still rounds remaining and there's a good chance you can get a better price.  You are clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has lowered her price significantly already, so there's potential for a final price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to see a path forward here.  How about $1,125,000? It's a good compromise, and gets us closer to a deal. I'm confident this product is worth it to me, and I'm ready to close this deal if you're willing to meet me here."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show a willingness to negotiate, while also demonstrating a commitment to the deal.  The price is a significant decrease from Alice's previous offer and is within a reasonable range for both parties.  This should encourage Alice to accept, but if she rejects, there are still rounds left to potentially find a price that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see we're getting close, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,130,000? This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,130,000 is closer to your target price of $1,000,000 than your previous counteroffer of $1,125,000. While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely you won't get a significantly lower price in the remaining rounds. Given that you have 3 rounds left and John's price is $1,200,000, it's a good decision to accept Alice's offer and close the deal."
