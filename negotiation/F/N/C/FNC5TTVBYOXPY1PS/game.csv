"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let's start with a fair deal, and we can work out the details from there.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? This gives you a substantial saving and me a fair price. Let's close the deal on this offer.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant saving for you compared to John's offer. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, but it's the absolute maximum I can offer. Let's close this deal on these terms.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $900,000 doesn't quite work for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $912,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied. Let's make this happen.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. While $912,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I can go up to $905,000, which is a fair compromise. This shows my commitment to finding a solution, but I can't go any higher. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further back-and-forth.",905000.0,Bob,6,
