"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident that we can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant saving for you compared to John's offer. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, but it's the absolute maximum I can offer. Let's close this deal on these terms. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round. I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $900,000 doesn't quite work for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $912,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 912500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. While $912,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I can go up to $905,000, which is a fair compromise. This shows my commitment to finding a solution, but I can't go any higher. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further back-and-forth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $905,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $905,000

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price,  $905,000 is very close to my desired price and a significant improvement over John's offer.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
