Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. It's a bit below what Bob is willing to pay, but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good chance of making a profit while also encouraging Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. It's still a good profit for me, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $115 is still a decent profit and better than selling to John. This is likely the best I'll get from Bob, so I'll accept his offer."
