Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe it undervalues certain unique aspects. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,500,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to go much higher than my initial counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product and I respect your commitment to finding a fair deal. Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my maximum price.  While I would prefer to pay less, it's a good deal considering my alternative option of buying from John for $1,200,000.  I'm accepting Alice's offer."
