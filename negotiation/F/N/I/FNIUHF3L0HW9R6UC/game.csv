"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be happy to discuss a price closer to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe it undervalues certain unique aspects. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,500,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,500,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product and I respect your commitment to finding a fair deal. Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a significant compromise that still recognizes the true worth of what I'm offering.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
