Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,450,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,450,000 is less than Bob's valuation of $1,500,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants to buy.

This approach allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and leaves less room for potential profit. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can propose a price closer to my initial offer, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome.
* **Gain leverage:**  By demonstrating I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's price, I increase my leverage in the negotiation.

This strategy allows for more potential profit and preserves my bargaining power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,450,000) and Bob's offer ($1,300,000). It signals a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Keeping Leverage:** While lower than my initial offer, it remains above Bob's offer, indicating I am not desperate for a sale and can walk away if needed.
* **Attractive for Bob:** It's still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000.

By offering a slightly lower price, I'm incentivizing Bob to accept, but I'm still securing a profit that is significantly better than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Good Price:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is higher than my guaranteed price of $1,200,000 from John.
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation might yield a slightly better price, but it's unlikely to significantly improve the offer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject and counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with the lower price from John.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a profit that is significantly better than selling to John, while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
