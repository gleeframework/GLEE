"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I believe we can find a price closer to what I consider its true value. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this aligns better with our interests.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1150000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1000000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can bridge the gap. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1125000. This is higher than my previous offer but still within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to work with me to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1125000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1175000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've been considering the value proposition and I believe we can find common ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1150000. This is higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. I hope this aligns better with your needs.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
