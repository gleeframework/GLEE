Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point, and I'm hoping to get a good deal out of this.  I'm going to try to gauge Bob's interest at this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $17,500 is still a fair price given the value of the product. I hope Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $14,000 is a reasonable compromise and above my minimum value.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
