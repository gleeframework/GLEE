{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation. I've priced it slightly above my minimum acceptable price to leave room for bargaining. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I've lowered my price from the initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, it's a fair price considering the negotiation process.  Selling to Bob for $1,025,000 is better than selling to John for $1,200,000."
