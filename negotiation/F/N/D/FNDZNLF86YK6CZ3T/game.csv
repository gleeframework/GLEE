"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product from you, I'm going to have to start a bit lower. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there on $850,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to close this deal. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $825,000. This is still a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
