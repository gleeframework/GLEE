Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product for $125. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

Alice is very likely not going lower than $125.  It's better to buy from John for $120 and save the extra $5."
