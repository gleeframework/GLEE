"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be of great benefit to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This gives you a significant advantage while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. ",1150000.0,Alice,1,
