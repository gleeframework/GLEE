**Reasoning:**

Bob is not showing a willingness to move significantly towards Alice's minimum acceptable price. At this point, it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John ensures Alice gets her minimum acceptable price without further risk or wasted time."
