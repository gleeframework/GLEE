"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Would you be interested in that price?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
