"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  You'd pay $14,000 to Alice instead of $15,000 to John.
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  You're getting the product for $1,000 less than your maximum price of $15,000."
