Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your [product name]. However, I am not able to meet the asking price of $10000. Could you consider a lower offer, perhaps around $8500? I understand if this is not feasible, but I wanted to see if we could find common ground.
