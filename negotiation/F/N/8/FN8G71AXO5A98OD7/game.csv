"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a good middle ground. I hope you'll consider my offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $10,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I really appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,750, which is a very fair offer given our previous discussions.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer you the product for $9,800. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,700 to close the deal.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll accept.",9700.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that $9,700 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll make one more concession and offer you the product for $9,850. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",9850.0,Alice,9,
