"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. How about we meet at $125? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
