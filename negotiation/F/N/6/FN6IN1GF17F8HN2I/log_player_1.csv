Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm aiming for a positive, collaborative tone to build a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not going to try to force a deal right away. This allows for negotiation and hopefully leads to a mutually agreeable outcome. 
* **Knowing my backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** Bob's offer of $90 is significantly better than John's offer of $80. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While $90 is not my ideal price, it's within a reasonable range. Accepting this offer gives me the opportunity to potentially negotiate further with Bob in the future. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer could lead to a stalemate or a protracted negotiation.  There's no guarantee that a counteroffer would be successful, and it could risk losing the deal entirely."
