"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This opening offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept it. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for my product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling it for $13,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $10500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I place on the product.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go lower than $12,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $10750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a price closer to my minimum from Bob. Even though John is only offering my minimum, it's a secure deal.  It's better to guarantee the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
