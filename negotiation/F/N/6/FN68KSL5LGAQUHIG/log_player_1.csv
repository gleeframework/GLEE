I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for potential negotiation and hopefully allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price point.  I'm willing to accept this offer as it still leaves me with a decent profit margin, and further negotiation may not lead to a significantly better outcome."
