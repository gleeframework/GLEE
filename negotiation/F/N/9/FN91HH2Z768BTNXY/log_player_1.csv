Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $8750.  This shows my commitment to buying from you, but it's the best I can offer at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer,  I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I have the option of selling to John for a better price.  I want to see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and come down to $8,900.
