"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and even above Alice's own valuation. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** While $800,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation. Alice might counter, and you can gradually increase your offer if needed,  while staying below your $1,000,000 maximum.
* **Alternative Option:** You always have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a fallback if negotiations with Alice fail to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a distance from what I have in mind. This product offers significant value, and to reflect that, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Over Budget:**  Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 remains above your $1,000,000 limit. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Although Alice hasn't met your price point, her counteroffer indicates a willingness to negotiate.  There's room to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **John as Backup:** Having John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net gives you leverage to continue negotiating with Alice without the risk of overpaying."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value while working within my budget."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's current offer ($1,300,000) and your previous offer ($800,000). 
* **Reaching a Compromise:**  This approach signals your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  Importantly,  $1,100,000 remains within your maximum budget while leaving some room for a final potential counter from Alice."
