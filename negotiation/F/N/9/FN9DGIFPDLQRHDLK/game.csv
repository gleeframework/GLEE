"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a distance from what I have in mind. This product offers significant value, and to reflect that, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value while working within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
