Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to land within a range that benefits you.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher value. Even though Bob's perceived value is lower, the initial high price might influence his counteroffer to be more favorable to me.
* **Leaving John as a Backup:** I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. I'm more comfortable walking away from a deal if it doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a distance from what I have in mind. This product offers significant value, and to reflect that, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've significantly reduced my initial price to show flexibility and signal a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Concession:** While the drop from $1,600,000 to $1,300,000 is substantial, it keeps me well above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I still have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage to push for a better offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value while working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for a bit more, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come up significantly from his initial offer.  
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation with further counteroffers carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal."
