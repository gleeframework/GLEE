{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than your maximum budget. It's always a good strategy to start by rejecting an initial offer that's too high and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating. 
* **Realistic Price:** $750,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential compromise without going too low. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone can help build rapport and encourage Alice to consider your offer."
