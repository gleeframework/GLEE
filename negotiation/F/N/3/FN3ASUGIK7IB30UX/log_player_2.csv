"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While $140 is close to my budget, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is motivated to sell, and I might be able to get a better price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling I'm serious about buying at a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is a bit too low for me, how about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice met me in the middle, and $125 is a solid price. It saves me a decent amount of money and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to me having to buy from John at full price."
