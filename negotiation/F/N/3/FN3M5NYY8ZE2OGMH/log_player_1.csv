Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a figure closer to my initial ask. How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I must stick to my budget. I've reviewed our previous discussions and believe that $900,000 is a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to move forward in a mutually beneficial way. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While John's offer is becoming more tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob.  Bob is clearly interested and incrementally increasing his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I really appreciate your flexibility. Based on our discussions, I believe $1,000,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price, and waiting carries the risk of him reducing his offer or me misjudging the remaining rounds. Taking the sure $1,000,000 now is the best decision."
