"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price still allows you to get a great deal, while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I'm open to continuing negotiations, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and try $11,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
