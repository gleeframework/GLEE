We'll increase our offer slightly, showing that we are serious about buying, but still try to keep it under $500,000. This should be more palatable to Alice while still leaving room for further negotiation."

Round 6

We're going to split the difference and see if Alice is willing to meet us halfway.  This shows we're serious about making a deal but also willing to be flexible."

Alice has come down significantly, and we are very close to our desired price point. It's likely we won't be able to get much lower, so accepting this offer seems like the best option."
