Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000 is a good starting point.**  It's a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it still leaves a good profit margin.
* **This offer is likely to be attractive to Bob.** He values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation, but he's likely to see this as a good deal.
* **It allows for potential counteroffers.** If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer, but I have the option to sell to John if I'm not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000.
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating.** I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option.** However, I'm not yet ready to give up on potentially getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with $10,500 shows flexibility.** It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **It's still a good profit for me.** This price is above Bob's initial valuation but still leaves me with a decent profit.
* **This could be a good negotiation point.** Bob may be willing to meet me halfway to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000.
* **Negotiating further might lead to a stalemate.** Bob seems unwilling to significantly increase his offer.
* **Selling to John guarantees my desired profit.** This is the safest and most lucrative option at this point.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether."
