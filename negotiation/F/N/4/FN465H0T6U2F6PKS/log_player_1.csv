Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is significantly less than the $1,500,000 value Bob places on the product. 
* **It's a strong opening:** This shows you're confident in your product's worth and sets a solid foundation for negotiation.

This offer leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer while still giving you a substantial profit.  You can then use his counteroffer to decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer.  By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, you can:

* **Show your commitment to a higher price:** It demonstrates you're not willing to settle for a significantly lower amount.
* **Maintain leverage:** It allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired amount. 

You can now make a counteroffer to Bob that is somewhere between $1,000,000 and your initial offer of $1,200,000. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize your profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a great deal and me a solid profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  It's a compromise from your initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Keeps the price above your minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still comfortably above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you a substantial profit.
* **Highlights the value for both parties:**  It emphasizes that this price would be a win for both of you. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is appealing to both of you. By staying firm on your minimum while showing flexibility, you increase your chances of securing a favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,100,000. How about we try $1,050,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation:

* **Above your minimum:** $1,050,000 is significantly above your minimum of $800,000, securing you a considerable profit.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob claims this is his final offer, there's always a chance you could negotiate further if you reject it. However, the risk is that he might walk away from the deal.
* **Avoiding the risk of John:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed profit, but it's lower than what Bob is offering. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you're securing a favorable deal while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
