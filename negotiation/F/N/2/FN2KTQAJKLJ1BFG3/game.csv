"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  The product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can generate a strong return for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price still allows you a substantial profit while ensuring I receive a fair compensation for my product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial sum and reflects my serious interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to reflect your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return for this valuable product. This price is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
