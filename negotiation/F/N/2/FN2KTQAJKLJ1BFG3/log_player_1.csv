Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I've highlighted the potential value of the product for Bob's business.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but this initial offer establishes a strong starting point. 

**Strategy:** 

* I'm willing to accept a price between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000, as this range ensures I'm earning more than what John is offering.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my subsequent counteroffers accordingly.
* If negotiations stall or Bob makes an unacceptable offer, I can always fall back on John's $1,500,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Better outcome potential:** I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise. I'll try to understand why Bob is offering so low and address those concerns."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  The product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can generate a strong return for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price still allows you a substantial profit while ensuring I receive a fair compensation for my product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value and potential return of the product to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:**  The price of $900,000 presents a clear middle ground, making it easier for Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping to reach a deal within this round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reconsider my strategy and potentially reduce my price slightly. 
* If negotiations continue, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net.
* I'll carefully assess Bob's response and adjust my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial sum and reflects my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $700,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's serious about buying the product.
* **Potential for a better price:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and secure a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming to find a middle ground. I'll try to understand why Bob is still reluctant to increase his offer and address those concerns. I'll be prepared to reduce my counteroffer slightly, but I won't go below $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to reflect your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return for this valuable product. This price is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's latest offer ($700,000), showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value and the fact that I'm making a significant discount.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm phrasing this counteroffer as a final attempt to reach an agreement, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Goal:** I'm aiming to secure a deal for $850,000. This is a significant price reduction, but it's still within my acceptable range.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000. I may be willing to go down slightly further, but not significantly.
* **Time is of the essence:** I'll continue to emphasize the time sensitivity of the deal, encouraging Bob to make a decision."
