Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already making a profit of $200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob still has a potential gain of $200,000, making it likely he'll counteroffer.
* **It's a clear signal of your value:** You're not undervaluing your product, but you're also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested, but could we bring the price down a bit? How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than the $1,000,000 you offered. You have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum price with John ($800,000) and  only $50,000 less than your last offer.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving you with the lower offer from John. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids potential risk."
