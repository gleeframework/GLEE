"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price. It's always beneficial to try to get a better deal if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10,500? That would still leave you with a profit, and would be a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a little less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10800. This is a great compromise that still leaves me with a good profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is a good compromise.  Bob can save $200 compared to buying from John, and while it's not the absolute lowest price, it's still a significant saving and worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
