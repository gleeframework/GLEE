Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. This also gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar at a lower price. I am willing to pay $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
