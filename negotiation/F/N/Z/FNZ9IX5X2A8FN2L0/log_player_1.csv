Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down to a price that's still good for me while ensuring I'm not undervaluing my product. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and potentially even go lower if needed, but I won't go below my floor price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm confident that I can negotiate a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $975,000, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but it still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my floor price, I'm not yet willing to settle for that amount. I'm confident that I can get a slightly higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $950,000, which is exactly Bob's last offer. This shows him I'm serious about making a deal and I'm willing to meet him halfway. Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair price and accept. If he rejects again, I might be willing to drop to my floor price of $800,000, but I'll try to avoid selling to John if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob seems to be determined to get a lower price, and I'm starting to worry that I won't be able to reach a deal with him before I lose too much time. Selling to John at $800,000 will still give me a significant profit, and it's better than potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
