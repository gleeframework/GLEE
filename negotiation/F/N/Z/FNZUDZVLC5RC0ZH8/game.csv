"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go down to $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I understand your position, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in talks, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
