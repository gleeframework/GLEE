"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is going to start by making his absolute best offer.  This is the maximum he's willing to pay, and hopefully, it will be a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get the price down further, or failing that, Bob can still purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a slightly higher offer than his maximum budget.  This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but still trying to save as much as possible.  This is a good strategy to hopefully get Alice to meet him halfway."
