Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that I can get $15,000 from John, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Bob might be willing to pay a little more than $8,000 to avoid losing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows his willingness to negotiate. I believe I can still get a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I want to maximize my earnings. By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My previous offer of $14,000 was rejected, so I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $12,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $8,000 and above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Upside:** While Bob has increased his offer to $9,000, there's still limited room for negotiation. The difference between his offer and my desired price is significant.
* **Time and Risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially getting stuck in a loop of counteroffers without a favorable outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with my goal of maximizing earnings.

By choosing to sell to John, I avoid further negotiation and secure a guaranteed, profitable transaction."
