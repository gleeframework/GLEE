"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price around $200 to start. What are your thoughts?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be comfortable paying $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However, $200 is quite a drop. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I'm confident it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm really set on a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $125?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $125 is closer to your budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference again and settle on $150? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
