"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price around $200 to start. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum price of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be comfortable paying $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, $200 is quite a drop. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I'm confident it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my limit of $100.  I'll continue to negotiate in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm really set on a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $125?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $125 is closer to your budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference again and settle on $150? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is still above my limit. While we're getting closer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'd rather buy from John at $100 and secure the product without the risk of further haggling."
