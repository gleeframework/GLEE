"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to work within a budget.  While your offer is appreciated, the $750,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budgetary constraints, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I must respectfully decline at $900,000. I am aiming for a price closer to $800,000 to align better with my financial goals. Would you be willing to negotiate further?",800000.0,Bob,4,
