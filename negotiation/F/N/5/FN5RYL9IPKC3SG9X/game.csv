"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers you a lot of value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more fair. How about $11,000? This feels like a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this compromise?",10500.0,Bob,4,
