Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product has equal value to both Alice and Bob ($1,500,000), and Alice has a backup offer, she can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value to Bob specifically, Alice aims to make the price feel more justified than a random high number.
* **Time pressure and competition:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

By setting the initial offer at $2,000,000, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still leaving a reasonable chance that Bob will accept."
