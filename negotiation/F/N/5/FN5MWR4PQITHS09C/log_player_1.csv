``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting close to my minimum, but Bob's offers are still too low. It's better to guarantee the $15,000 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
