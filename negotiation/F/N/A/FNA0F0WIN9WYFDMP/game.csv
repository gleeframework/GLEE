"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,800 is simply too low for me to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,400.  This price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirement.  What do you say?",10400.0,Alice,3,
