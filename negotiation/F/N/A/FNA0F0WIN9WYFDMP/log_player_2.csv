"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,800 is simply too low for me to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,400.  This price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirement.  What do you say?
