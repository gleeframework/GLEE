"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $13,500 is still a bit high for him, considering he values the product at $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to work with me on that?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer.  $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a price that fits his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?  This product is genuinely valuable and I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit high. Bob is determined to save as much money as possible, and he knows he has more negotiating room. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $12,250 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,625?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 11625}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a lower price, but he's also acknowledging Alice's position and showing a willingness to compromise. Offering $11,625 is a reasonable counteroffer that splits the difference between his previous offer and Alice's. This demonstrates a commitment to finding a solution while remaining within his budget."
