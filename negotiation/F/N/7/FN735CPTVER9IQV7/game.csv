"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to work with me on that?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?  This product is genuinely valuable and I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $12,250 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,625?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal.",11625.0,Bob,4,
