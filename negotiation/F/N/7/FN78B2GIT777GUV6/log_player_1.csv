Round 2
Bob's offer:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $9,250. I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to counter with an offer of $9,100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price of $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,100 is only $900 less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's a good deal considering we're only in Round 4."
