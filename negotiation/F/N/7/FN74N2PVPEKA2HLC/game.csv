"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1100000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach my minimum target. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1200000. This is as high as I'm willing to go.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1200000 is still below my minimum target. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at my minimum price of $1500000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
