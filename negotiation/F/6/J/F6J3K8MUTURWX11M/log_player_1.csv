Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in very small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
