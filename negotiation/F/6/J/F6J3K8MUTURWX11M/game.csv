"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it for a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $17,000. This is a very fair price considering the benefits it offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more than I'm willing to pay, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll try to compromise at $11,000. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $12,500. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on a price.",12500.0,Bob,6,
