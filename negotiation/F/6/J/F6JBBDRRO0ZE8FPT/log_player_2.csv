"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product has a significant value to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $925000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your initial offer and my own value for the product.

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still higher than what Bob is comfortable with. While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy."

```

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $906,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $910000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** This is Round 9, and Bob only has one more round to make a deal with Alice. 
* **Little Room for Negotiation:** While Alice is offering a lower price, it's still above what Bob is comfortable with.
* **Jhon's Offer:**  Bob knows he can buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000. This is a high price, but it's a guaranteed deal.

**Conclusion:**

It's not guaranteed that Alice will accept Bob's counteroffer in the final round.  Given the time pressure and the possibility of a better deal with Jhon, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the certainty of Jhon's offer and walk away from the negotiation with Alice."
