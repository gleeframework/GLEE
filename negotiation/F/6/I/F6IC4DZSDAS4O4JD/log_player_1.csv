Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit, but staying below John's offer to keep Bob interested.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though Bob values it less.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals flexibility and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer.  This allows me to potentially secure a deal above my minimum while still having John as a backup."
