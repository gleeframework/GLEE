"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $110. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $85 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $95 is better than $110, Bob is still able to get the product for cheaper from John.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $85.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to $85, but I'm really at my limit with that price. I'm willing to go down to $90, but I can't go any lower.  This is a great deal for you, so let's close this out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down to $90, but Bob can still get the product from John for $80.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice as Bob will always be able to get the product for a better price from John."
