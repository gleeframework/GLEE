"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still reasonable for you. How about $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1100000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $1100000. How about $975000?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900000, which represents a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I think this price is reasonable and fair for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,7,
