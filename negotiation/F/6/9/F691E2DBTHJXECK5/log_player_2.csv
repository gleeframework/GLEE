{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $3000 lower than Alice's initial price. This is a significant discount, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product is worth $10,000 to me and I'm aiming for the best possible deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, although it's closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to reach a price closer to my target. There are still rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still below Alice's current offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a good price. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, even though it's closer. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if we can reach a price that's within my target range. There's still a chance I can get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:** This is my final offer. It's my maximum budget and I believe it's a fair price considering the product is worth $10,000 to both of us. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll move on to John and buy the product from him."
