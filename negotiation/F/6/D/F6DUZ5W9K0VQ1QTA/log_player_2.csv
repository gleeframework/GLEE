{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,000, which is still a good deal for Alice considering her minimum price is $12,000. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is still above my maximum budget.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $9,250, which is halfway between my previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $9,750. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,875 is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still too high.  With only 5 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a lower price.  It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $10,000 and guarantee a purchase within my budget."
