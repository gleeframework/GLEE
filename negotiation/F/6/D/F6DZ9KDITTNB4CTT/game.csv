,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I'm confident this price still offers great value for you and allows me to recover a fair amount for my product.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget constraints, Alice. While $10,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still believe we can reach an agreement that suits both of us better. Would it be possible to lower the price to $10,500? This would allow me to stay within my budget while also compensating you fairly for your product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and understanding. While I'm willing to compromise, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,600, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and avoid further back and forth.",10600.0,Alice,5,
