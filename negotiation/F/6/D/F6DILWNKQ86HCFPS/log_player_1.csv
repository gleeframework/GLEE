Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim for a price higher than John's offer ($12,000) to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Start with a strong offer ($11,500) that leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays of finding another buyer.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John immediately."
