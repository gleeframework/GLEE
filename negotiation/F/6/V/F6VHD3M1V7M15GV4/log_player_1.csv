"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, knowing it's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to him, hoping to incentivize him to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm making it clear I'm willing to discuss the price further. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  Bob clearly values the product at $15,000, so there's still room for a compromise closer to my initial offer. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a better price than selling to someone else. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with reason:** I'm not just rejecting Bob's offer, I'm providing a counter-argument and proposing a compromise.
* **Highlighting value for both:** I'm reminding Bob that $12,000 is still a good deal for him, while also emphasizing it's a better outcome for me than selling to John.
* **Staying firm but open to negotiation:**  I'm showing that I'm not going to give in completely, but I'm also open to finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $11,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd still like more, we are nearing the end of the rounds and the risk of losing the sale to John is increasing.  $11,500 is a good deal for me, and it avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
