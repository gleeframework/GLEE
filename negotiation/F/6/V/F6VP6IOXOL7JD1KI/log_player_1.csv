"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product's worth to me ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($1,000,000), I'm starting high to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, signaling my willingness to negotiate but also aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Positive framing:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob's perspective, aiming to initiate a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. 

I'll aim for a counteroffer that bridges the gap but keeps the negotiation moving in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value.  While $1,200,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  This reflects the true value of what the product offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:**  I want to keep the negotiation friendly and collaborative, so I acknowledge his offer and his understanding of the product's value. 
* **Significant but strategic reduction:** I've reduced my price by $300,000, which is a significant concession but still keeps the price well above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair reflection of the product's value, aiming to anchor Bob's perception around a higher price point. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this counteroffer is closer to my starting price, it leaves room for further negotiation in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,900,000 remains outside of my financial capacity.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could drag on, potentially causing me to miss out on selling to John. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
