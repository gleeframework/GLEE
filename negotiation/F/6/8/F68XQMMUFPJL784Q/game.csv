"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for a product worth so much. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but no more. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,6,
