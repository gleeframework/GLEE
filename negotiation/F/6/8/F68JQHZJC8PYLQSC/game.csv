"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Plus, it's a fair price for me considering its worth to me is $1,500,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my comfortable range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a significant amount for me and ensures a good return on your investment. Let's find a way to make this deal work for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $975,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and it's a fair price for me considering its worth to me is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise. While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $925,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $950,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and it's a fair price for me considering its worth to me is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $937,500. This is a fair compromise that splits the difference between our last offers.  It's a good deal for both of us and will allow us to finalize this transaction.",937500.0,Bob,8,
