"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still a bit high. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to see how much negotiating room there is. I'm aiming to get the price closer to her value of $100 while staying well below my $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit high, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met me halfway, and $105 is a reasonable price. It's close enough to my target, and it's not worth the risk of her retracting the offer or further negotiation potentially raising the price."
