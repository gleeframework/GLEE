,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 130 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try 115? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking with my offer of $105. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of 105, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. How about we try to find a compromise? I'm willing to meet you at 110. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $107. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll be purchasing from John.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for 107. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet at 112? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",112.0,Alice,7,
