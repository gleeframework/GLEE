Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of 105, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. How about we try to find a compromise? I'm willing to meet you at 110. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product.

You're still aiming for $105, and Alice is offering $110. It's getting closer to your target, but you should continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $107. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll be purchasing from John."", ""product_price"": 107}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for 107. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet at 112? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is offering $112, which is still more than your target of $105.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $100.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price."
