"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential ROI for you. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $600,000 is considerably below its true worth.  I could consider a price of $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While the product is good, $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
