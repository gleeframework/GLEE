"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum price, as I have another option available for that amount. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,550,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a good deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
