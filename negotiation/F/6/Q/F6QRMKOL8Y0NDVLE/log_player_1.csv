Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $15,000 to me, and I can sell it to John for that price. Bob's offer of $12,000 is not acceptable. I will try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $15,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm not willing to accept $13,500 for the product yet.  It's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,500 just isn't enough for me to sell this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $14,500. I think we're getting close, but I still need to save as much as possible. How about $14,000? That's the absolute highest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid the risk of a further decrease in price or a failed negotiation."
