Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and using positive language to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves enough room for potential counteroffers without jeopardizing my minimum requirement.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a sale above my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counter-counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He's shown interest and a willingness to pay more than his initial offer, which means there's potential for a higher counteroffer from him. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  While selling to John would guarantee $15,000, the potential to earn more from Bob makes it worthwhile to continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the unique value of the product, justifying the price.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language and framing the offer as a win-win situation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've successfully negotiated a sale above my minimum.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am unable to meet the price of $11500. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11000. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might end up with a lower offer or even have to sell to John at a price I'm not entirely satisfied with.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation might take more time and effort without a guarantee of a significantly better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal, securing a profit."
