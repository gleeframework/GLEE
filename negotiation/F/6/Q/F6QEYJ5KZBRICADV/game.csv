"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $7,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go below $7,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,200 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $6,900? This is a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",6900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $7,000. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer it to you for $7,100. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",7100.0,Alice,7,
