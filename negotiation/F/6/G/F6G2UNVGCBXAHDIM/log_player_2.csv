"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's worth trying to negotiate lower. Since you have a fallback option with John, there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and incentivizes her to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. It's unlikely I can get much lower, especially with John's offer as a backup. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
