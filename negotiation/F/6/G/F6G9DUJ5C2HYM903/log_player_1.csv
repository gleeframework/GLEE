Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,300,000. This represents a great deal, given the product's value to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $1150000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price and meets my goal of earning at least that amount for the product.  There's no guarantee I can get a higher price in further rounds, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the sale and avoid potential complications."
