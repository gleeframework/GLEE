Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to maximize my potential earnings.  However, I'm also mindful of John's offer of $1,500,000, which provides a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to get the best price possible, $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I will not settle for a price so far below my minimum acceptable value.  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable value, but I've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to pay more.  I've already established that I'm not willing to go lower. Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risk losing more time and potentially lowering the price further, I'm going to accept John's offer. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable value, and it allows me to move on to other opportunities."
