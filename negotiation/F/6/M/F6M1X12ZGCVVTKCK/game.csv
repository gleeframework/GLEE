"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly valuable product. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. My initial price is $1500000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's potential. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm also aware of its immense worth, so I won't be accepting anything too far below that figure. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1500000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in acquiring this product, but I can't justify that price. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial valuation.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000?  This would still represent a significant benefit for you and allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $975000. This represents a significant investment for me and would be a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $975000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $1025000? This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. It's just a small step up from your offer, but it would make a big difference for me.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a higher price, but $1025000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $990000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can find common ground at this price. Let's finalize this deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
