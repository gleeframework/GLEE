"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice's initial offer is at your limit, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer ($20 less than Alice's initial price)  shows you're serious about getting a good deal. This also gives Alice room to counter if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can offer you a compromise - how about $110? It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a good compromise.  It's better to accept the offer now rather than risking a further counteroffer from Alice that might be higher.  You've saved $10 compared to John's price, and you've still got 7 rounds left if you need to negotiate with other sellers later."
