"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a significant markup over my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll see what counteroffer I can get from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm offering $190. This is a compromise, but still gives me a profit margin while hopefully being more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's only $10 below my initial offer, I still want to see if I can get a bit closer to my target price.  I'm not too worried about losing the deal yet, as I still have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 185}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $185.  This is a small compromise from my last offer, but I'm hoping it'll be enough to sway Bob towards accepting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $165 is only $15 away from my minimum, I'm going to try to get a bit more. I still have several rounds left and I don't want to sell too cheaply.  I'm hopeful that I can get a better offer from Bob or at least a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $175. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, but I'm getting closer to Bob's price range. I'm hoping that he sees this as a sign of good faith and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm hoping that I can get a bit more in the remaining two rounds.  I don't want to rush into selling for a price that I'm not completely comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. I'm offering $165, which is a small compromise from Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway and that he'll accept.  If not, I'll have to decide whether to accept his next offer or sell to John in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the final round, and while I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $155 is only $5 below my minimum.  I'm not sure if he'll counter again, and selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome.  It's better to secure the sale with Bob at this point."
