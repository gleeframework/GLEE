Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $15,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:**  I want to maximize profit, and this gives me room to negotiate.
* **It's not unreasonable:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, but it's possible he values the product at a level that would make this price acceptable.

By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'm starting strong!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round. 

Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While I'm happy to get $12,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **I want to see if I can do better:** It's possible Bob is willing to pay more.  By rejecting, I can gauge his true interest level and potentially push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John, so there's no risk in pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob with a price of $13,500. Here's my reasoning:

* **Compromise:** This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Still above my minimum:** It's still above my minimum of $12,000, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This price will help me understand how seriously Bob is interested. If he's really set on $12,000, he'll likely reject this offer, and I'll know it's time to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to **SellToJhon** for $12,000. 

Here's why:

* **No further negotiation:**  Bob is firm on his price of $12,000, and I've already made a counteroffer.  There's no indication he's willing to budge.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially getting nothing more than my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is my minimum and a decent outcome considering Bob's stubbornness. 

I'm happy with this decision. While I initially hoped for a higher price, I'm realistic about the situation and prioritizing a secure outcome over prolonging the negotiation."
