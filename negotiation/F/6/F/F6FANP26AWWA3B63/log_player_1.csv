Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,400,000 puts Bob in a strong position to benefit. He gains $400,000 in value ($1,400,000 offer vs. his $1,000,000 valuation).
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other buyers and a limited-time offer, I'm adding pressure for Bob to make a decision quickly.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price by leveraging Bob's perceived value and creating a sense of urgency."
