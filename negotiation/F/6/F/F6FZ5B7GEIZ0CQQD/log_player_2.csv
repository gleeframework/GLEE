# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value to you is around $100. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $110. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring a fair deal for both parties.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
