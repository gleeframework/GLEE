Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
