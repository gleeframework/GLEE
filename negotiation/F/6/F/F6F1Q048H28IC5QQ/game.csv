"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, I'm only willing to pay $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, as it's below my maximum value and above your minimum. Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
