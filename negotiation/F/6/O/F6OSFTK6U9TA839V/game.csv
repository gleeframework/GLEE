"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your number. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to meet you at $13,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,7,
