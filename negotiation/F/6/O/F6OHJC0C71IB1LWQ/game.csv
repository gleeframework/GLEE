"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a good deal for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
