"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice saves you $100,000:** You would pay $900,000 instead of $1,000,000 from John. 
* **It's still a good deal for you:** You are paying less than the product is worth to you ($1,000,000)."
