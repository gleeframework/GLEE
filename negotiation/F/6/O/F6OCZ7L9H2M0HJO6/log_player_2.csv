Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, Alice's offer is within Bob's budget. While it's not the absolute lowest price, continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
