"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it's a valuable asset that could be very beneficial to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,000,000 is his absolute maximum, it's best to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential value in your product,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  A 25% reduction is a significant discount but still shows Bob is interested in the product.
* **Sets the tone for negotiation:** This counteroffer establishes a clear expectation that Bob will push for a lower price. 
* **Room for compromise:**  $750,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential middle ground with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $750000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about we split the difference at $875000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is already compromising:** Alice has moved from $1,000,000 to $875,000, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **There's still room for a better deal:**  Bob is aiming for a lower price and can likely push for a better offer. 
* **Staying in the game:**  By rejecting, Bob continues to exert pressure and demonstrate he's not willing to settle for the current price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach a deal.  "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a firm but reasonable stance:**  Bob is pushing for a lower price but still offering a significant increase from his previous offer. 
* **Playing the middle ground:**  $800,000 is halfway between Bob's last offer and Alice's current offer, making it a logical compromise point.
* **Showing flexibility:**  By offering a higher price, Bob shows Alice that he's serious about the deal and willing to be flexible."
