Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a valuable asset that could be very beneficial to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential value in your product,  $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about we split the difference at $875,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach a deal.   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the same price John is offering.  There's no benefit to continue negotiating, as I'm not likely to get a higher price from Bob.  Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal quickly and get the best possible price."
