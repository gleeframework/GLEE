Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" aiming to justify the higher price. 
* **Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $1,200,000. This gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer.  His perception of the product's market value will influence his decision.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to potentially negotiate down from your initial offer. Observe Bob's reactions and adjust accordingly."
