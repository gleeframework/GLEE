Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe would be valuable to you for $11,999.  I think you'll find it's a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, your goal is to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale creates a strong anchor in Bob's mind. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While the price is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, making him feel more in control.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob without revealing your own minimum price.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a high likelihood of a sale."
