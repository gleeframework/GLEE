"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit far off.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move on with this sale.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $13,250 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,500 is too high. How about we try $12,000? That's the price I was initially considering, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,4,
