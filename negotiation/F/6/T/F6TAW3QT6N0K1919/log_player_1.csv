"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit far off.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move on with this sale."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $13,250 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,500 is too high. How about we try $12,000? That's the price I was initially considering, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly what John is willing to pay.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob when I can sell the product to John immediately for the same price."
