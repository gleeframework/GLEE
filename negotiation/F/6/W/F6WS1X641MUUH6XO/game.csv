"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $900,000.  This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Alice,5,
