Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1750000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but $1400000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000 as a final compromise. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, $1,600,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob has a solid backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into an agreement at this point.  Bob can continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
