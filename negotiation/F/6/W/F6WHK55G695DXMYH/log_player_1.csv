Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This gives us room to negotiate, but also signals my seriousness about achieving a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent sum, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to show flexibility but still holding firm at a price that's closer to my desired value. This counteroffer should incentivize Bob to come up with a higher offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. It's clear he's not going to budge much further. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price,  $1,500,000 from John guarantees me a sale at my minimum value.  It's time to move on and secure the deal."
