"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it, given its market value and my own assessment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $600,000 is considerably below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'm proposing $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $750,000 is still too low for me to accept.  How about $850,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",825000.0,Bob,6,
