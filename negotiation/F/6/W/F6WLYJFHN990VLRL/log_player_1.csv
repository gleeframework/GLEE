"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's value (""significant value,"" ""your expertise,"" ""its potential"") I'm providing a rationale for the high initial offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is framed as an ""initial proposal,"" signaling openness to further discussion and potential price adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it, given its market value and my own assessment.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his stated valuation of the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage him to come closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $600,000 is considerably below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'm proposing $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** While rejecting Bob's low offer, I maintain a polite and professional tone. 
* **Highlighting the Gap:**  I'm emphasizing that his offer is significantly below what I consider acceptable.
* **Strategic Concession:** I've come down $100,000 from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to support the higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for him to increase his offer further, especially since he stated his valuation is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $750,000 is still too low for me to accept.  How about $850,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I want Bob to know I see and appreciate his movement towards a compromise.
* **Final Concession (for now):**  This offer is a significant drop from my previous counteroffer and only $50,000 above my bottom line. It signals that I'm getting close to my limit.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value and that my price is fair.
* **Urgency:** By not making large concessions anymore, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to close the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and I risk him walking away. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
