"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your initial offer, I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'm thinking $850,000 would be a good starting point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a bit too high at $875,000. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $862,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $862,500. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value this product brings to the table. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate you continuing to work with me. I see we're getting closer. While $880,000 is a good price,  I'm still hoping for a slightly lower figure. I'm prepared to offer $870,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $885,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.
