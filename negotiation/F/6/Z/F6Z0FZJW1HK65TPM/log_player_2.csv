"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible and $900,000 is still above your desired price range.
* **Negotiation is key.**  You have 10 rounds and the ability to counteroffer, so you can try to get a better deal.
* **John is a backup option.**  While buying from John for $1,000,000 is a possibility, you want to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your initial offer, I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'm thinking $850,000 would be a good starting point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message highlights your willingness to work towards a deal while making it clear that you want a lower price. 
* **Sets the stage:** This counteroffer establishes a clear starting point for future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your target price, you want to try and get it even lower. 
* **Negotiation is still beneficial.**  With several rounds left, you can continue to press for a better price. 
* **John remains a fallback option.**  Even though you're getting closer to your target, you don't want to settle prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a bit too high at $875,000. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $862,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's last offer. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the desire to close the deal quickly, suggesting you might walk away if this offer isn't accepted.
* **Fairness:**  The counteroffer is framed as a fair price for both parties, increasing the chances of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $862,500. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value this product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's getting closer to your target price, you have several rounds left and can likely get it lower.
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile.**  You're already a significant distance closer to your goal than when you started, and further negotiation could save you more money.
* **John is still a fallback option.**  It's important to keep in mind that you can always buy from John if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you continuing to work with me. I see we're getting closer. While $880,000 is a good price,  I'm still hoping for a slightly lower figure. I'm prepared to offer $870,000. This is my final offer before considering other options."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message clearly communicates that this is your last counteroffer, creating pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:** It shows willingness to compromise by increasing your offer slightly, but still staying within your desired range.
* **Alternative Options:**  The message subtly reminds Alice that you have other choices (John) if an agreement isn't reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $885,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to your goal:**  Alice's offer is only $85,000 above your desired price range, which is a significant improvement from the initial offer.
* **Final offer:**  Alice has stated that this is her final offer, making it less likely that she'll come down further. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only a few rounds remaining, you're at risk of running out of time if you keep rejecting offers.
* **John's offer:**  While John offers a ""safe"" option, accepting Alice's offer would save you $115,000.

**At this point, it's a calculated risk.  You're close to your goal, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also carries the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to settle for John's higher price.**"
