Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to bargain and creates the perception of value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $14,000, you signal that you're willing to negotiate while staying well above your $12,000 baseline.
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values the product at $10,000, he might be willing to go higher if he perceives the product as valuable and your offer as reasonable. 

This is just the opening move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still below your minimum. You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** You're lowering your price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This counteroffer is still $500 above your minimum acceptable price and halfway between your initial offer and Bob's.
* **Highlighting Value:**  You're reiterating the product's value to justify the price and potentially nudge Bob closer to your target."
