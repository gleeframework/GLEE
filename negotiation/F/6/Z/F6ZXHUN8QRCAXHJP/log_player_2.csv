"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150.** You want to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.**  
* **Buying from John is a last resort, as it's the most expensive option.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive First Counteroffer:**  Starting with a lower offer helps set the tone for negotiation and increases the chance of finding a middle ground. 
* **Reasonable Justification:**  Providing a reason for your offer (being a bit high) makes it more persuasive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $100 leaves space for Alice to counter without making the deal too unfavorable for either party."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price point.** While it's closer, it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.
* **Continuing negotiation has the potential for a better deal.**  You've shown you're willing to negotiate and Alice has adjusted her price, so there's a good chance you can get to a more agreeable number.
* **Buying from John remains a last resort, as it's the most expensive option.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $110 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $105?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  Offers a price that is halfway between your last offer ($100) and Alice's offer ($110). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning and Justification:**  Reiterates the desire to find a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintains a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
