Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and makes it more appealing to Bob.  He might be willing to pay a bit more than its actual worth to him ($80) if he believes it's a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting high leaves you room to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob counters, still ensuring you make more than your minimum."
