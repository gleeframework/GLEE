Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  The price is significantly lower than what Bob values the product at, making it a good deal for him. This increases his likelihood of accepting.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob makes a counteroffer, you still have some space to negotiate a price that's favorable for you. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and how the negotiation progresses."
