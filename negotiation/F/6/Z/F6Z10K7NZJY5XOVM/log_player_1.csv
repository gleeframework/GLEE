Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point,  giving me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still higher than what I'd get from John. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to close the gap and make a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still higher than what I'd get from John. It's a decent price, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will lead to a significantly higher price. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
