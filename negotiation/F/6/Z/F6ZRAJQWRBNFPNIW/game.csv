"Bob, I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1075000.

"Bob, I can see you're determined to get a good deal. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I'm not going to go below $1070000. I'm going to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which is $1067500. This is my final concession, and I expect you to take it seriously. What do you think?",1067500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think you're not serious about making a deal. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1067500. I'm going to take a firmer stance now. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1065000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1065000.0,Alice,9,
