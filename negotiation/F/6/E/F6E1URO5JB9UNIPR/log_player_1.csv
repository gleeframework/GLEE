Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This allows for room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a friendly and positive message to build rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can secure at least my minimum price if Bob isn't interested."
