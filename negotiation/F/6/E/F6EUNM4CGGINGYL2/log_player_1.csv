Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you consider a lower price closer to that?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $6,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.
