Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. However, I know Bob is only willing to pay $100.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer. It's unlikely he'll accept $140 outright, but it keeps the conversation open.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $150. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
