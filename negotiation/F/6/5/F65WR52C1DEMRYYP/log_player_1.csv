"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product to you.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not unrealistically so):** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly implies the price is justified and encourages Bob to consider the product's benefits beyond his initial valuation. 
* **Leaving John as Leverage:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob above this price is preferable. I'll keep John as a backup plan if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. I have room to negotiate and I'm willing to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer ($2,300,000 to $1,900,000) to show Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. 
* **Above Minimum:** It's important to note that my counteroffer remains comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), ensuring I'm still aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By positioning this as an attempt to ""find a middle ground,"" I'm subtly encouraging Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk him lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
