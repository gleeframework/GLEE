"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
