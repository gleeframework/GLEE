"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000 to start negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is $1,000,000, starting significantly lower than my own minimum ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value to me.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 allows for a potential compromise while still securing a profit. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to his maximum valuation, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,150,000 at this stage.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter with an offer slightly above his to see if he's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I believe $1,140,000 is a fair reflection of the product's value. It's a small concession for a truly exceptional asset."",
""product_price"": 1140000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Concession:**  I'm lowering my price by $10,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying firm above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's exceptional qualities to subtly remind Bob of its worth and justify the price. 
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much further Bob is willing to go and how close we are to reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some further thought, Alice. I would like to propose an offer of $1,120,000 for the product. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close, but I believe I can still get a slightly better deal.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. I'll hold firm for one more round to test his resolve and see if I can push closer to $1,130,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,130,000?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price for such a high-quality product."",
""product_price"": 1130000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer represents a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,120,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,140,000). 
* **Finality:** By phrasing it as ""splitting the difference,"" I'm subtly indicating a desire to finalize the deal around this price point.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to reinforce its value and justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. In light of this, I would like to propose an offer of $1,110,000 for the product. I hope this meets within your expectations and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer is moving too slowly.  While he is still engaging, the increments are getting smaller, and he's still significantly below my $1,130,000 target.  With the risk of his offer decreasing further in subsequent rounds, it's in my best interest to cut my losses and accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation and potential for a lower offer from Bob."
