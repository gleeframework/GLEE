Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with a price of $12,000, aiming for a higher profit margin. This price is likely to be attractive to Bob as it's still below his perceived value of the product. However, I'm prepared to negotiate and potentially go lower if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe there's still some room for negotiation, and I'm willing to engage in another round to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It still allows me to make a decent profit while also being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, the negotiation is taking longer than I anticipated. To avoid further delays and ensure I get a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, I'll sell the product to John."
