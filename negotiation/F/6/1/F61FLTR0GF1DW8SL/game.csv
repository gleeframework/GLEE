,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is beyond my budget. Given my valuation of the product, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while leaving some room for negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my part and is a very attractive price for a product of this caliber.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. This price is a fair reflection of the value I see in the product and leaves some room for further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I see that you recognize the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $890,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
