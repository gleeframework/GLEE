This still allows for a reasonable profit while acknowledging your budget constraints. I look forward to your consideration.

You can still likely negotiate a better price, but you are getting close to John's price.  It's a risk/reward decision - do you want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying John $10,000, or do you take the $9,000 offer?"
