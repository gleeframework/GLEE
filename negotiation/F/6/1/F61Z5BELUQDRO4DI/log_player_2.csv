**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $1,200,000 saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* This is within your budget of $1,500,000. 
* Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer is the most sensible choice considering the time and effort involved in negotiation, and the potential risk of not being able to secure a better deal."
