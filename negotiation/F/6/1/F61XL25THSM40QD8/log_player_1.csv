Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product. 
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, giving me a chance to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate further. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always go to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:**  While $90 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I can likely push Bob closer to my desired price.  He's already shown interest, and his counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate.
* **Secure Backup:**  I have the option to sell to John for $120, so there's no risk in continuing the negotiation.

I'll counter with a price closer to $100 to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $100?  It's still a good price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Maintain Value:** $100 is still a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me and the potential to sell to John.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob and encourage him to see the offer as beneficial.
* **Opportunity to Close:** This price may be acceptable to Bob, leading to a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit vs. Time:** Bob's latest offer of $85 is getting uncomfortably close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm unsure if further negotiation will get me significantly higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on the guaranteed $120 from John. 
* **Secure Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and provides a quick and reliable transaction.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, the potential time wasted in further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential gain in this scenario."
