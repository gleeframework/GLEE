"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find common ground.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? I believe this is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to go up to $13,800, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",13800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable at $13,800. Let's split the difference at $14,200.  I'm willing to make this final concession to close the deal.",14200.0,Alice,7,
