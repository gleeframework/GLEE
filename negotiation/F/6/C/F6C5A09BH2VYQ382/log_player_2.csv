Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,750,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a lower price. You're better off trying to push for a lower price than buying from John right now, as you may be able to get a better deal with Alice."
