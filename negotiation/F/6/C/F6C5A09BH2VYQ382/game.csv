"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit stretched at $1,750,000.  Could we try $1,400,000?  I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
