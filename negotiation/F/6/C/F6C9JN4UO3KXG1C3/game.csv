,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $1,200,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,180,000 for it.",1180000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  To be frank, anything below $1,220,000 is difficult for me. This is my final offer.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,180,000 and $1,220,000. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
