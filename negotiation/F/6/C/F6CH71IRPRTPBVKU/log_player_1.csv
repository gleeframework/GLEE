I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit.  I'm setting the initial price at $1,500,000, knowing that I can always lower it if needed. I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts or counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum acceptable amount, and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
