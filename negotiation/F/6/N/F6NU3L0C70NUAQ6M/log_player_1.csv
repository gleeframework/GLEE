Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can finalize this deal.  If not, I'll have to consider my other options.
