"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  He should continue to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can finalize this deal.  If not, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $950,000. I'm still not comfortable going that low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above his maximum budget.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at a price he's comfortable with."
