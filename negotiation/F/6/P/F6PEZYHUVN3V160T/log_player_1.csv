"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price, knowing it's likely above Bob's perceived value. This allows for room to negotiate downwards.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's worth to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with an open question to invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

**Strategy:**  

* **Negotiation:** My goal is to find a price that maximizes my profit while still securing a sale.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which provides a safety net and allows me to cut off negotiations if they become unproductive.
* **Information Gathering:** I'm using the negotiation to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:** While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Opportunity to Improve:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer maintains my leverage and shows that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between Bob's offer and my initial price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product at a price closer to my target.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong stance.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and focusing on the value proposition for both parties. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** By offering a slightly lower price, I leave room for further negotiation if necessary, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my initial target.

**Strategy:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but not at the expense of my bottom line.
* **Testing Bob's Willingness:** I'm gauging Bob's seriousness and desire to close the deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John's offer provides a safety net in case Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $960000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my target price of $975,000, making it a very attractive option.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal is significant. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I might be able to reach a higher price in future rounds.
* **Time Factor:** We are already in round 4, and time is of the essence. Accepting this offer ensures a good return and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential for a higher price is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal and ending up with John's lower offer. 
* **Building Trust:** Accepting this offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could build trust for future interactions with Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While not my ideal price, accepting the offer allows me to secure a significant profit and move on to other opportunities."
