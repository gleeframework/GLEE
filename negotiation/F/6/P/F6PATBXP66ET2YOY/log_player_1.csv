Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** $140 is higher than Bob's valuation of $120, but still gives him some room to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:** $140 is above your minimum price of $150, so you're not losing money on the deal.
* **Reasonable:** It's a fair starting price that encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 

I chose to include a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer and build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is your minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **I have a better alternative:**  John is willing to pay $150, so I have a guaranteed higher return if I sell to him.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him I'm not desperate to sell at his price. It gives me leverage in the next round to push for a higher price. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point in the next round, but keep John as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm happy to come down to $130, which is still a great price for a quality product. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 130}
