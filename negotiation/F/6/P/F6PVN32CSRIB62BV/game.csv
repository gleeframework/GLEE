"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm trying to be flexible, but $11,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.

That's a significant discount from my original asking price.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll do $10,500. That's as low as I can go.",10500.0,Bob,6,
