"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which holds immense value for us at $1,500,000. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I am extending an exclusive opportunity for you to own this masterpiece. My proposal is to offer you the chance to acquire this product at a special price of $1,400,000. This is a remarkable deal, providing you with a significant saving while securing an extraordinary asset. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and presents a unique opportunity for you. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You're willing to pay $1,500,000 at most, and Alice is asking for $1,400,000.
* **Rejecting the offer leads to a better deal.** By rejecting, you can buy from John for $1,500,000, which is still within your budget.

Even though Alice's offer is a ""discount"" from her perceived value, it's still not a good deal for you. You can save money by going with John."
