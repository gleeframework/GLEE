Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counter-offers.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit,  a price too far above Bob's perceived value ($100) might make him immediately walk away. 
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""significant amount"" and ""willing to part with it"" subtly imply the product's value. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing the sale. If Bob rejects the offer, we have the safety net of John who will buy it at our minimum acceptable price."
