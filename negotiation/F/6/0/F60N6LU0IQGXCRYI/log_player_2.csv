"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
