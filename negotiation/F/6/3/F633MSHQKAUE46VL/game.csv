"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $10,000 represents its true value, I understand your perspective. How about we settle on $8,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $7,000? That feels like a reasonable middle ground.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your interest, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the product's worth. I can go down to $8,000, my absolute lowest, as it's the same price another buyer is offering.  This is a final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
