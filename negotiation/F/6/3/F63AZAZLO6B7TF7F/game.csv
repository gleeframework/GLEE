"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $10,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I think we can find a middle ground. How about I offer the product for $9,500? This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,375 for the product? This gives us both a reasonable profit margin while still being a fair price for you.",9375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,375 is still a bit above my target. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $9,125. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise. Considering your latest offer, I propose we set the product price at $9,200. This gives you a good deal while ensuring a satisfactory profit for me. I hope you'll find this proposal acceptable.",9200.0,Alice,7,
