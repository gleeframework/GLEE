{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $100,000 discount from what you'd get from John, and you still make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
