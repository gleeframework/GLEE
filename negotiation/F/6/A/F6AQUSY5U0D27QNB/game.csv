"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $16,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,000, which would be $13,500. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is a fair compromise. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you can accept this offer, I'll take the product. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",14000.0,Bob,6,
