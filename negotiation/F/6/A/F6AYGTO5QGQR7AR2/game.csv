"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't go as low as $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 for this to make sense. Would you be willing to settle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
