Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80. It's better to secure the sale than risk further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a sale to John for $80."
