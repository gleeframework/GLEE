"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,025,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering both our needs.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
