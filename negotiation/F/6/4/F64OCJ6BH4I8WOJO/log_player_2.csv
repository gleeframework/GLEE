"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to the product's value for Alice, but still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $900,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while still keeping the offer within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to her, but it's now within Bob's budget and a good price considering he can buy from John for $1,500,000. It's a good compromise that allows Bob to secure the product without overspending."
