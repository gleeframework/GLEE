Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment.  I'm offering it to you at a premium price of $950,000.  I'm confident it will be highly valuable to your endeavors."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still potentially attractive compared to losing the deal entirely.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and this initial high price gives Alice room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above $1,000,000.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while acknowledging the guaranteed offer from John."
