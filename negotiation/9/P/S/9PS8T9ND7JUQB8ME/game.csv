"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your business. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. How about we try $875,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  However, $875,000 is still a little below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $890,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can make this deal work!",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $890,000, so how about $887,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",887500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this deal work for me. How about we compromise again at $895,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.",895000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go above $887,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on that price. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $887,500.",887500.0,Bob,8,
