Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
