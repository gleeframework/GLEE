"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,800,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
