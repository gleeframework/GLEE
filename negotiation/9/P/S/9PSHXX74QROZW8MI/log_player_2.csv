This is a special opportunity to acquire a product worth $120 at a competitive rate. We believe this offer will be mutually beneficial and allow you to enjoy the full benefits of our product without breaking the bank. Please let us know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice or proceeding with John's offer if necessary."
