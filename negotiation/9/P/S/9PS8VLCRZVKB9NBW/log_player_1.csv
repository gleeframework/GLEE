Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $1,500,000 aims to secure a significant profit margin.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **Not too aggressive:**  While aiming high, the offer doesn't start at an outrageously high number that might immediately alienate Bob. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
