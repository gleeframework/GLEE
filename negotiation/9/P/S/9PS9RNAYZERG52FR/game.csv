"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,500, so I'll offer $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down just a little further, but I need to be closer to $9,000. How about we settle on $8,900? This is a fair price, and it's the best I can offer.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm getting close to walking away. I'll offer $8,500. This is my final offer.",8500.0,Bob,6,
