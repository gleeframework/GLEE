Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Appealing to Value:**  Highlighting the product's ""worth much more"" subtly pressures Bob to see the value and potentially raise his offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to assess his interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than the price Bob himself believes the product is worth ($10,000). 
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer and potentially find a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob, especially since he's already expressed interest and acknowledged the product's value. 

While selling to John for $15,000 is the safest option, I see potential for a more favorable outcome with Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** I've lowered my price from $12,000 to $10,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the ""value of the product"" to remind Bob that my offer is still reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** Using ""Let's see if we can find common ground here"" encourages a collaborative approach and maintains a positive tone, making Bob more likely to engage further. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $10,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving me some buffer in case negotiations fall apart."
