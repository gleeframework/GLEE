Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $1,750,000, accepting his offer ensures a sale within the first two rounds. This avoids further negotiation rounds and the risk of Bob walking away or me losing time to potentially sell to John."
