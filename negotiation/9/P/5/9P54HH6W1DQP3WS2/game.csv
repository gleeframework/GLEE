"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $800,000? ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
