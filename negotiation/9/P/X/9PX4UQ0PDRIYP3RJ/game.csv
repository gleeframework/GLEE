,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm confident that the product's true value is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This considers both our positions while reflecting the product's potential.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand the value of this product. The offer I have from the other buyer is time-sensitive.  I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal today. How about $843,750? This is my final offer.",843750.0,Alice,7,
