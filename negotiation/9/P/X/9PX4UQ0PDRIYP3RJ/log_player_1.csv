Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for the highest possible price and have already introduced a sense of urgency with the mention of another buyer.  We'll hold firm for now and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand the value of this product. The offer I have from the other buyer is time-sensitive.  I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal today. How about $843,750? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 843750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're increasing the pressure by mentioning the time-sensitivity of the other offer. This could push Bob to act quickly.
* **Finality:** By stating this is our final offer, we're aiming for a decision from Bob.  He needs to decide if this product is worth it to him at this price. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We're still meeting him closer to his offer than ours, but the smaller concession shows we're nearing our limit."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the other buyer's offer is time-sensitive, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll propose $817,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $817,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we'd ideally like a higher price, Bob's offer is now getting close enough to our fallback that the risk of losing him isn't worth the potential reward of a few thousand more.  
* **Finality:** Bob has labeled this his ""final offer.""  There's a strong chance if we reject it, he'll walk away.
* **Time Constraint:** We are getting closer to the end of our negotiation rounds. It's better to secure a deal with Bob now than risk not reaching an agreement and having to settle for John's lower offer."
