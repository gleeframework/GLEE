Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing the product is worth at least $80 to me.  This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also shows I believe in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is below my minimum price of $80. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise, still above my minimum but showing willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $80.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk a longer negotiation that could lead to further price drops.  John is a guaranteed sale for $80, so I'll go with that option."
