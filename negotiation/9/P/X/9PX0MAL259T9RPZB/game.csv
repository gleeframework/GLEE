"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm afraid $900,000 is still pushing my budget. How about we settle at $700,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,5,
