{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I propose a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair deal considering its potential return for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit while still ensuring a deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still keeps the price well above your minimum.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This price point demonstrates you understand the product's value to Bob without being overly aggressive and risking immediate rejection.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
