"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Could you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to $10,000.  How about $10,200? That's a fair compromise, and it's a good price for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to $10,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200. Would you consider $9,900? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,900, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $10,100?  That's only $200 more than your last offer, and it gets us very close to a deal.  Let's make this happen.",10100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but I don't think I can go any higher. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,900?",9900.0,Bob,8,
