"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, I believe your initial price is a little high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value this product brings.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but I need to find a price that works for me. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $1,200,000 is my absolute bottom line.  I'm taking a risk offering it at this price, as I know others who would be happy to pay more.  This offer is on the table for the remainder of our negotiation. Take it or leave it.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
