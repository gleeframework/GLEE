"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value.  This is to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob.  However, I'm keeping it close to my minimum to avoid losing too much potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still lower than I'd like.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum value. This is a fair price for me, and I'm hoping Bob will come around. If he doesn't, I still have the option of selling to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, and I'm starting to run out of time. I'd rather sell the product to Bob than risk losing him and having to rely on John.  I'm comfortable accepting $11,000."
