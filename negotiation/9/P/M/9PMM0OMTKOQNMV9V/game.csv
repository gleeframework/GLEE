"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $17,000.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you taking an interest in the product.  While $14,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $15,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $15,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. ",15250.0,Bob,4,
