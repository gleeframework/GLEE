Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting offer that is above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows confidence in the product's value while being open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is closer to your minimum value, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $135?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $125 is a bit lower than what you initially hoped for, it's still above your minimum value and closer to what Bob seems willing to pay.  There's a chance you could get a little more with further negotiation, but the risk of Bob walking away entirely is high. Accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of losing out completely."
