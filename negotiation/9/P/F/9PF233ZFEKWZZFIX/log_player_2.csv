"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for $12,000.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if she's willing to come down in price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite low considering the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $15,000 is better than $18,000, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the product from John for $12,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get her closer to his price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price. Could you do $14,250? This would be a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. He can secure the product from John at the price he's willing to pay, so there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
