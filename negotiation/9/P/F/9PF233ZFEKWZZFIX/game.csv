"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite low considering the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price. Could you do $14,250? This would be a final offer.",14250.0,Alice,5,
