Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from the original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to $700,000 as possible, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession.

Alice has come down to her product's value. It's unlikely she'll go any lower and it's a better deal than John offers.  It's time to accept and secure the savings."
