Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and bring significant value to your organization. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's unique features and the benefits it can bring to your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $800,000 from John.  He'll counteroffer to get a lower price from Alice, but he has the option to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $820000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your organization. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although $820,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John. He'll counteroffer again in hopes of getting a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $760,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product."", ""product_price"": 760000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're close to reaching a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820000 and $760000, which would be $890000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your organization. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $890,000 is still above his budget.  He's already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's clear Alice isn't willing to come down to a price he's comfortable with. Since John is offering the product for his maximum budget, Bob should take the guaranteed deal and avoid further negotiations."
