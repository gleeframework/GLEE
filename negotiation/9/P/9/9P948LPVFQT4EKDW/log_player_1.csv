Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is close to your minimum, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Starting too high might discourage Bob immediately. A price slightly below your guaranteed sale price makes it seem like a good deal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob doesn't know your minimum price or about John's offer. He only knows the product's value to him is $80.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A higher offer has a higher potential profit but also a higher risk of rejection."
