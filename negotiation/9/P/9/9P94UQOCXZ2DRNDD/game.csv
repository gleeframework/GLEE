"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $12,500 to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we settle on $11,000? This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
