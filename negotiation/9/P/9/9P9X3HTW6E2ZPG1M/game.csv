"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than my asking price and allows you a comfortable profit margin. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this work for both of us. This price still allows you to make a profit, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price still allows me to recover a reasonable portion of the product's value and should be within your budget. Let's reach a compromise and finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $925,000? I'm willing to make one more compromise to get this deal done.",925000.0,Bob,6,
