"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business. Let's start our negotiation off strong!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? That feels like a fairer price point.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still offers you a significant value for the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $950,000?  That's a substantial offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still not at a point where I can accept it.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
