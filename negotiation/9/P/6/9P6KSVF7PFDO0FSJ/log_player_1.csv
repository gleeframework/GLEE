Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? That feels like a fairer price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $900,000 is too low. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still offers you a significant value for the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $950,000?  That's a substantial offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still not at a point where I can accept it.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
