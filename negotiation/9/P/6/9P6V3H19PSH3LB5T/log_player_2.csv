Alice is clearly not willing to negotiate down to a price I'm comfortable with.  I've already spent several rounds and there's no guarantee she'll budge further. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's within my budget and I can avoid further negotiation headaches."
