{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about negotiating but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility. This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's offer and is close to my preferred price point. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice. The potential savings from further negotiation are not worth the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer."
