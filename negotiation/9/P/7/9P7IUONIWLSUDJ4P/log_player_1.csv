Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's worth to Bob, you're subtly anchoring the price in his mind.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to rely on him completely. Securing a higher price from Bob is the priority.

This offer aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough to potentially secure a deal with Bob."
