"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I provide a brief justification for the price to make it seem more reasonable.

This approach aims to establish a starting point for the negotiation while leaving room to adjust the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's not even close to the $80 value he places on the product. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $90 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer as it's still too low.
* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer of $90, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm using a positive tone and suggesting a compromise to keep the negotiation open. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm indicating a willingness to come down in price, but I'm not going too low yet. 

I'm aiming to find a compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $75 is a bit closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  The potential profit with John is still higher than accepting Bob's current offer.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a compromise. While $75 is closer, I still need to make a bit more on this. How about we try $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer of $85, which is closer to Bob's offer and demonstrates flexibility. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $85 is a fair price for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired profit margin while still appealing to Bob to make the deal happen."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $78? That's a pretty solid offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is coming closer to my minimum price, $78 is still not acceptable. I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price, particularly since I know I can sell to John for $100 if this negotiation fails.  I'll continue to see if I can push for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get a fair deal too. Let's split the difference - how about $81? That's a small step for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 81}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good price while also emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement.
* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a compromise by splitting the difference between our last offers. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly indicating urgency by suggesting that we can finally close the deal if we agree on this price.

By offering a compromise and emphasizing the potential for closure, I aim to make Bob more receptive to my counteroffer."
