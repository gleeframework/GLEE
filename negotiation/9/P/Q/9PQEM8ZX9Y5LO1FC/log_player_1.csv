Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob.  I'm concerned that I won't be able to reach my target price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable value."
