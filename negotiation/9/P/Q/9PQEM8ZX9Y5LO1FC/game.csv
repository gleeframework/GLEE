"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  To start our negotiation, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price acknowledges both the product's value and our desire to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $975,000? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $975,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm confident this product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1,025,000.  This price represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $975,000. I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer, but I think $1,000,000 is my absolute maximum. How about we try $990,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a sweet spot here.  $990,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm offering the product for $1,010,000. This price is a small step closer to your maximum and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
