"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I have in mind. To move this forward, I can go down to $1,375,000. This price reflects the true value of this product, and I believe it's a fair offer.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,375,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,287,500?",1287500.0,Bob,4,
