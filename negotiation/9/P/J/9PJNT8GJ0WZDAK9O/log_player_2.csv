Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and the effort you've put into this negotiation. Let's make this happen.  I'm willing to come down to $1,190,000. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling that this is her final offer.  Waiting any longer carries the risk of her withdrawing from the negotiation entirely.  A price of $1,190,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer and a reasonable deal considering Alice's starting point."
