"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I propose that we come to an agreement at a price of $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also considering your needs and budget. I look forward to your response and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You're aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your understanding of my budget. While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it while staying within my budget. I'm hopeful we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
