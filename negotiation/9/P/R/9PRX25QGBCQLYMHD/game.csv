"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your understanding of my budget. While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it while staying within my budget. I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
