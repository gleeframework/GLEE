"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,750? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth the investment.",15750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,750 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,250.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a reasonable profit.",15250.0,Bob,4,
