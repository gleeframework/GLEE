Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still within your budget and closer to your desired price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice may reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
