"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
