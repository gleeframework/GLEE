"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice, as her offer is only slightly below my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying the product but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try another counteroffer closer to her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still holding firm on getting a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably and is stating this is her final offer.  While I might be able to haggle a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Accepting $10,200 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000 price."
