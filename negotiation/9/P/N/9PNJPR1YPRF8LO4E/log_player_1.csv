Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product would be useful for me, but  $22,000 is not within my budget.  Would you consider something closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still quite a bit lower than my minimum. I'll try to meet him halfway.
