"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product would be useful for me, but  $22,000 is not within my budget.  Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
