"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away entirely. Also, with 6 rounds left, there's still a good chance I could sell it to another buyer for a higher price."
