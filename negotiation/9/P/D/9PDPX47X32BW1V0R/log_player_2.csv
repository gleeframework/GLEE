"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can likely get a better deal than $140.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's meet in the middle on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price for you, considering your maximum budget is $150 and the product is worth $120 to her.  It's better than buying from John for $150."
