"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique product, but I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $800000 as it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and the premium you're willing to pay for its uniqueness.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value and the unique opportunity to own it.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $950000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. I hope you can understand my position and meet me at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $950000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $925000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $975000. This is as close as I can get to your target price, considering the product's value to me. I hope you can understand my position and meet me at this price.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $925000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm going to make a final offer of $925000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",925000.0,Bob,8,
