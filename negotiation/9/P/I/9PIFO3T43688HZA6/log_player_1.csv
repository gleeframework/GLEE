"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a large profit.  $1,200,000 is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to Bob.  This could encourage him to make a counteroffer instead of rejecting outright. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and can potentially close a deal at a very favorable price. However, I'm prepared to lower my offer if necessary, and always have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my ideal price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:**  I have 10 rounds, so there's room for more back-and-forth. I'm confident I can secure a higher price, especially as Bob has shown interest.
* **John as a safety net:** Even if I can't secure a better deal with Bob, I have John as a fallback option, guaranteeing me at least $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable sale for myself.
* **Message:** I'm remaining positive and highlighting the ""fairness"" of my offer. This can help keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal quickly.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $1,050,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum price, ensuring I make a substantial profit. 
* **Staying in Control:** I'm still holding the upper hand in the negotiation, as I have John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $975,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can secure a higher price, especially as Bob has shown continued interest.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** I still have 6 rounds to go, which gives me ample time to continue negotiating.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $975,000 is a significant profit, but I'm aiming for even better.
* **John as a safety net:** Even if I can't secure a better deal with Bob, I have John as a fallback option, guaranteeing me at least $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. It's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm reducing my price slightly from $1,050,000 to $1,000,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing that my offer is a ""win-win."" This can create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** This counteroffer attempts to bridge the gap between our positions.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $1,000,000 is still a substantial profit for me.
* **Time Pressure:** With only five rounds left, I'm creating a sense of urgency to push Bob towards acceptance.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I always have John as a backup option, providing a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to move on the price.  To be honest, I have another offer I need to consider.  If you're able to come down to $950,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I would prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob has clearly established that this is his final offer, and I risk losing the deal if I reject it.
* **Time Pressure:** With only four rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating and risk a potential stalemate.
* **Profit:** While $950,000 is not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit, and I'm confident that I can use this sale to pursue other opportunities.

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale, minimizes risk, and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
