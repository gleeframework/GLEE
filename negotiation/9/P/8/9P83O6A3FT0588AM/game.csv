"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,175,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,175,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit stretched. I'd be happy to settle at $1,100,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $1,150,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great deal for you, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
