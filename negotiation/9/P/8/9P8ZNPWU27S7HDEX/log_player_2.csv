"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $150 for the product. Alice's offer of $180 is above Bob's limit. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and buy the product from John for $150."
