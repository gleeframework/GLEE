"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its market value.  Consider this my best initial offer. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects a significant discount for you and provides me with a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price.  He can still purchase from John for $800,000 if he can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I value our ongoing negotiation, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to her initial offer. While Bob could potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or offer a higher price in subsequent rounds.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option at this point."
