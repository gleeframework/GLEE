"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I can move it quickly. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the value the product offers and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This offer keeps us both relatively close to our original positions.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Remember, I have another buyer waiting, so let's see if we can reach an agreement quickly.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to move a little higher.  Would you consider $810,000? This is a strong offer, and I need to stay within my budget.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer, $810,000 still falls short of what this product is worth.  To be honest, I'm ready to move on to another buyer who's willing to pay a fairer price.  I'm going to end negotiations for now.  If you reconsider and are willing to come closer to my previous offer, let me know.  Otherwise, I'm going to sell to someone else.",0.0,Alice,7,
