"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're trying to get the product for as low as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice at this point. You can then try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're still trying to get the best deal possible, and $100 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering it to you for $95. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a great price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice is offering $95, which is still higher than your maximum budget of $80. You have the option of continuing to negotiate, but it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice to go lower. It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $80."
