# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it brings, I propose a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is still above his budget, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $750,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your current budget constraints, I'd like to present an alternative. I am willing to consider $825,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it will still allow us to achieve a satisfactory outcome for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $825,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his target of $800,000. He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice or buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
