"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $750,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your current budget constraints, I'd like to present an alternative. I am willing to consider $825,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it will still allow us to achieve a satisfactory outcome for both parties.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
