Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. His response will guide your next move, whether it's negotiating down or sticking closer to your backup offer.
* **Psychological impact:**  A higher initial offer can sometimes make the final price seem more reasonable, even after negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You can always adjust your price closer to $800,000 if needed, ensuring you still make a profit."
