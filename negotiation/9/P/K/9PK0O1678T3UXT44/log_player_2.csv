Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're committed to your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see some movement from your side. I'll offer $1,050,000. This is my final compromise.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now within striking distance of my target price.
* While $1,050,000 is still above my desired price, it's a good deal considering we only have 3 rounds left.
*  If I reject this offer, it's likely Alice will stick to her price, and I might be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
*  It's a good compromise to accept this offer and avoid the risk of a higher price."
