"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still within my range. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's work towards a solution.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're committed to your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see some movement from your side. I'll offer $1,050,000. This is my final compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
