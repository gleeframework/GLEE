"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,100,000. This is a serious offer reflecting the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm still very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. Could we settle on $750,000?  I think this represents a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's true worth.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still beyond what I'm able to spend. To be honest, I have another offer for $800,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm ready to move forward with the other offer if we can't reach an agreement. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
