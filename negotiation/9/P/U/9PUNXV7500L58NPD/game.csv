"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $200 might have been a bit high, I can't go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is closer to where I'm comfortable.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, I can't drop the price to $120. My final offer is $140. This is a great price for this product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",140.0,Alice,5,
