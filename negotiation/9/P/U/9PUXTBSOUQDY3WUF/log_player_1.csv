"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial High Offer:**  I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to establish a higher starting point for negotiations.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and uniqueness to justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While I'm starting high, I'm leaving room for negotiation by inviting Bob to share his thoughts.

This strategy sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, aiming to maximize my profits while remaining open to a possible deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While I'm not satisfied with Bob's initial counteroffer, I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain leverage and force him to come up with a more attractive counteroffer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can control the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference – I'll accept $1,700,000. This reflects the product's true value and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise – the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Fairness and Value:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the product's true value.
* **Open to a Deal:** My message aims to convince Bob that this is a good opportunity to close the deal.

By offering a compromise, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you're placing on it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is a Factor:** We are already in Round 4, and with each round, the possibility of a deal with John increases, and John is willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While I would prefer to get a higher price, securing a deal with Bob now opens the possibility of future collaborations and potentially better deals in the future. 

Considering the proximity to my minimum price, the potential for future deals, and the time constraint, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best strategic decision."
