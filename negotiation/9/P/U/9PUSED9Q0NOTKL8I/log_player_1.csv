Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's worth the price for the value it provides.  I'm asking for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($150) sets an anchor in Bob's mind. Even though it's more than his perceived value, it makes a lower counter-offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Creating Perceived Value:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, encouraging Bob to consider what it might be worth to him.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  By mentioning offering the product to Bob before listing it publicly, I create a sense of urgency and exclusivity.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can always lower the price or accept John's offer as a fallback."
