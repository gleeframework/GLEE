"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1600000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not convinced that $1650000 is sufficient for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1680000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,
