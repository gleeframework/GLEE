"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
