Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000, which is the price I would get from John. This gives Bob the opportunity to get the product for the same price as John, but it also allows me to maximize my profit. Since Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, there's a chance he might accept the offer, even if it's a bit higher than his initial valuation."
