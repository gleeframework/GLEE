"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
