"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  
* **I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate.** There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'd prefer to maximize my profits.**  

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.** This is the best I can do without risking losing the deal. 
* **I've already rejected Bob's previous offers and have only 6 rounds left.** It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more concessions and a lower final price.
* **Selling to John would guarantee $12,000, but I'd rather secure the sale now.** 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice to maximize my earnings in this scenario."
