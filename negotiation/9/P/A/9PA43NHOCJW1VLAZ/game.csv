"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
