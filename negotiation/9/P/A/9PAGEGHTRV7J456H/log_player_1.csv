Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, I'll consider it carefully. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $820,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll aim to get closer to my initial offer of $850,000. Here's my counteroffer:

I've already rejected his offer once, and I'm not sure if I want to go back to him again. Considering the option of selling to John for $800,000, which is a decent price, I think I'll take the safe bet and sell the product to John.
