"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product for a competitive price. I believe our product will be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still allows you to save some money, while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but the price is still a little high for me. How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
