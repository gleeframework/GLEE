,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our initial offers and still allows you to acquire a unique opportunity.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for the product. I think this price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering the product to you for $1800000. This price is closer to my initial offer, but still a significant reduction from the original price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
