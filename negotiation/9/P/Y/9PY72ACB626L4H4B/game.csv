"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you proposed is quite a bit lower than what I can agree to.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the product's worth, $1,300,000 is still above my limit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This price is closer to my budget, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in reaching a deal.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to accept $1,225,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to conclude this negotiation.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,175,000.  This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
