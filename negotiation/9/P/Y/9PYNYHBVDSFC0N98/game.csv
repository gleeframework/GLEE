"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but  $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $800,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and compromised at $800000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $775000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $750,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $750000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $825000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm disappointed you couldn't meet me closer to my price point. I'm starting to think this deal won't work out. Unless you're willing to reconsider a price closer to $750,000, I'm prepared to walk away and pursue other options.",750000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a decision, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge on the price at this point. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $825000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to someone else.",825000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $760,000.  If you can't accept that, I'm walking away and going with John.",760000.0,Bob,10,
