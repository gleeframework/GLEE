"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
