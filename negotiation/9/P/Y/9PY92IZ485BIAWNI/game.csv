,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think the product is worth more than that. How about we meet at $117? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",117.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $117 is still a little too high for me. Let's try $112.  I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $112, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin too much. How about we meet at $119? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",119.0,Alice,7,
