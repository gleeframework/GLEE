"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $8,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your position, I need to maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  This would allow both of us to get a fair deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,200 for the product?",9200.0,Alice,5,
