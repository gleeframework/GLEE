Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise and to test the waters. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that I'm serious about selling and that he should accept this offer."
