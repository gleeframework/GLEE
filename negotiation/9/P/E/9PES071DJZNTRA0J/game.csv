"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,850,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other options.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
