Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value of this product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,850,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his ""final offer"" is still significantly below what John is offering. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge that gap, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
