"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,000, which is the lowest I can go.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and your profit margin. Let's try to close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,500, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $9,200, which is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,5,
