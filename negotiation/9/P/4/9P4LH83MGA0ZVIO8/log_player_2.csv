"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. This means you save $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though Alice values the product at $80, it's not relevant to your decision.** You are focused on your own value and the best price you can get."
