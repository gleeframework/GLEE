Alice's offer:

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we're still not at a point where it's a clear win for us. We'll continue negotiating."

Given your initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $11,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While we could likely push for a slightly lower price, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting the $11,000 offer ensures we get the product at a significant discount compared to John's price."
