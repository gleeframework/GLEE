"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $2000000. I believe its value to you will far exceed this price, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This reflects the value I know this product holds. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a lower offer. How about $1200000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to accept $1350000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my confidence in the product's value to you. Let's finalize this and make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1350000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I'd like to propose $1200000 as the final price. If we can meet at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
