"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $140. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $140 is less than $150.
* **It's still within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $150, so $140 is a good deal."
