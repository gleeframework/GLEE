This offer aims to get a good price, but leaves room for negotiation. It's  above the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000), but still within a range where Bob might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer with a price that's closer to my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm willing to offer $1500000, which is the maximum I can spend. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the current market conditions.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's final offer matches my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  It's not ideal, but it's the best deal I can get right now, so I'll take it."
