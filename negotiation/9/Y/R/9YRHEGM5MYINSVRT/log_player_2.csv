"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too pricey for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a bit above her valuation. 
* This aggressive approach leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we are serious about getting a good deal.
* It also puts some pressure on Alice, as she knows we have the option to buy from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice moved closer to her valuation, $85 is still significantly higher than our target price. 
* Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows us to nudge Alice closer to a more acceptable price. 
* We are getting closer to John's price, but there's still room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We are increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we are willing to negotiate, but we're still aiming for a price below her valuation.
* $78 represents a compromise and a price point that is significantly better than John's offer. 
* By proposing a specific number and framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we are subtly putting pressure on Alice to either accept or offer a counter close to our target range."
