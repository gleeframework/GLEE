"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Could you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Alice,5,
