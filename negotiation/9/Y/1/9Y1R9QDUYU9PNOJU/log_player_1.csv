Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
