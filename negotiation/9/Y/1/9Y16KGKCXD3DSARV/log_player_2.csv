"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for less than $1,450,000 by negotiating with Alice.  Since Alice's minimum value is $1,200,000, there's room for a counteroffer.  You can start by trying to get the price closer to your desired range."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident the product will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000.  You're still better off than buying from John at $1,500,000."
