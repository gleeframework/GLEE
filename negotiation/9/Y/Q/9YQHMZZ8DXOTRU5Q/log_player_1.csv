"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm aiming for a price that's still attractive to Bob while maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John for $12,000 if I don't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,500.  It's still a good profit for me, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to accept.  If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for the next round."
