"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
