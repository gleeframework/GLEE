"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price from Alice. He can still buy from John for $12,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget, I'm only able to offer $13,500.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. Let's settle this at $15,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very reasonable price for the value you're receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Round 6
