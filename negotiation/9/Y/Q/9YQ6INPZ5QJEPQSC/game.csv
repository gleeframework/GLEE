"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget, I'm only able to offer $13,500.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. Let's settle this at $15,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very reasonable price for the value you're receiving.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $15,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. If we can reach an agreement, I'm ready to close the deal today.",14000.0,Bob,6,
