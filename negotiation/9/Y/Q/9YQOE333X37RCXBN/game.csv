"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking to sell it to you for $15000. I believe it's a fair price considering its quality and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is my minimum price. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. However, I want to make it clear that I'm only willing to go this low because I'm open to other potential buyers. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at $10000.
