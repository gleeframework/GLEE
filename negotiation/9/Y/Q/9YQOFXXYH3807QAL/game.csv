"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is a significant investment for me.  I believe it's a fair price, considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly less than its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $800,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I value your interest, I need to be fair to myself. Let's make this work: $1,100,000 and we have a deal.  This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my desire to close this deal with you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still pushing my budget. My final offer is $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my absolute final offer. It's a significant discount and a fair deal considering the value this product brings.  Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
