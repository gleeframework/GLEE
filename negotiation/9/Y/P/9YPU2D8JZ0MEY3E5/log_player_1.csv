"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it at $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is worth less than $80 to me. Can we negotiate a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I believe the product is worth more than $75 to me and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $80 for the product, which is my maximum budget. I hope this aligns with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's time to accept his offer and close the deal."
