Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves me with a profit. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, as it's still below his perceived value of $8,000. 

If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.  

However, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,500. This is a slight increase from his offer, but it's still a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit."
