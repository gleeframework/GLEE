"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider it?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob! I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to some negotiation. How about we meet at $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. How about we meet at $1050000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can go as low as $1050000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1080000?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we meet at $1010000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1010000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the value of the product. How about we meet at $1050000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we meet at $1025000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
