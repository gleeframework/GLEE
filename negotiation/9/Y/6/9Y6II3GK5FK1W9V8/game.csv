"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 isn't quite meeting my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great price for the value you'll receive. Let's finalize this deal!",1087500.0,Alice,5,
