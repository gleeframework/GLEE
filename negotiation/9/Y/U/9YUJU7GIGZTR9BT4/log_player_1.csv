Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get from the product. This encourages him to consider accepting.

**Strategy:**

This is a starting point to initiate negotiations. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'll always have the option of selling to John if the negotiations don't work out in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident I can do better with a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round to try and get a higher price. I'll use this opportunity to gauge his willingness to pay and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. Let's split the difference and meet at $975,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a high-value product for a very competitive price. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price of $975,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value Bob will receive for the price, reinforcing the ""good deal"" aspect. I'm also expressing confidence in finding a mutually beneficial solution, which helps keep the negotiation positive and constructive. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise and highlighting the value proposition, I'm hoping to convince Bob to accept the counteroffer. If he rejects again, I'll reassess my position and consider either making a final counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider a price of $960,000 for your product. This is a fair compromise, given the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $950,000. It's more profitable to sell to Bob at this price rather than selling to John for $1,200,000, considering the potential for further negotiations with Bob could lead to a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profitable sale without risking further negotiation rounds that could potentially lead to a lower price. The $960,000 price point is a good compromise that allows me to get a significant portion of my desired value."
