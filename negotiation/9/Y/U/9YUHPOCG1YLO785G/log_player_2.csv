{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John as a backup if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $1,000,000, it's logical to start with my highest possible offer.  This demonstrates my seriousness about buying the product while also establishing a clear lower limit for negotiations."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Alice has shown some willingness to come down in price. I'm offering a price that's halfway between her last offer and my maximum budget, hoping to find a middle ground. This also shows that I'm willing to compromise but still expect a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's still a bit too high. I want to see if I can get her to come down further. It's also important to remember that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not in a rush to accept just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly, demonstrating that I'm serious about buying the product, but staying below my maximum budget.  This small increase in price might incentivize Alice to accept, as we are getting closer to a potential agreement."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my desired price point. I'm still within my budget, but I want to see if I can push for a lower price. It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if we can meet in the middle. I'm also not in a rush, as I have the option of buying from John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but just slightly. I'm trying to meet Alice halfway by offering a price that's closer to her last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to save as much money as possible. I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted, as it's only slightly above my previous offer and still under my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still above my comfort zone.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems she's not willing to go any lower.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed alternative with John. 

Considering the time and effort invested so far, and the fact that John's offer is within my budget, it's more efficient to accept John's offer and secure the product without further delays."
