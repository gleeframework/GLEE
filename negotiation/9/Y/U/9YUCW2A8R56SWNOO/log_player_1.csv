Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the price."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  I'm not just throwing out a number, I'm hinting at value beyond Bob's initial assessment to pique his interest. 
* **Alternative:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, which gives me leverage. I won't hesitate to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it's not heading in a favorable direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is expected. I'm not willing to settle for a price that low. I know I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so I'll counter-offer and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above my minimum. 
* **Firmness:** I'm not budging much from my previous offer. This signals that I'm serious about the value and not desperate to sell at any price.
* **John in the Background:**  Having John as a backup buyer allows me to confidently negotiate for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would you consider $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is now above my absolute minimum and closer to my initial asking price. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation where Bob might lowball again, potentially leading to a stalemate. It's a reasonable compromise to secure a sale."
