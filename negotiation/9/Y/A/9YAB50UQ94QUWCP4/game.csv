"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000 to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm ready to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to me and the profit you can still earn. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $850,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while taking into account your valuation of the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
