"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's important to start negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000 to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit too high. Bob is still better off continuing to negotiate with Alice and see if she'll go lower.  It's worth noting that John's offer of $800,000 is always available as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm ready to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to me and the profit you can still earn. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $850,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while taking into account your valuation of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is now very close to Bob's ideal price of $800,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a reasonable price, especially considering the time and effort spent negotiating. While John offers a lower price, it's worth considering the potential benefits of working with Alice, such as a potential long-term business relationship.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, as Alice may not budge further, or the deal could fall apart due to time constraints."
