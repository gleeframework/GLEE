"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be perfect for you. My asking price is $9,500, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping for. I have 8 rounds left and John is willing to pay a price that's closer to my desired value.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get closer to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget in mind. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, which would be $7,000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take $7,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum goal of $10,000. I have 6 rounds left, and John is still a viable option if I can't reach an agreement with Bob.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $8,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
