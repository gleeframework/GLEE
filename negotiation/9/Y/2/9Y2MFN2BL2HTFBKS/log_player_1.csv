"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down and still potentially get a good deal. 
* **Being Friendly:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is $6,000 above Bob's valuation, leaving significant room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible. I'll likely need to lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my initial asking price. If he doesn't come close, I can always move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean losing money.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can likely negotiate a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range. I'll aim for a price that's still attractive to Bob but also profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While I value your business, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this work.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $16,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to make a profit.
* **Encouraging negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, hoping Bob will come up a bit.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price that's acceptable to Bob while still being profitable for me. If he rejects this offer, I can assess whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet your price of $16,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing out:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might not counteroffer again, and I might end up selling to John for $15,000.
* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 4, and I only have 10 rounds total. It's getting closer to the time when I need to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum price, accepting this offer allows me to make a decent profit and secure the deal. It's a calculated risk, but with limited time remaining, it's the most sensible choice."
