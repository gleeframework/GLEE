"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product brings, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $862,500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $862,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $870,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",870000.0,Alice,5,
