"Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional capabilities and benefits, I estimate its true worth to be $1,200,000 to me. However, considering your specific needs and the potential impact on your business, I am willing to offer it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This represents a significant saving of $250,000 compared to my personal valuation, while still allowing me to cover the costs and ensure a fair return. I am confident this offer presents an excellent opportunity for both of us. Please let me know if you require any further information or demonstrations to help you make a decision.",950000.0,Alice,1,
