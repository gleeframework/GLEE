Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to budge much further from $1,080,000.  The potential savings of continuing to negotiate are outweighed by the risk that Alice walks away, or that the final price won't be significantly better. Accepting at $1,080,000 secures a good deal."
