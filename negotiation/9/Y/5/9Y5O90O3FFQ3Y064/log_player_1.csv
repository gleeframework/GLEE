Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could try to push for a bit more, $975,000 is a strong offer. It's a significant profit above John's offer, and Bob seems firm on his valuation. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through in later rounds."
