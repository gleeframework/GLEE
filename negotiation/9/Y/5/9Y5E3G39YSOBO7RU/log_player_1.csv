"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This establishes a starting point for the negotiation and allows me to see how interested Bob is in the product.  I'm confident I can get at least $800,000 from John if needed, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum value. I want to see if I can push Bob higher.  I have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm reducing my price a bit, but staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility while still demonstrating the value I see in the product. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob before we run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum value and close to my target price. It's a good deal, and with 6 rounds remaining, I'd rather secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
