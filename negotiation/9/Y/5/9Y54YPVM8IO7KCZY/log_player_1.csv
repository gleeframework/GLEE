Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.  

If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer or accept his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum value of $12,000 and the potential to sell to John for that price if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd prefer to get.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,750. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above his perceived value. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement without having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's counteroffer is getting close to my minimum, but I'm not comfortable going lower. John is offering me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk getting even less from Bob."
