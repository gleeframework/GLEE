"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer but $80 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and I come down to $125?  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $125 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $95 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's a significant drop from my last offer, and I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is getting closer. How about we settle at $100? That's my final offer. ",100.0,Bob,6,
