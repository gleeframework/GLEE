"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit higher than your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value the product brings to you and the market price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value and the market price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
