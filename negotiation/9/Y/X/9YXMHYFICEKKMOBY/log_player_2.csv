"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but unfortunately, $1,800,000 is outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, given its unique qualities and my strong interest. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's price, is a common tactic to establish a lower negotiation range. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's unique qualities and your genuine interest helps soften the blow of the low offer and show Alice that you're serious about the deal.
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  $1,300,000 gives you a lot of room to negotiate upwards if necessary, while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go to $1,450,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  I truly believe this product is worth it, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  The counteroffer is only $150,000 higher than your previous offer, showing Alice that you are serious about negotiating but won't overpay.
* **Emphasize Interest:** Reiterate your genuine interest in the product to make it clear that you are not simply playing games.
* **Reiterate Compromise:**  Emphasize the fact that this is a ""significant move"" from your previous offer to highlight that you are making concessions. 

This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency and show Alice that you are willing to pay a fair price but also have your limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $1,550,000 is very close, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm ready to close the deal at $1,500,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that I'll be a happy owner of this unique product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer directly targets your budget limit, signaling that you are truly at your limit and willing to walk away if this offer isn't accepted.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Highlight the ""fair price"" aspect for both parties to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Confidence and Enthusiasm:**  Expressing confidence and enthusiasm about owning the product can help Alice feel good about closing the deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1525000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,525,000 is very close to your limit. However, you have already made your final offer and it was rejected. It's unlikely that Alice will go lower. You've already reached a point where you're taking a risk.  It's now in your best interest to go with the guaranteed option: buy from John for $1,500,000.  This ensures you get the product within your budget, and avoids further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
