"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but unfortunately, $1800000 is outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1300000 for it, given its unique qualities and my strong interest. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1600000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go to $1450000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  I truly believe this product is worth it, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1450000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1550000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $1550000 is very close, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm ready to close the deal at $1500000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that I'll be a happy owner of this unique product.",1500000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1525000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
