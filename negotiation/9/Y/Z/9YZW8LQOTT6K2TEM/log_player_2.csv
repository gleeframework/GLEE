"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds significant value. While I can't disclose the exact nature of it, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000. This is a chance to secure something truly exceptional.  Consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to sell for $1,500,000, which is the same price you can get from John.  There is no benefit to buying from Alice. You have no information to suggest Alice's product is better than John's, and her statement about a waiting buyer is likely a negotiation tactic."
