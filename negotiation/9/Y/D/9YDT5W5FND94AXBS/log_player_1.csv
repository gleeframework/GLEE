"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so this leaves room for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to  $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum and shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come up to a price that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  It's risky, but I think I can get a higher price if I keep negotiating.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to make one last counteroffer at my minimum price of $1,500,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's a fair price for both of us.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing any more time.  Selling to John will guarantee me my minimum price and allow me to move on to other opportunities."
