Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which still allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm confident it can significantly impact your business positively. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant offer considering my initial budget. This represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. There's no guarantee of getting a better offer from Bob in subsequent rounds, and potentially risking a lower final price. Accepting the $1,200,000 ensures a good deal and avoids leaving money on the table."
