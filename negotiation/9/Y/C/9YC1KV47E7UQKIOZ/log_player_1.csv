{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to maximize her profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Sale:**  While Alice has a backup buyer, it's better to secure a sale with Bob at a higher price than to rely on John's lower offer. 

By starting at $11,500, Alice increases her chances of getting a price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay while still ensuring a profit above her minimum."
