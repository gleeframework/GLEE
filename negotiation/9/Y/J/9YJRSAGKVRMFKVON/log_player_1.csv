"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $70 is way too low. It's below my minimum price of $100, and it's not even close to the value I initially proposed. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counter-offering at $120. This is a compromise from my initial price of $150, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. I hope this will be enticing enough for Bob to consider, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal.  There are still rounds left, and I can always sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer slightly to $110. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, but I still want to maximize my profit. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me and Bob's unwillingness to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to negotiate a little higher. We still have several rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer but still allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price. We're nearing the halfway point in our negotiations, and I want to see if Bob is willing to close the deal. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm running out of time, and it's likely that Bob won't budge much further.  It's better to accept his offer now and get $95, rather than risk getting nothing at all if I keep negotiating and end up selling to John for $100."
