"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me.  I'm willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $1,750,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $700,000?  That's a significant amount and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, but it's also a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. I can do $800,000. That's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair offer considering John is offering the same product at that price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
