{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable price higher than my minimum. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and gauge his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further. I believe Bob may be willing to pay more, and I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? That's a fair middle ground, right?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to $90, Bob's offer of $85 is very close. It's above my minimum and a fair compromise. I'm going to accept his offer."
