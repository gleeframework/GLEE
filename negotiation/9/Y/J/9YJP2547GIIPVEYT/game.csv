"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's true value while still being a good deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which is a fair price given the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
