"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's true value while still being a good deal for you.
