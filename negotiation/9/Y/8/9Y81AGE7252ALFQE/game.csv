"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this point.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $13,500 represents a fair price, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This feels like a good compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $11,500.  I think this price fairly reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away happy.",11500.0,Bob,4,
