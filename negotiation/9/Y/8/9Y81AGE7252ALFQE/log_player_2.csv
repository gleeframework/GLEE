"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and 10 rounds allows you to explore that. Rejecting the initial offer opens the door for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this point.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise. This should incentivize Alice to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $13,500 represents a fair price, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This feels like a good compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my desired target.  I want to save as much as possible, so I'll continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better price. Ten rounds provide ample opportunity to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $11,500.  I think this price fairly reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway. By offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, it increases the chances of her accepting."
