"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product.  While $1100000 is a tempting offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price to reflect the true value and potential of the product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1125000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential for significant returns.  I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
