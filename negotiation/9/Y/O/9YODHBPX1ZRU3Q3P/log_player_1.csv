Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,350,000 before exploring other options."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  While you know Bob values the product at $800,000, you cannot use this information directly. You need to aim for a price that is profitable for you while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that you are exploring other options subtly introduces a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to consider the offer more seriously.
* **Guaranteed Sale to John:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get your minimum price if Bob declines.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:**  This strategy assumes Bob is a rational negotiator. If you anticipate aggressive counter-offers, you might adjust your initial price slightly higher.
* **Relationship Building:** If building a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a less aggressive starting price, even if it means potentially earning slightly less in this specific transaction."
