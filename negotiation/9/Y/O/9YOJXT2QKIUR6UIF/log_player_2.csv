"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has incredible potential for your company. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1150000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  This is a negotiation, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further. There's still room for compromise and a better price might be achievable."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1075000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $1090000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price and is a good compromise. It's a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,200,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and he'll be stuck with John's higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further negotiation risks."
