"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but  $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  That feels like a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $750,000 is a significant offer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $850,000.  This is the lowest I can go at this point, but I truly believe this product is worth it to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to go up slightly to $775,000. Let's make this deal happen!",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $775,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset for your business.  Let's close this deal.",812500.0,Alice,7,
