Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but  $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  That feels like a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  $750,000 is a significant offer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $850,000.  This is the lowest I can go at this point, but I truly believe this product is worth it to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $775,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset for your business.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500

Alice is very slowly coming down, and it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000 in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
