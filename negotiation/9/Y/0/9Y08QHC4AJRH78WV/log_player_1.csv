Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to be negotiated.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have a backup offer, but Bob doesn't know this. This gives you some leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without alienating Bob. A price too close to $1,500,000 might make him walk away, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value to Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** $1,400,000 gives you a strong starting position, aiming for $200,000 above your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, making him feel more involved in the process.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to go back and forth a couple of times.
* **Stay Confident:**  You have a strong alternative with John, which gives you confidence in your pricing.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making it likely that Bob will accept the offer."
