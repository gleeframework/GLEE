"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This item is not just an object; it's a testament to craftsmanship and innovation. I believe its true worth surpasses $1000000, but I am willing to consider your offer. To make this proposition attractive, I propose a starting price of $950000. Please let me know if this aligns with your interests and budget. I look forward to discussing the details further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $50,000 less than John's price.  Even though Alice's message suggests the product is worth more than $1,000,000, there's no guarantee. It's better to save the $50,000 and accept Alice's offer."
