"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to save $100,000 compared to buying from John, there's potential to get a better deal by continuing negotiations. Bob has 10 rounds and Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for further price reductions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more aggressive approach by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening counteroffer, demonstrating Bob's intent to get a good deal and potentially pushing Alice to reconsider. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to save $50,000 compared to buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Bob has 7 more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice has already lowered her price by $50,000, it shows she is willing to negotiate, and Bob can continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a moderate counteroffer, increasing his previous offer by $25,000. This shows he is willing to compromise but still pushing for a lower price.  Since Alice has demonstrated willingness to negotiate,  this counteroffer is likely to be considered by Alice. This approach aims to find a middle ground and potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He can buy the product for $1,025,000, saving $25,000 compared to buying from John. This is a good deal considering that Alice has already lowered her price twice.  It's a significant improvement from the initial offer and gets Bob closer to his goal of saving as much money as possible. While there's potential to negotiate further,  it's risky to continue, as Alice might become less willing to compromise in the remaining rounds.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
