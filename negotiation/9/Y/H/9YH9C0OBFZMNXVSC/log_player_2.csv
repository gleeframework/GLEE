"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her perceived value of $1,000,000. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to my budget, without losing too much on her end.
* **Strategic Move:** By offering a lower price, I am putting pressure on Alice to accept or counter with a more favorable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's offer is lower than her first, it's still above my budget and I'm not willing to pay that much.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can continue to counteroffer with a price closer to my budget and see if Alice is willing to compromise further.
* **Jhon as a Backup:** I'm keeping Jhon as a backup option in case negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer is a significant jump from my previous one, showing I'm serious about buying and willing to meet Alice halfway. It's still lower than her current offer but closer to my budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** This move is a good test to see if Alice is willing to compromise further. If she rejects, I can consider buying from John.
* **Balancing Risk:** While I want to save money, I don't want to risk losing the deal by offering a price Alice finds unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Budget:** Alice's offer is only $150,000 over my maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  
* **Potential for Success:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and this offer might be her final one. Accepting gives me the product for a price that's reasonable and within my range."
