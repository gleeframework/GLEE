Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to maximize my potential profit. Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" hints at the product's worth without revealing my bottom line. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  By asking for Bob's thoughts, I invite him to counter-offer and engage in a discussion that could lead to a mutually beneficial price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a deal."
