You can do better than $120. Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm offering $105, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if Alice is willing to budge a bit."

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still not willing to pay $125. Let's see if we can get closer to my initial offer with another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful Alice will finally agree to it."

Alice is not budging. At this point, it's better to just buy from John. Even though it's more expensive, it's more important to get the product and move on rather than waste more time with Alice."
