"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000) but still within my budget.  However, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible.  I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price to see if we can come to a better agreement."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made some concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $945,000. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $960,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the end of the negotiation, and while Alice has come down significantly, her final offer of $960,000 is still higher than my target.  We've reached a point where further negotiation may not be fruitful, and it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers. 

I'm not willing to go any higher than my target, so it's time to move on to John and his offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's within my budget and ensures I get the product without risking further negotiation."
