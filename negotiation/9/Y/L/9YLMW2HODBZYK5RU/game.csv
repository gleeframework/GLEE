"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1000000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This reflects a fair value considering the potential benefits you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price.  However, $1150000 is still below the value I'm looking for. Let's compromise. I'm willing to offer the product for $1250000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll receive.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
