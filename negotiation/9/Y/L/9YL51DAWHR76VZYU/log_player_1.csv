Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a slightly lower price, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $145? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $150.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly better price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
