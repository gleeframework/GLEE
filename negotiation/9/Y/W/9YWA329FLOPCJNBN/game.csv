"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product seems valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents my initial assessment of the product's worth, I understand your perspective.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,750,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,750,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? I feel this is a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
