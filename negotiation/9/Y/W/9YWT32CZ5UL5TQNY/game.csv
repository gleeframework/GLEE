"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this deal. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $1,500,000. This price reflects the product's true value and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,500,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
