Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this deal. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
