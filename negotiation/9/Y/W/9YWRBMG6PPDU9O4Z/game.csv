"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $14000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at $11500, considering we've already discussed prices below $15000. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $13250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to pay $13250. I'm willing to pay $11750, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to come to an agreement, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $13250. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession. I'll meet you at $13000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession to $13000, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $12500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
