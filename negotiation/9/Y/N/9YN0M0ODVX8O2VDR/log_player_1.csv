Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
