"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to consider the deal while ensuring I don't sell it to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, but I'm also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$11,000 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm increasing the price again, but this time only by a smaller amount. This shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but also that I'm determined to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations with Bob are getting increasingly difficult.  We're getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not close enough to what I want.  With only four rounds left, I'm worried I won't be able to reach a better price.  Therefore, it's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
