"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my usual asking price and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,
