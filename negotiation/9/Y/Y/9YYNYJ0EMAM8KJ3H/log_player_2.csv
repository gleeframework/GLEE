"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, so negotiating with Alice is the best course of action for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still aiming for a price closer to his target of $8,000.  Since he can get the product from John for that price, he shouldn't settle for anything higher right now. There's still time to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is still a good price for the product, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should **reject Alice's offer**. While the price has come down, it's still above his desired target of $8,000.  Since he can buy from John for that price, there's no reason to accept anything higher at this point.  There are still rounds left to negotiate with Alice, and he should continue to aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's try $8,750.  This would be a fair price that's closer to my target.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $8,750, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose **""BuyFromJhon""**.  Alice is unwilling to budge below $9,100, and Bob has only a few rounds left.  Since he can get the product from John for $8,000, it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and go with the guaranteed lower price."
