"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but it's still possible to get a better deal. There's no information about Alice's bottom line, so there's potential to negotiate further.  It's worth exploring the negotiation process before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 5% discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal but leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  The goal is to see if Alice is willing to budge closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $880,000, which is only $30,000 more than my initial counteroffer. This is a good price considering I have limited rounds and can potentially save $120,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise that balances saving money and the risk of losing the deal."
