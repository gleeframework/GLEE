Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make this a smooth transaction.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a price closer to his valuation ($925,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer. 
* **Securing a significant gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at anything above $800,000 is a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Confident but not greedy:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value while expressing a willingness to make a deal. It avoids appearing overly aggressive, which could scare Bob away."
