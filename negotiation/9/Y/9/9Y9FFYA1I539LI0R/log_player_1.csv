Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't accept less than $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000 with John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might scare him off.  Offering a price too low means you leave money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's positive, highlights the product's value, and frames the price as an opportunity.
* **The Price:**  $1,150,000 gives Bob a significant saving ($50,000) compared to his perceived value. It also gives you a substantial profit margin above your minimum and backup offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a more moderate starting price might be preferable.

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in mind!"
