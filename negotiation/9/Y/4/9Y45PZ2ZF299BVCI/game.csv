"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  It's something that's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, as it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
