"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any flexibility on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I can meet you in the middle at $11000. This is my final counteroffer, so let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget at $11000. I'd be willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any chance you could meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I can meet you at $10500, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9750? I'm willing to pay that price, but I don't think I can go any higher.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still a bit above your last offer. I can meet you at $10250, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal!",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9750, which is the same price I offered earlier. Can we make a deal at that price?",9750.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll meet you at $10000. This is my last offer, so please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Alice,9,

,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I've made a series of concessions to try to reach a deal with you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,11,
