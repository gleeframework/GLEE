"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this product.  $8,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference and go with $9,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8,000. How about we meet at $8,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's aim for a final agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to make a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I need to be honest with you, I'm really struggling to go above that price. Can we meet there?",8750.0,Bob,8,
