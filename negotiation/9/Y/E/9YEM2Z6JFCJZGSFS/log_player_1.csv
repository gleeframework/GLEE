"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message highlights the value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open-ended question:**  This invites Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 
* **Option to go to John:**  I have the backup option of selling to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below what I offered him in the first round. 
* **Negotiation space:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Value to John:**  While $12,000 is a great price, it's crucial to explore all negotiation avenues before resorting to selling to John. There's a chance I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-argument:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraint but reiterate that $7,500 is unreasonable. 
* **Middle ground:**  I propose $9,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Value proposition:**  I emphasize that $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the product's worth.
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a friendly and conversational tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, $8,500 is still below my desired $12,000.
* **More negotiation space:**  There's still potential to get a higher price. I can counteroffer and potentially reach an agreement closer to my target. 
* **Time constraints:**  While I can sell to John for $12,000, it's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob. I have 6 rounds left to reach a more favorable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this product.  $8,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference and go with $9,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraint but still push for a higher price.  Offering to split the difference shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I emphasize ""fair price"" and ""good deal"" for both sides, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Time Remaining:**  I still have 5 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a low price.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's value while offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8,000. How about we meet at $8,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** We're in the middle of the negotiation, and I have 4 rounds left. I can still try to push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** While $12,000 is tempting, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  There's a chance I can get a better deal.
* **Potential for Compromise:** I can counteroffer with a price slightly above Bob's offer, potentially reaching a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's aim for a final agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to make a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Compromise:**  I use phrases like ""final agreement"" and ""mutually beneficial"" to signal a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've moved slightly closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to see the worth of the price.
* **Time Consideration:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, but I still have some room to maneuver.
* **Balanced Tone:** I maintain a polite and persuasive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I need to be honest with you, I'm really struggling to go above that price. Can we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 2 rounds left, there is a high chance that we will not be able to reach an agreement with Bob. 
* **Price is too low:**  $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is my minimum desired value for the product. 
* **Risk of further rejection:** If I reject Bob's offer again, there's no guarantee he will make a counteroffer that I will find acceptable.

It's time to secure the guaranteed sale to John and move on."
