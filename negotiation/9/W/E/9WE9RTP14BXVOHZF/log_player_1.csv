Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start the negotiation with Bob at a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer of $950,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring you earn significantly more than his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Justification of value:** The message implies the product's worth without explicitly stating your minimum acceptable price. This approach aims to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to accept the offer."
