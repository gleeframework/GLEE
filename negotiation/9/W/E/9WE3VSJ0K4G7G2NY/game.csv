"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I could meet you at $725,000. This offer represents a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
