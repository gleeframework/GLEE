Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significant profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, and starting high gives me space to lower the price slightly while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message is positive and positions the product as valuable, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation skills, I might be willing to lower the price closer to my minimum of $10,000."
