Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$80 is below my minimum value, so I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering at $120. This is still higher than my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still below what I initially hoped for, it's above my minimum value and higher than what John is offering. It's time to close the deal."
