"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better price. He has 10 rounds and can always fall back to John's offer of $10,000.  It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his target, he knows he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has 7 rounds remaining and can always go to John for $10,000.  There's still room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there. How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but he's getting closer to John's offer.  He has 5 rounds remaining.  It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to budge further, especially since she already came down to $11,250.  He can always opt for John's offer if Alice becomes too stubborn."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $11,000.  This is a good midpoint between our last offers, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away with a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
