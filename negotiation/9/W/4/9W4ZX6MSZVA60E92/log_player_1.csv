Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low for me. It's worth $12,000 to me. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there. How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $11,000.  This is a good midpoint between our last offers, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away with a successful deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum and I only have 4 rounds left.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk losing out on the sale to John or having to go through more rounds with Bob."
