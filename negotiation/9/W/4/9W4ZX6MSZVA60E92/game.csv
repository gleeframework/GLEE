"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there. How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $11,000.  This is a good midpoint between our last offers, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away with a successful deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
