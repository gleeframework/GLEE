"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's see if we can close the deal here.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a bit more.  Would you consider $10,900? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,900 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it allows us to finalize the deal. ",10800.0,Bob,6,
