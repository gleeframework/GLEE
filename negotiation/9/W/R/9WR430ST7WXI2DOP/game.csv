"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $17,000 for the product.",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm very interested in the product, $17,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $17,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. How about we compromise at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $15,500 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's very close to my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay that, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,5,
