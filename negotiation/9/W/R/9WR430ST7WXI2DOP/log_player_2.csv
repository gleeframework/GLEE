# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $17,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $17,000 is more than his maximum budget.  He'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm very interested in the product, $17,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $17,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. How about we compromise at $16,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice is willing to compromise, $16,500 is still higher than his maximum budget. He'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $15,500 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's very close to my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay that, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit. He's willing to pay $15,000, but Alice is insistent on $16,000.  Since he has 10 rounds to close a deal, and John is willing to sell for $15,000, it's more advantageous to buy from John."
