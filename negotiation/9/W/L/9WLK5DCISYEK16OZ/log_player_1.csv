Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it, but I am hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the value here. While $1,000,000 represents my initial asking price, I'm willing to meet you partway.  How about we settle at $950,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I would like to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still comfortably above John's offer, and Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and willing to move towards my price.  There's room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. How about we split the difference at $937,500? That's a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my perspective. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $930,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is negotiating in smaller increments now, signaling we're getting close to his upper limit. Accepting at $930,000 secures a strong profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
