You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. 

While you risk her walking away from the deal, you have John as a backup option.  John's price of $1,500,000 acts as your maximum limit."
