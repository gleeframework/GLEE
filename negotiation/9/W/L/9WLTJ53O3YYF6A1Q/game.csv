"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1200000 is a significant offer, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this opportunity.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
