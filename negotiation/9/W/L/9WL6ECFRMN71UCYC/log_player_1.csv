Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** My goal is to maximize profit, so I want to sell the product for as much as possible. 
* **Risk:** I know John will pay $1,000,000, so offering less than that would be foolish.
* **Strategy:**  I'm offering $1,500,000, a significant premium above John's offer. This allows for some negotiation space and increases the potential for a higher profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Uncertainty:** I don't know Bob's valuation of the product. He might be willing to pay more than John, or he might not be interested at all.
* **Potential Reward:**  By setting a higher price, I have the chance to earn significantly more than John's offer.
* **Limited Risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

This strategy balances the desire for maximum profit with the need to avoid losing out on a guaranteed sale."
