"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I think you might be the right person. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in your product but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8000 is below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $10000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go up to $12000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,6,
