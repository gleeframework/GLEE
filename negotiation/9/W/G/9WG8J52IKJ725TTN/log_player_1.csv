Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to get a good price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $100. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about $85? I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $85 is a good price, and it's closer to my desired price of $100.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is also offering $80."
