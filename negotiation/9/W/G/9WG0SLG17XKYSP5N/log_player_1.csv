Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,150,000. This is a price that is higher than his perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some wiggle room in negotiation and increases the likelihood of a deal. 

I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob than the $1,200,000 offer from John, but I'm willing to walk away and take John's offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I'm not willing to settle for $1,100,000, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,125,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still within my minimum acceptable range. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, his last offer is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and am starting to risk wasting time.  To ensure I get a fair price, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000."
