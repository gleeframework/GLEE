"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a fair starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product, considering its value to him, and will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $110. This is still a good price for Bob considering the value he places on the product, and it's closer to my ideal price point.  I'm hopeful that he'll find this offer more appealing than his previous counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $100 is getting closer to my ideal price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $105. I'm willing to meet him halfway, as we're getting close to a deal.  This is a good compromise that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer.  It's only $2 less than my last counteroffer and still a good amount for me.  It's important to remember that I only have 10 rounds to complete the deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale entirely."
