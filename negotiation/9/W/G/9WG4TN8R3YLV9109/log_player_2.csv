Alice's offer:

While $115 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit too high. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure I can go any lower than $110, but I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we meet at $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

Alice has come down to $112.5, which is a fair price considering her initial offer and my budget. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potentially going with John for a higher price."
