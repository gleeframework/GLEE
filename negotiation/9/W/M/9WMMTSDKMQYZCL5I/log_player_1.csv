"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and ensures I'm not selling it for less than my minimum value.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and find a middle ground. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I'm starting to get concerned that we might not reach an agreement, but I'm still hopeful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $14,000. It's still above my minimum value, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to move closer to a reasonable price.  If this fails, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum. I'm running out of time, but I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value yet. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $12,000. It's still above my minimum but I'm really starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'm hoping this is a good compromise, but if Bob rejects this I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. We are only two rounds away from the end and Bob is not willing to pay more than $10,000, which is still below my minimum.  It's better to secure the $15,000 from John and avoid the risk of losing everything."
