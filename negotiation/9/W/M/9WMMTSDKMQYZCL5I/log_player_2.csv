Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is enticing, it's still above your budget.  There are only 3 rounds left, so it's important to push for a better price.  Even if Alice rejects the next counteroffer, you'll have the option to buy from John in the final round."
