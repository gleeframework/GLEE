"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value you've described. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This price reflects the product's true value and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1000000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
