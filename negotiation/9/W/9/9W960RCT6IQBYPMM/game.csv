"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than what I'd be willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're serious about buying the product, I suggest you take this offer.  Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $890,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $890,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $882,500?",882500.0,Bob,6,
