"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value, and I want to see if Bob is truly interested in making a serious purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  $1,500,000 is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the potential for future profits. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to make a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I would ideally like to sell for more, it's getting late in the negotiation, and accepting his offer ensures I get my desired value. I'm also avoiding the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower offer or a complete breakdown."
