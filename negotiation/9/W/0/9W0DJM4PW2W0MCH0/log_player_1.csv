Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's not an unreasonable markup given the product's worth to me. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I believe I can potentially squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm offering $1,650,000.  It's a slight reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still above Bob's initial counteroffer. I believe this price is still attractive to Bob while allowing me to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price and is closer to my initial offer.  Accepting this offer ensures a good outcome for me and avoids further negotiation. It's also important to note that selling to John would net me less profit."
