Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer, offering $8,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and hopefully, it will encourage her to negotiate. I'm leaving room for potential compromise in future rounds."

Alice is still above my budget. I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,500.  I'll reject her offer and see if she'll come down further. I have enough rounds left to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and meet her halfway, while still staying within my budget. With only a few rounds left, I want to push for a deal."

Alice's offer is still too high, and with only a few rounds left, it's unlikely she'll come down further. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000 to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
