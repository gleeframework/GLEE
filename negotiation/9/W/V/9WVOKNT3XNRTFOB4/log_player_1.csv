"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Openness:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the interest, but I am only able to pay up to $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** While Bob's offer meets my minimum, it's still too low considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate further to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Value:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open. I can explore if Bob is willing to increase his offer.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I can always sell to John for $8,000 gives me a strong position during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a good price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,000.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""good price"" for both of us to make Bob feel like it's a win-win situation. 
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to keep the dialogue going and see if he's willing to move up from his $8,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet at $9000. I would like to propose $8500 as my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob has moved up from his initial $8,000 offer. This shows he's willing to negotiate and might be closer to meeting my desired price.
* **Time Constraint:**  With 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer gives me a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net,  $8,500 is a better deal and worth accepting, considering the limited time."
