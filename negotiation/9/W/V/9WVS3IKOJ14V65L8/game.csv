"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this product is a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and accepting $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While $950000 is closer to my desired price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $975000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this price is a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $975000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $925000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
