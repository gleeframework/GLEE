I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is significantly above my minimum value of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value and doesn't reflect the true worth of the product.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter Bob with a price of $1,200,000. This is still a significant amount of money, but it's a compromise from my original offer. I'm hoping this will be a more reasonable number for Bob, while still being a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still not close to my minimum value.  Given that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, it's better to cut my losses and secure the sale with John."
