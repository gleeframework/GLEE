Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get a price closer to your ideal. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While I know Bob values it at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 (John), ensuring I won't be forced to go below my minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob depending on his response and potentially lower the price to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
