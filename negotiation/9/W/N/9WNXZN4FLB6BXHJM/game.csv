"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still allows you a good profit margin. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $950,000 still leaves me at a loss. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and hopefully allow us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",960000.0,Bob,6,
