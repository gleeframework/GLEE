**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly set at $1,030,000.  We've reached a point of diminishing returns in the negotiation. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to John's standing offer. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
