``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum of $1,200,000. I'm also framing the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the value and potential benefits for Bob."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
