Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer price allows me to potentially maximize my profit if Bob is willing to pay more than the minimum ($100). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, giving me a chance to still get a price higher than my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100, so there's no risk of being left with the product."
