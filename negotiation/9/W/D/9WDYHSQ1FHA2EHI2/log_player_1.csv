Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than $15,000 from Bob. I know it's worth at least that much to me, but I'm hoping for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $18,000 for this product. It's unique and offers significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $16500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,500 is a good deal considering I'm already above my minimum threshold of $15,000. There's a good chance Bob won't budge further, and it's better to secure this offer than risk losing the sale and having to settle for the same amount with John."
