Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can then negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's initial offer, which shows I'm willing to negotiate."
