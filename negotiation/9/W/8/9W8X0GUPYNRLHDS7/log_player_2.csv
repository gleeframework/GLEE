"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum price is $12,000, and Alice's offer is $11,500, it makes sense to try to negotiate further. There's room for a potential lower price, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $11,500 is a bit more than I was hoping for, though. How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 11500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $11,500, it's still above his target of $12,000. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being willing to compromise.  $11,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at 10750, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the value I think the product brings. How about we meet at 10900? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is the lowest she's gone so far, and it's within Bob's budget. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that the negotiation will drag on. At this point, it's better for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's still a good deal for him."
