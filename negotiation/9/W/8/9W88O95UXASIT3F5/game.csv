"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1000000. This is my final counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further, but I won't go below $1000000.
