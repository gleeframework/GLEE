Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer it to him for $140.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $130 is lower than my initial offer of $140, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a new counteroffer to try to get closer to my minimum price of $140.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $130, I'll try to get a bit closer to my minimum price of $140. I'll offer him $135.
