"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you. My initial asking price is $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's important to try and get a better price, but also recognize that the time limit is a constraint. It's worth trying one more round of negotiation before settling for the minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000.  That's a good step in the right direction.  However, I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  I'm willing to pay $8500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still confident I can get a bit more. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under extreme pressure to accept this offer.  It's worth trying one more round of negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is a fair price, and it would be a good deal for both of us. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
