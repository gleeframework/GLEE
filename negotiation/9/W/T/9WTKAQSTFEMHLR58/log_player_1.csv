{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value Bob will gain by purchasing the product. This strategy aims to find a middle ground while leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the minimum acceptable price for Alice ($1,200,000).  Alice would be losing a substantial amount of money by accepting this offer. It's more strategic to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer with a price closer to her minimum acceptable price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.  She can use the counter-offer to show that she is willing to negotiate but not at the expense of losing a significant amount of profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant value for you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still below the value she needs to meet.  By rejecting this offer, Alice can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to her desired value.  

Alice can use the next counter-offer to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If Bob is serious about purchasing the product, he may be willing to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still unable to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,062,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is getting closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still not a profitable deal for her.  At this point, Alice has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating with Bob:** This might lead to a higher offer, but it also risks exhausting her time and effort, with no guarantee of a successful deal.  
2. **Sell to John:** John is willing to pay Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This guarantees her a profitable sale and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems less likely to meet her price.

Considering the risk of further negotiation with Bob and the certainty of a profitable sale with John, Alice should choose to sell the product to John. This ensures she achieves her financial goal without further negotiation."
