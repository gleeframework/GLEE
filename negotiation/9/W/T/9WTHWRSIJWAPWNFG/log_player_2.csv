"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should definitely negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $80 for this product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $80 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong starting point to see how much she's willing to negotiate.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely and explains that your budget is limited, which could encourage Alice to work with you.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves plenty of space for counteroffers and a potential compromise that could still save you money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $130 exceeds your $100 budget. While Alice is moving towards a compromise, you can likely negotiate a better price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a $30 difference between your last offer and Alice's current one.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $100 if the negotiations don't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we try $95? I'm eager to make a deal, but I need to stick to my budget."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're increasing your offer, showing Alice you're willing to compromise but not by a large margin.
* **Staying Below Budget:** The $95 counteroffer keeps you below your $100 maximum, preserving potential savings. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning your eagerness to make a deal might encourage Alice to accept, especially if she's motivated to sell quickly."
