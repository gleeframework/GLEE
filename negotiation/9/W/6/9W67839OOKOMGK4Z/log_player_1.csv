Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

Bob's offer is a bit too low, but it's still closer to my desired price than John's offer. I'm going to try and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $10,800 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,150 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to propose a price of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to give one more round to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product.  I think this is a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting close to my target, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10,750. I'd like to propose a price of $10,400. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm not comfortable going any lower, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  John's offer is less than ideal, but it's a secure way to get a decent return on my product."
