Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

 I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  This still leaves you with a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. Accepting this offer is a better strategy than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $1,200,000."
