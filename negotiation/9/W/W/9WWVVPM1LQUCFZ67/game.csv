"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This represents a significant discount and a good starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the product's value while still providing you a substantial return on investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000. This shows my commitment to a deal while also reflecting the realistic value of the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  While $1,025,000 is a significant jump, I need to see this deal closer to my initial figures. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $1,062,500.  This is a compromise that shows my serious interest in finalizing this deal.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
