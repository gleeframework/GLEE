"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,500. That's a good step, but I still need to make a little more to make this work for me. How about we settle on $8,500? That's a good middle ground, and it's a fair price for the value the product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000.  It's in your best interest to secure the product at the guaranteed $8,000 price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
