{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it is above your minimum price of $100 but also leaves room for negotiation.  It shows Bob that you are serious about selling the product to him, but also that you are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could accept it and still make a profit, I am aiming for a better price.  I will counteroffer and try to reach a compromise closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately below what I'm able to accept for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can offer $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get more, this offer is still profitable and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
