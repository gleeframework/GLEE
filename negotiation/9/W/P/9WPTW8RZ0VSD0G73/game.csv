"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is tempting, it's below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?  I believe this price reflects the product's value and is fair for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is the closest I can get to my target. Can you consider this price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
