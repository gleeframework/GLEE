"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth $10000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget of $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer $10000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'd be happy to make the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is $10000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. If you're not willing to sell it to me for $10000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying it from John for the same price.",10000.0,Bob,8,
