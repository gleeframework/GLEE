"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand this product is valuable, but that initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this price reflects the value this product holds.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Let's settle this right now: $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to close the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  However, to be honest, $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  I value your willingness to find a compromise. How about we split the difference at $1,100,000?  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
