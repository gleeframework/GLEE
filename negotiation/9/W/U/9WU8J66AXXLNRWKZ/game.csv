"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only looking to spend $10000 on this product.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to come to an agreement. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to finally close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be as fair as possible.  $10500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again, at $10750?  This is a very reasonable price, and it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
