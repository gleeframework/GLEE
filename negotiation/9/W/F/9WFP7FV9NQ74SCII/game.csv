"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $12000. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I'm looking to save as much as possible, but I'm still interested in making a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $11000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $10000 is still below the product's value to you. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15000.",11500.0,Alice,5,
