"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to accept John's offer of $1,500,000. Since you aim to save as much as possible, rejecting this offer is the most strategic move."
