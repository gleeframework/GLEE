"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is too high.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Bob can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his ideal price. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  There's still room for bargaining, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go a little higher, but $1,100,000 is still too steep for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $1,075,000.
