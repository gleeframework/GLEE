"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me.  I'm starting relatively high, but I'm open to discussing a lower price if Bob is hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  Would you consider $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise.  It's still significantly more than selling to John, and it seems like Bob is serious about making a deal.  I'm happy to accept and close this transaction."
