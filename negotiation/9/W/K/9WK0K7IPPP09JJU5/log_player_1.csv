Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential,"" you aim to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's desire for a unique asset.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the product's worth can influence Bob's perception of its value. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit, but be mindful of not overpricing the product to the point where Bob walks away, leaving you with the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
