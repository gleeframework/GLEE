Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle somewhere above $15,000.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $19,000 seems like a more ""considered"" price than a round number like $20,000.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above $10,000."
