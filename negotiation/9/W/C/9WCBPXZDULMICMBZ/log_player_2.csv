"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm thinking of a price of $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards my $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than my actual limit. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially getting a great deal. Alice knows I'm willing to buy from John for $100, so there's an incentive for her to find a price we both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $70 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above my target. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand there's some middle ground to be found here Alice. How about $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price well below her current offer.  We're getting closer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $80 is the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her minimum price, which is a good deal for me and below my max budget.  It's time to accept and close the deal!"
