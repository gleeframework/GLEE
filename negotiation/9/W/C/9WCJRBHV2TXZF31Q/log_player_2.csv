"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,500 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,200, which is the closest I can get to your offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,200 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum.  Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get as close to your asking price as possible, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. If that's not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still a bit above my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $11,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at $11,000.**  This is still above Bob's ideal price of $10,500, but it's closer than the previous offer.
* **John's offer is at $12,000.**  This is significantly higher than Alice's offer.
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision for Bob in this round, even though it's not his ideal price."
