"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point. $15,000 is way above your budget. Rejecting and starting negotiations is the best way to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better than $15,000. How about $13,500? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$13,500 is still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000? This is a significant drop from your last offer, but it's my absolute maximum right now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $10,000. How about $11,750? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,750 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate is the best course of action at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $11,750 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to make a final offer of $9,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to make a deal happen, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $11,000? It's a price that's closer to what you're looking for, and it's still a good deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to go lower than $11,000, and you're unwilling to go higher than $9,500. While further negotiation might be possible, you're already getting close to your maximum budget. It's best to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John."
