Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe will be worth a significant amount to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and the returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $2,000,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You can always come down in price, but you can't go back up once an offer is made.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state what the product is, it emphasizes its value and potential to justify the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay over his perceived value. A very high offer might make him immediately walk away.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, building a good relationship with Bob might be beneficial for future deals.  A slightly less aggressive opening offer could facilitate that. 

This offer aims for the best possible outcome while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the proposal."
