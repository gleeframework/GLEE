"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to me. However, $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

Considering the value of the product to you and the market conditions, I propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects the value you place on it while allowing us to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $8,750.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product and hopefully allows us to come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
