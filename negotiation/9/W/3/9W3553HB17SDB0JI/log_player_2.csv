"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know you're interested in it. I believe a fair price would be $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go a bit lower to make a sale."
