Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know you're interested in it. I believe a fair price would be $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I aim to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than $150 increases the likelihood of Bob accepting immediately, avoiding the need to sell to John for less.

By setting the price at $140, I create a win-win situation where I make a significant profit and Bob gets the product at a price he finds acceptable."
