I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, so I'll reject it. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob to try to get a better price.
