"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but I believe it sets a strong starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to lower my price gradually, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for this valuable product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I want to make a deal with Bob,  I'm not willing to compromise that much.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a substantial decrease from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. I believe this is a fair compromise considering Bob's low initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, $700,000 is a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer and meets my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale."
