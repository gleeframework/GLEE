"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's original asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still allows me to cover my costs and leaves room for some profit.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has come down from her initial price, $10,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price again, potentially closer to his budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  I can come down to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good value.  I'm confident this is a deal that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is only willing to come down to $10,000. This is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, as this guarantees him the best price within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price."
