"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still allows me to cover my costs and leaves room for some profit.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering your cost and my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  I can come down to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good value.  I'm confident this is a deal that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
