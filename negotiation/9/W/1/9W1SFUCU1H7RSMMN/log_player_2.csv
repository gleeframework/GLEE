Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer now matches John's price. There's no point in further negotiation as it's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and John's price represents the maximum I'm willing to pay."
