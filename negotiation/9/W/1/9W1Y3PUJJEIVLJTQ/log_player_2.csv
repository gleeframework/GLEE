"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120, and Alice's offer is exactly $120, there's no benefit to negotiating further. You might as well buy from John, as there's no chance of getting a lower price from Alice."
