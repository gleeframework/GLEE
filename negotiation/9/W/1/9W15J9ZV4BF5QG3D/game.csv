"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $80. How about we try $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
