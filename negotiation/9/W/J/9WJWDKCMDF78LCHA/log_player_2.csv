Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $130. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.

While you could hold out for $120, getting the product for $130 is a reasonable compromise. You're saving $10 compared to John's offer, and further haggling might make Alice reconsider."
