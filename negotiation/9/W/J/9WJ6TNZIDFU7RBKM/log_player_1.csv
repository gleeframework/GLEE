"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, which is at least $15,000 to me.  I'm confident this product can bring you substantial benefits. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price.  There's a chance Bob might increase his offer if he really wants the product.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value the product at more than $15,000, I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  How about $17,500?  This would still leave me a reasonable profit, and it's significantly less than my initial offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $15,000, and we're already nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer or we might reach the end of the rounds with no deal.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
