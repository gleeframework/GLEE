{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if Bob can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, bringing the price down to $850,000. This is still above Bob's ideal price of $800,000, but it demonstrates Bob's serious intent to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. It also leaves room for some negotiation in future rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $975,000, which is closer to Bob's ideal price of $800,000. However, Bob still wants to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since he has several rounds remaining.  He can potentially reach a more favorable price by continuing the negotiation process."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is now very close to Bob's last offer of $925,000. This shows that the negotiation is nearing a compromise. Accepting this offer would allow Bob to acquire the product for a price that is within his budget and only $150,000 more than his ideal price of $800,000.  It's likely that further negotiations may not result in a significantly lower price, making it a better choice to accept the offer and close the deal."
