"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going all-in with my first offer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John is a backup:**  While I want to try to negotiate with Bob, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, considering your interest in the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  $95 is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. This demonstrates flexibility without sacrificing too much.
* **Reinforces value:**  I emphasize Bob's interest in the product to make him more likely to consider the counteroffer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage further and potentially reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95, which would be $87.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Continuing negotiations:**  I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my price, especially since I'm already halfway through the rounds. 
* **John is always an option:**  While I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, I have the secure option of selling to John for my minimum price if negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $87.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference one more time, and I'll come down to $91.25?  That seems like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 91.25} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting him halfway again, demonstrating a willingness to find common ground.
* **Positive framing:** I'm calling it a ""fair compromise"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm compromising, the price is still above Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $91.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $85. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the rounds, so I need to be cautious about accepting a low price.
* **John is a secure option:** I can still sell to John for a guaranteed $120 if negotiations with Bob fail. 
* **Room for one more counteroffer:** I'm willing to see if I can push Bob a little higher with one final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a price that works for us. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $89.  This is my final offer, as I'm running out of time. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last chance to compromise, adding urgency to the situation.
* **Small concession:**  I'm making a small concession to show flexibility, but still staying above Bob's last offer.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the limited time remaining to encourage a quick decision. 
* **Balanced approach:** While I'm pushing for a higher price, I'm still acknowledging Bob's position and leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $84. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the negotiation is getting increasingly risky, and the potential for a satisfactory outcome is dwindling.
* **Unrealistic expectation:** Bob's offer of $84 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **John provides certainty:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, eliminating the uncertainty of continued negotiations with Bob.

Even though I'm open to negotiation, I've already compromised significantly.  At this point, it's more prudent to secure a guaranteed sale with John than to risk losing out on a better deal by holding out for a higher price from Bob."
