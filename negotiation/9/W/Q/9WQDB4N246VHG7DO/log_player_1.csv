{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price. Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him, so he may counteroffer. I'll then have the chance to negotiate or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

While I'd like to get the $15,000,  $12,000 is still a reasonable price for me. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but still want to make a profit. $14,000 is a fair price considering Bob's offer and my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is only slightly higher than his initial offer.  I'm confident that I won't get a better deal with further negotiation, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
