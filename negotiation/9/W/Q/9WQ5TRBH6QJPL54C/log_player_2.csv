"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is far above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth rejecting and attempting to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90, which is still below my maximum budget of $100, but it's also a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my maximum budget of $100, but it's closer than her initial offer.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price again. I can still get the product for $100 from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to offer Alice my maximum price of $100.  This shows that I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I won't go any higher. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above my maximum budget of $100.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. I can get the product for $100 from John, which is a better deal for me."
