"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the significant value I believe this product holds. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $825000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable investment for me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
