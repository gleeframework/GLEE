Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and $900,000 falls quite short of what I can accept. Would you consider $1,075,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, his offer is still substantially lower than John's guaranteed offer.  The difference between $950,000 and $1,200,000 is too significant to risk further negotiation, especially since there's no guarantee Bob will meet the desired price point."
