"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and get a lower price. You can still get the product for less than $100 from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85 for the product. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's a fair price for both of us. It's below your maximum price, and it's above what Alice is willing to sell it for."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Alice's offer. Although it's lower than the original offer, I can still try to negotiate further to get a better price. I can still buy from John for $100 if I can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
``` 

I'm offering $87 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest offer. I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $89 is within my budget and a good deal considering I can still buy from John for $100. I'm willing to accept this offer."
