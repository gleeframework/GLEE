"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I understand it's a bit outside your budget, but  I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value and would still allow you to get a great deal. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find it a good deal considering the limited time we have left to close this deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
