"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make the offer seem more appealing.

I'm hoping that Bob will either accept the offer or make a counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate further. If he rejects my offer outright, I'll have to reassess my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not willing to sell at such a loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm willing to go down a bit, but not that much.
* **Option of Selling to John:** I have the option of selling to John for $100, which is still a good outcome. However, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll need to be careful not to push him away, but I'm determined to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I understand it's a bit outside your budget, but  I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value and would still allow you to get a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm coming down from $110 to $95, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. This is a significant concession, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging to maintain a positive rapport with Bob.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can move closer to a deal. However, I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find it a good deal considering the limited time we have left to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're already in Round 4, and Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers. It's clear he's not willing to budge much further.
* **Limited Potential Gain:**  Even if I were to make another counteroffer, there's no guarantee Bob would accept. The risk of further negotiation is high, and the potential gain is limited.
* **Guaranteed Outcome with John:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

While I would have liked to get a higher price, it's crucial to recognize when a deal is not going to happen. It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing."
