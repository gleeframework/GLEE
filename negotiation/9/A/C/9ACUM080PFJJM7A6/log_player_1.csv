"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to $11,500. Selling to John at this point wouldn't be ideal as it leaves potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10,750?  This price would still leave us both with a profitable deal. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $10,500. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $10,000. While it's getting closer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Selling to John at this point would mean sacrificing any potential profit above $10,000. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $10,600? This would allow us both to close the deal and still make a fair profit. It's time to make a decision, as we only have 5 rounds left."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $10,550 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,550 is just above my minimum price of $10,000. While I would have preferred a higher price, we are down to the final few rounds and it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better offer.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and at least some profit."
