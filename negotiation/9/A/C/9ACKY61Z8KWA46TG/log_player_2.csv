"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm offering it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is a good price, but not a steal.**  You want to see if you can get it lower.
* **You have 10 rounds.**  There's time to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is a safety net.** You can always go that route if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! $90 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.  
* **Leaves room for compromise:** It's not so low that Alice is likely to immediately reject it. This allows for back-and-forth.
* **Focuses on value:**  The message reinforces your interest in the product, suggesting a possible value justification for your lower offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $82? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:** She's moved closer to your price point, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **You're still above your target:** $82 is still more than you'd like to pay.
* **There's room for further negotiation:**  You can likely get the price down a bit more. 
* **You have rounds left:**  You can afford to keep negotiating without risking too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, appreciate you coming down.  $82 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it closer to my initial offer.  How about $78?  "", ""product_price"": 78}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant move:**  $78 is a small step closer to your desired price point, but it shows you're serious about getting the best deal.
* **Maintain momentum:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving without risking a complete breakdown. 
* **Stay within your limit:** $78 is still under your $150 maximum.
* **Reiterate interest:**  The message reinforces your interest in the product while reminding Alice of your initial offer, implying a potential value justification."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $81? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $81 is very close to your desired price range.
* **Limited negotiation room:** While you could try to squeeze out another dollar or two, it's unlikely Alice will go any lower, especially with the limited rounds remaining.
* **Avoiding risk:**  You're close enough to your target, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal or ending up with a worse price.
* **Safety net:** John's offer of $150 is always a backup if you need it.

**This is a good time to accept the offer and secure the product without risking losing it or paying a higher price.**"
