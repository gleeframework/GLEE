{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  It's still more than I'd get from John, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $9,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,500. How about we go with $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to $9,000, Bob's offer of $8,750 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly more than what I'd get from John, and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product. I'm going to accept his offer."
