"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm really hoping to make this work, and I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering you the product for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
