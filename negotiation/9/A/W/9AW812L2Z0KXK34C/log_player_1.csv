"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're confident in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,500 is close to my minimum, it's still below my desired earnings. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  $10,500 is my best price, considering the value of the product.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's be realistic - this product is worth $10,000 to you, and it's worth $10,000 to me. It's a win-win situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum price. It's a fair deal, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or the potential loss of time if I chose to sell to John."
