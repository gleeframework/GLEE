"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to see if you can get a better price.  Since you have a maximum budget of $10,000, and Alice is offering $5,000, there's room to negotiate. You should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to push for a good deal.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground between $3,000 and $5,000.  It's important to remember that Alice's value for the product is unknown, so this is a strategic starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price than $4,000, especially with 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $3,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Alice and potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $4,200 is getting closer to my desired price range. While I could continue negotiating, with only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases. It's becoming more likely that I'll have to buy from John for $10,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase for $4,200, which is a significant savings compared to John's price."
