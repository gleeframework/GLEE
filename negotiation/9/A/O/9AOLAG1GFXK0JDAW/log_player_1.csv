Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) while ensuring a sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 provides a safety net. You don't need to go below that price.

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
