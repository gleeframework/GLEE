"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1250000. This is a great price considering its value to you. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further.  If not, I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for a higher price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best financial decision."
