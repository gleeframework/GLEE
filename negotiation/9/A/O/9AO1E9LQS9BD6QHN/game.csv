"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is way out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000. Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $16000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm committed to getting this product, but my absolute maximum is $8000.  If that's not possible, I'll have to go with another seller.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
