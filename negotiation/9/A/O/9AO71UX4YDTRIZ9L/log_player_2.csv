"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to establish a strong negotiating position.  I'm offering $100, which is still within my budget and allows room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though! Would you be willing to pay $180 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $180 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $120. I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $150, which is a fair middle ground. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $100 to $150, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. This is still within my budget and hopefully closer to Alice's desired price point. I'm also emphasizing the potential for a deal to motivate Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $30 yet. I'm willing to come down to $170, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $170 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than my maximum of $120.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can push Alice down further. It's only round 5, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $170 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $160. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $160, which is still within my budget. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to create a sense of urgency for Alice to accept. If she doesn't, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John at $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $160 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $165 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $120. At this point, with only 3 rounds remaining, it's more efficient to simply buy the product from John at $120 and avoid further negotiation. I've already spent several rounds trying to get a lower price from Alice, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to achieve my desired price point.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product."
