"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than $8,000 (John's offer), I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to my ideal value.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
