"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the $10,000 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still higher than what the product is worth to her ($8,000). This shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a good deal.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows for further bargaining. Alice can accept, reject, or make a counteroffer.
* **Avoids Immediate Deal with John:**  While John offers the product for $10,000, Bob is trying to get a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is a better strategy at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** $9,000 is a fair compromise. It's a decent price for Bob, who values the product at $10,000, and it's higher than Alice's minimum of $8,000.
* **Avoids Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject again, and he might end up buying from John at $10,000. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 10 rounds, accepting now avoids the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John."
