"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects both the product's worth and your interest in it.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I can't accept anything less than $1,900,000. This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
