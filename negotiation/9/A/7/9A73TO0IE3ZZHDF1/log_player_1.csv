Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for more than $120.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  There's room for negotiation, giving Bob incentive to accept. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's also closer to your initial offer of $140, so there's a good chance you can close the deal.  It's more beneficial to secure a sale for $130 than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale to Bob or have to settle for the lower price from John."
