I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point, as it's a price that is lower than Bob's value but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price of $14,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $14,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than his value of $15,000. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 less than what John is willing to pay.  I'll take it, as it's better than selling to John and still above my minimum acceptable price."
