"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,150,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000. Would that work for you?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000 as a final compromise. This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
