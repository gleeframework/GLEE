**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $13,000 and it's unlikely he'll go much higher.  It's clear we're not going to reach a price point that significantly surpasses John's offer.  While $13,000 is more than $12,000, it's better to take the guaranteed offer from John now rather than risk Bob walking away and getting stuck with an even lower offer or no deal at all."
