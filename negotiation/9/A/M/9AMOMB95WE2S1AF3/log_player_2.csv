"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a fair price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than her value of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. To make this work for me, I'd need to come in lower. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product with your desired price range. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my desired price range. I want to save as much money as possible. I will reject her offer and counter with a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go quite that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is a price that I believe is still a good compromise. This price takes into account the value you've placed on the product and my minimum selling price. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my desired range.  It's also significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's a good compromise and a better deal than going with John.  I'll accept Alice's offer."
