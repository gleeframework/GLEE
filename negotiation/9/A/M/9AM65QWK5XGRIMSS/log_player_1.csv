"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?"", ""product_price"": 10250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,800 is cutting it too close.  My final offer is $10,000.  This offer stands until the end of round 6 - if you don't accept by then, I'll need to offer it to John."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900

This is a good spot to take the deal.  Bob is unlikely to go higher, and $9,900 is a good price. Holding out for the extra $100 risks losing the deal entirely."
