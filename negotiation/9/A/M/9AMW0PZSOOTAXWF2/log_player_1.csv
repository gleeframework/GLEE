Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to play with.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's enticing to Bob but still nets you a significant profit.  Aiming high initially gives you room to negotiate down if needed.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 secures you $150,000 above your minimum and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential"" subtly reminds Bob why he values it at $1,200,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone implies you're open to discussing the price further if Bob has concerns.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. You could start even higher, but be prepared to justify the price and potentially negotiate down."
