"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $145. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $145 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",135.0,Bob,6,
