"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we bring the price down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a little high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. That's a fair deal considering John is also offering me the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to balance your budget with the value the product would bring to you. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a discount from my initial offer.
