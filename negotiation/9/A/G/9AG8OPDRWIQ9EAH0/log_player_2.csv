"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $600,000 is lower than my initial price, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and provides you with a significant opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground.

At this point, Alice is no longer offering a price that's better than your alternative option.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, and it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
