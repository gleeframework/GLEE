"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $17,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but how about $15,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
