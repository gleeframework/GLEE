"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about we meet at $10,500? This gives you a good deal, and it leaves me some room to negotiate further.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us to finally close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,875 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,950. This is a fair price considering how close we are to a deal. It's just a small difference, let's see if we can find common ground.",9950.0,Alice,7,
