Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially since I know the product is worth more to Bob than he's currently offering."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm getting a little impatient with the negotiation and want to move the price higher. There are only a few rounds left and I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000."
