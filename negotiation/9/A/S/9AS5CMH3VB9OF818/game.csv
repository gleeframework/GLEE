"Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
