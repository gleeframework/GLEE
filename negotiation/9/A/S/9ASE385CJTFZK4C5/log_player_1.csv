Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) and higher than what it's worth to Bob ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's favorable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $155, which is still a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while also ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell to John to ensure a profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
