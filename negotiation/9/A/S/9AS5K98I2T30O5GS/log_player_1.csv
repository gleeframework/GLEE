Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information you've provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Knowing its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Create Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to make a decision without excessive deliberation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly negotiation-averse, you could start closer to his perceived value.
* **Market Dynamics:**  While John provides a safety net, are there other potential buyers who might offer more than $1,200,000?
* **Relationship Value:**  Is a strong long-term relationship with Bob more important than squeezing every dollar out of this deal? 

This offer aims for a strong initial position while acknowledging the complexities of negotiation."
