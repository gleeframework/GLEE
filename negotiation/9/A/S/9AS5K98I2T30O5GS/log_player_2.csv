"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Knowing its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $1,500,000.** 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John for $1,500,000, which is within your budget.** 

Even though John's price is higher than Alice's, it's still within your limit, and rejecting Alice's offer gives you a better deal."
