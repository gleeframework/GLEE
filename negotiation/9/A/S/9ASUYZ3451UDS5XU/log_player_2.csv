"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her own valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you leverage to either get a better deal from Alice or proceed with your guaranteed purchase from John."
