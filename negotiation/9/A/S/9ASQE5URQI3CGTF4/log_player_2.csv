"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find really useful. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, it's still above your target of $150. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to do $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $125. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $125 is within your budget and represents a good deal. It's lower than John's price and allows you to save money. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying John's higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without taking any unnecessary risks."
