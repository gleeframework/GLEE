"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Alice's minimum value. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, your product is appealing, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a significant profit while still representing a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider a more reasonable offer. For your convenience, I propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This still represents a substantial profit for me while offering you a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to secure a price closer to his target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $875,000. This would represent a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your position, Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $890,000 for the product. This remains a profitable deal for me and offers you an attractive value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is now very close to Bob's target price of $875,000.  It's a good deal for both parties.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away from the deal or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a fair price and avoids further negotiation."
