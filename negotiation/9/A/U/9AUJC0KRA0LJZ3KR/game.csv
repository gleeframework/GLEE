"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $80 right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $200 is already a steal for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still too high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go above $100. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm trying to be flexible, but $100 is just too low. This item is worth a lot more. My final offer is $120.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,6,
