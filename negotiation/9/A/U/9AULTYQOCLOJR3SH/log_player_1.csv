Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has immense potential for you as well. I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $1,500,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe the product holds more value and I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price.  I still have 8 rounds to go before I have to consider selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true potential of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is fair, and it allows us both to secure a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. Can you consider this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I'd like to receive, I still have 6 rounds left and I believe I can potentially get a better price. It's not worth risking it for only a $100,000 difference."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, I can't go any lower than $1,300,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of this product and the potential it offers. Let's meet in the middle, and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We've reached a stalemate, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm going to make one final compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's finalize this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob and I are at an impasse. I've already made significant compromises, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,275,000.  While $1,220,000 is a decent amount, I'm concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, he'll just keep lowering his counteroffers, ultimately forcing me to settle for less than I want. 

To avoid this situation and secure a sale, I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Although this is a lower price than I initially hoped for, it guarantees a sale and prevents me from risking further negotiation with Bob, which could result in an even lower price."
