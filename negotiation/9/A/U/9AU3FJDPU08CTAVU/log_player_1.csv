Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that is higher than your minimum but still lower than Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation, but also signals that you're not willing to give it away for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80 if possible. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more from Bob. Bob has shown that he's interested and willing to pay something close to your desired price. It's likely that you can negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to lower the price to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to your minimum and is still a better deal than selling to John. It's worth accepting this offer to finalize the sale and secure the profit."
