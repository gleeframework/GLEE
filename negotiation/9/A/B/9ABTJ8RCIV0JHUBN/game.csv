"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves a significant profit for you.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
