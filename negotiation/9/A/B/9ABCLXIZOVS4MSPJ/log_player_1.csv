Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further, but this initial offer sets a strong starting point.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll be prepared to make counter-offers, but I'll keep in mind my minimum acceptable price ($15,000 from John) and the potential for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That product looks great but $12,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a major loss. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested.  This means there's potential for a counter-offer that could be more favorable.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I have a guaranteed buyer in John, which gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter-offer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired price range but still acknowledges his lower offer.  I'll aim for a price closer to $10,000, considering the $15,000 offer from John.
* I'll remain prepared to sell to John if negotiations with Bob become too difficult or time-consuming."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $10,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $10,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying it's a ""fair compromise."" 
* **Keeping the Door Open:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while still pushing towards a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.
* If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. 
* If I decide to continue negotiating, I'll need to think carefully about my next move and whether I'm willing to go lower than $10,000."
