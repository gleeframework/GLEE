"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $8,500. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for $10,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and my original offer of $10,000. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",9750.0,Alice,5,
