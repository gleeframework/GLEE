"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, which I know is worth more to me. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to your business. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
