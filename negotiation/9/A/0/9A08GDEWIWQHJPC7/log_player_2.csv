This is a fantastic price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is significantly higher than John's offer. Even though Alice claims the product is worth $800,000 to you, you know you can get it for that price from John.  Buying from John saves you a considerable amount of money."
