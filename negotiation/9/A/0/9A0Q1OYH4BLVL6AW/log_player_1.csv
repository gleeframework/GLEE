Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm optimistic that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my floor price, as the product is worth more to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'd prefer to try and get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  $13,000 is the best I can do right now.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a price closer to my desired price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $12,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm coming down to $13,000. That's really the best I can do, given the value of this product. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm sticking with $13,000 for now. It's closer to my minimum price, and I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and come to an agreement. I'm getting closer to my desired price, and I'm ready to see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's time to secure the sale."
