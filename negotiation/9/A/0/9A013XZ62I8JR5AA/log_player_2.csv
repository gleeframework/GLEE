"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $14,000. This is a savings of $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You're still getting a deal:** While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good deal considering your own valuation and Alice's willingness to sell below her own value."
