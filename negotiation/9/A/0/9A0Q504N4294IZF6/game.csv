"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to consider $17000? I believe that's a fair price given my budget and the value of the product.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $17000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $19000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product's value. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $19000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $18000?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can come to an agreement at that price.",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of meeting you at $18500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18500, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go to $18250.  That's the very best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",18250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18250 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of meeting you at $18000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're going to miss the opportunity to sell the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,7,
