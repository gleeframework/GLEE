"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $1300000. This price still allows you to gain considerable value from this product. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $1200000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
