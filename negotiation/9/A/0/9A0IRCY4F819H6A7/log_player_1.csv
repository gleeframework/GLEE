Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and you'll get a lot of value out of it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum but still lower than the value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's better to try and get closer to the $100 price point, as Bob has shown he's willing to pay more than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to try for a higher price, Bob has clearly stated this is his final offer. Accepting $92 is a better outcome than selling to John for $80."
