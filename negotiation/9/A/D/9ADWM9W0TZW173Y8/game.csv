"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $12200.

"I can see we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, just like you suggested. I'll sell the product to you for $11500.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10800, but no further. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",10800.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $12000. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.
