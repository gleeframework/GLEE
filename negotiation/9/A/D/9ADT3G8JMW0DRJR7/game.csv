"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $16500. I think this price is a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $16000 again, but this time I'll throw in a sweetener: I'll include a 5% discount on the price, making it $15200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",15200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the discount, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $15200. I'm willing to meet you at $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to go as low as $12500, Bob. I'm not willing to meet you at that price, but I'll make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and my initial offer of $18000, which is $13250. I'll also throw in a 2-year warranty on the product, which is a $1000 value. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the warranty offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $13250. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",11000.0,Bob,10,
