"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
