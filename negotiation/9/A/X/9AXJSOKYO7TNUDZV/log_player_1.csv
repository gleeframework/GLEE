Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's particularly interested, but still ensures I get more than my minimum ($150) if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  It's important to price aggressively, knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John if Bob declines."
