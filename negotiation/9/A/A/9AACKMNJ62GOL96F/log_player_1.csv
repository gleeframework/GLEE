"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting it as a ""great deal.""
* **Open-ended question:**  This encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price ($150) as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $125 is significantly below my minimum price of $150.  
* **Opportunity to improve:** I can still potentially get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. 
* **No risk of losing out:** I have the option to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $125 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $135 to $140. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm using language that suggests a willingness to compromise further. 

By offering $140, I'm still making a profit while keeping the negotiation open for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $130 is still below my minimum price of $150.  While I'm getting closer to my target, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet.
* **Potential for improvement:** I can still try to push for a higher price.
* **Safeguard:**  I have the option to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

I'm going to counteroffer Bob again, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135.  This is a fair price that takes into account both of our perspectives. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing continued flexibility by lowering my price from $140 to $135.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm explicitly stating that $135 is a ""halfway"" compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive framing:** I'm re-emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price and using positive language to encourage acceptance. 

This counteroffer keeps me above my minimum price while still showing willingness to reach a deal. I'm confident that $135 is a fair price, and I'm hopeful that Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go down to $132? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While $132 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150.
* **Limited room for improvement:** The negotiation is getting tighter, and I'm not sure how much further Bob will go. 
* **Safeguard:** I can always sell to John for $150.  This is my safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls apart.

I'm going to counteroffer Bob one last time, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum. I want to see if I can get Bob to accept a price that's more favorable to me. If he rejects this final counteroffer, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's make this final offer. I'm willing to drop to $134.  I believe this is a fair price that considers both of our positions. It's our last chance to come to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 134}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final counteroffer, adding pressure to Bob to reach a deal.
* **Close to minimum:**  $134 is very close to my minimum price of $150, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to common ground:** I'm again emphasizing ""fairness"" and a ""mutual"" agreement.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John and secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $131. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low:** Bob's offer of $131 is still below my minimum price of $150.
* **Limited time:** This is my last chance to secure a deal. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** By selling to John, I'm guaranteed a price of $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I can't afford to risk accepting a price below my minimum.  I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer, and I'm ready to move on."
