Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $15,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $14,500 is too low for me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $14,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000, which would be $15,000. Can we discuss further to see if we can meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $15,000 is my minimum price and I've already used 4 rounds. It's time to close the deal."
