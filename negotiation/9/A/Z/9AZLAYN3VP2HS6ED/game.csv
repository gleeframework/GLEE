"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $15,500?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $14,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000, which would be $15,000. Can we discuss further to see if we can meet at this price?",15000.0,Bob,4,
