Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and potential budget while also setting a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still fair considering I'm willing to walk away with $1,000,000 from John.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum, and I'm not sure how much more I can push him. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale without risking a further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or a sale to John at a lower price."
