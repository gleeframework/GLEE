"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm asking for $200 to start."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the product's worth to me. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which matches my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to sell it to John now.  It avoids further negotiation and potential losses.
