{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's final offer of $920,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, it's getting close. With only a few rounds left, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. I'm also concerned about the risk of losing the opportunity entirely and having to buy from John at a much higher price. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still within my budget."
