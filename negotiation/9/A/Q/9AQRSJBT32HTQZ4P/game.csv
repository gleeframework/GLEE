"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering your own valuation and my willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850000, which is closer to my target price and a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $925000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900000, which is a compromise on both our ends.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $920000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,7,
