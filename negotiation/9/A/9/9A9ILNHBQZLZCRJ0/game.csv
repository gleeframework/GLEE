"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but  $1,800,000 is not it. How about $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly undervaluing the product and its potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I could consider a price closer to $750,000 if that works for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is still quite low considering the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
