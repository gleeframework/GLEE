"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its significance to you. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've proposed. I would like to make a counteroffer of $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum, but still reasonable for you. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I must adhere to my budget constraints. I am willing to increase my offer to $1000000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1200000, which is still a compromise, but one that I think is more in line with the product's value. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
