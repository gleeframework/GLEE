Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum, but still reasonable for you. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1200000, which is still a compromise, but one that I think is more in line with the product's value. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.
