"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm confident this offer represents a fair deal, and I'm open to discussing it further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a slightly higher price. Would you be willing to consider $890,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",880000.0,Bob,6,
