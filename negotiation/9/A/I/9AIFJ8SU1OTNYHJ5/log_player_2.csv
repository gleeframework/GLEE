"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room for both of you to find a price that works.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows you are serious about getting a good deal and that you are willing to negotiate. It is also a price that is still within your budget, giving you room to move up in price if necessary.  The goal is to find a price that works for both of you and maximizes your savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial counteroffer but still lower than her initial offer. This shows that she is willing to negotiate. It is likely that you can still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially closer to your desired price. Buying from John for $12,000 is still an option, but negotiating with Alice could lead to a better price for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's latest offer but still keeps the price lower than she is currently offering. This demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still trying to save money. The offer is also within your budget, leaving room to increase it if necessary."
