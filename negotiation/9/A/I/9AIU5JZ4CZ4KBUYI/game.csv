"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a reasonable midpoint that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
