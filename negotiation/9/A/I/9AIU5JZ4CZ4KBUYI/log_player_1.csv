Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a reasonable midpoint that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good deal. It's within my minimum acceptable price range, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
