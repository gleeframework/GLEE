"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at over $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My starting price is $950000, reflecting its high quality and potential. I'm open to negotiation, so let's discuss.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000, which reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's work together to find a deal that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm prepared to lower my price to $900000. This represents a significant adjustment and leaves room for further negotiation. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still slightly higher than where I'm comfortable at this point. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $875000?  This shows my genuine interest in your product, and it's a price that reflects its value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $875000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. However, I am willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $890000? This represents a good compromise and offers you a significant value for the product. Let's close this deal and move forward.",890000.0,Alice,5,
