You can do better than $110. You're willing to pay up to $120, but you should try to get it for less. Let's see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer of $112.5 is a good compromise. While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, you risk her walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
