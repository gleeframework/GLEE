"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you think it's impressive. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from this product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could we settle on $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from this product and is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
