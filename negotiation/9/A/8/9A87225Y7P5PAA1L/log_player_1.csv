"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a decent starting point considering the product is worth at least $100 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not willing to sell for that, but I'll counter with a price closer to what I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering at $120. This is still a good price for me and hopefully it's enticing enough for Bob to consider. I'm trying to meet halfway, but I'm not willing to go lower than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'll counter again, but I'm getting close to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110. This is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've already had several rounds of back and forth with Bob, and I'm not confident he'll go any higher.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm better off selling to John for $100 and guaranteeing a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
