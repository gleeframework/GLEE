Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to get you to lower the price. 
* **Limited-Time Offer:** By mentioning another buyer (John), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:** While you don't want to undervalue the product, you also don't need to provide an elaborate justification for the high price.  A simple statement about its value sets the stage for negotiation.

It's important to strike a balance between ambition and realism. While you want to maximize your profit, asking for an exorbitantly high price might make Bob lose interest completely. This offer aims to find that sweet spot."
