"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're making a concession, but I'm still a bit far off from that number.  Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not that far apart. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,475,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
