"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm prepared to sell for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that reflects the value of the product while allowing for a smooth transaction.  Let me know if you're willing to move closer to this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a figure that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that recognizes your interest while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
