"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get a better deal from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, especially since she seems eager to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$11,000 is still above Bob's budget. He should reject this offer and continue negotiating with Alice.  He might be able to get a better price, and he still has time to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice keeps offering prices above Bob's budget. Even though he has rounds left, the negotiations seem stuck.  It's time to move on and buy from John for a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
