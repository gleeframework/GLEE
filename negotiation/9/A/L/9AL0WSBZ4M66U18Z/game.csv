"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. My counteroffer is $11250. I'm willing to stretch my budget to get this product, but I need to be reasonable.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $11250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my bottom line. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $13000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $11000. I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $13000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. So, the total value you'll be getting is $14000. I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extra service you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. My counteroffer is $12000. I'm willing to stretch my budget to get the product, but I need to be reasonable.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to stretch your budget, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. However, I'm willing to throw in an additional service that's worth $500 on top of the previous $1000, making it a total of $1500 in extras. This brings the total value to $14500. I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional services you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already stretched my budget as much as I can, and I need to prioritize my financial constraints. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My final counteroffer is $11500. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider purchasing the product from you.",11500.0,Bob,10,
