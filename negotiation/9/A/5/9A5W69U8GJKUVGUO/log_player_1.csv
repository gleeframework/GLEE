Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you first dibs on a unique product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have other interested parties. Let me know your decision soon!"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and exclusivity (""unique,"" ""potential,"" ""limited-time"") to justify the high price.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency (""other interested parties,"" ""decision soon"") encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, a very high offer might discourage Bob entirely.  It's a calculated risk based on the information provided."
