"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. While it's still more than the product's value to Alice, it's within Bob's budget and saves him $300,000."
