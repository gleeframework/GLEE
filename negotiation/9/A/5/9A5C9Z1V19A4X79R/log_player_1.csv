Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards his valuation of $1,000,000. While we are getting closer, there's still a chance to negotiate a better price. We are only on round 6 and have room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're nearing a point where we can make a deal. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, demonstrating my commitment to finding common ground."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are moving towards the later rounds of negotiation, and it's time to incentivize Bob. This offer is a substantial concession,  signaling that we are getting closer to our bottom line while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still trying to make a business case for a lower price. How about we try $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move much further from his $1,000,000 valuation. Accepting $1,300,000 at this stage secures a healthy profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him dropping his offer closer to $1,000,000 in the final rounds."
