"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's well below its true worth. I'm confident that you'll find this proposition compelling. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
