"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate, especially when you have an alternative option (buying from John). By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can explore if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering significantly lower than Alice's initial price, Bob sets the stage for negotiation. 
* **Showing Interest:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer and shows Bob is interested in the product, but not at the full price.
* **Realistic Offer:** $7,500 is a reasonable starting point, allowing for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a little to $8500.  That's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's counteroffer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  Bob can aim for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $7,500, potentially in the $8,000 range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit high.  Would you be willing to do $8,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise, but still aims for a price closer to his initial offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the progress made and emphasizes the potential for a ""fair"" price for both parties.
* **Specific Number:** Instead of simply saying ""lower,"" Bob provides a concrete price point for Alice to consider."
