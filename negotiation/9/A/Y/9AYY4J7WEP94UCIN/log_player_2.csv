Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite there yet. I can offer you a slight reduction to $960,000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems to be stuck in the $950,000+ range. Her latest offer is even higher than her previous one, suggesting she might not be willing to go much lower. At this point, it's unlikely we'll get a deal significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000. Cutting our losses and buying from John guarantees the best price without further risk of negotiation."
