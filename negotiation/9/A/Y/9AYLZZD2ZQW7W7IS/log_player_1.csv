Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering the product at $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining.
* **Unknown Value:**  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting high to see if he's willing to pay a premium. 
* **Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, which allows me to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if his counteroffers are too low. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.  
* **Safety Net:**  Even if the negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Signaling Flexibility:**  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price. 

I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to compromise to reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Upside:** While there's a chance I could get a slightly higher price from Bob in the next round, it's not guaranteed.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a safe and reasonable outcome, considering the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

It's better to take the guaranteed profit now and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
