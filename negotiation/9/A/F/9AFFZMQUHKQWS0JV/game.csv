"I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $115. Can you consider that?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",117.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $112.50. Can you consider that?",112.5,Bob,6,
