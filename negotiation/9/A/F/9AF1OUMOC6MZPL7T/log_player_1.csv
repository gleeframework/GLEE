{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, at $20,000, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room for adjustments based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and well below my initial offer of $20,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a higher price.  I believe there's still room for compromise and a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $17,000?  It's still a good deal, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I've already found another seller who is willing to sell it to me for this price, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems Bob is determined to pay a price that's too low for me. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I don't lose out on a better deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  This is a more secure option than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
