"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) knowing that it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider $950000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better.  There's still a lot of negotiation room, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better deal. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I'm not ready to give up on a higher price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,000,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer with $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1010000. I hope this aligns better with our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,010,000 is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal. With only four rounds left, it's better to secure a good price than risk ending up with John's offer of $800,000."
