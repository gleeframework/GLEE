"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your purchase. Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer and the potential value of the product, $15000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in exploring a price closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $9000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but  I need to at least get $11000 for this product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway there.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
