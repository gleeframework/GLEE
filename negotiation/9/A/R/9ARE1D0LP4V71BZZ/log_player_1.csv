Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it won't be available for long."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and scarcity without being overly aggressive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $10,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
