Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your minimum acceptable price is met.  There's no incentive to go lower.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. Bob may accept outright, or it provides room to negotiate if needed.
* **Time Value:** While you haven't explicitly mentioned a time constraint, selling quickly to Bob avoids potential delays with John. This factor justifies aiming high initially."
