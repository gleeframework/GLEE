,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,500 is getting closer, but I need to get at least $14,500 for it.  Would you be willing to come up a little bit?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $14,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13750.0,Bob,6,
