"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be happy to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still within your budget, but also allows me to make a profit closer to my desired amount. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

Let me know if you're interested, or we can explore other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
