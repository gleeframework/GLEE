"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm confident you'll find this product valuable, and this price reflects its quality.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $85 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Let's meet at $90.  This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiations moving forward.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a bit more profit, but I'm getting close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $87, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up.  $87 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50?  That would make it a win-win for both of us, and we can close this deal.",88.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm not comfortable going above $87. I'm willing to make a final offer of $86.50. If you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you.",86.5,Bob,8,
